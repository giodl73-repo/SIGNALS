You are running the `draft-brainstorm` skill for the topic: {{topic}}

This skill runs in five phases: Pre-Phase (lenses), Phase 0 (inertia baseline),
Phase 1 (pool), Phase 2 (peer-comparison), Phase 3 (finalize). Complete each in order.

## Pre-Phase -- Generative Lenses

*Pre-Phase opens now. No preconditions.*

Before writing a single idea or establishing the inertia baseline, define 3 directions
that will actively pull the pool away from its center of gravity. These are production
constraints -- they determine which ideas appear in Phase 1, not which ideas survive
a post-hoc filter.

For each lens:
- **Lens name**: one phrase
- **Direction**: one sentence describing the shift axis
- **Pool impact**: what kinds of ideas appear under this lens that would not appear in a
  default brainstorm? Name candidate types, not framing differences.
- **Re-run test**: if a reader took only this lens and re-ran the brainstorm, would the
  resulting pool contain ideas not in the current pool? Different candidates, not the same
  candidates under different labels. If not, sharpen the lens before proceeding.

Write all 3 lenses. Do not begin Phase 0 until all 3 lenses pass the re-run test.

> **Pre-Phase complete.** Lenses defined and re-run verified:
> 1. [Lens 1 name] -- [one-word direction]
> 2. [Lens 2 name] -- [one-word direction]
> 3. [Lens 3 name] -- [one-word direction]
> All 3 pass the re-run test. Phase 0 opens now.

---

## Phase 0 -- Inertia Baseline

> **Phase 0 opens now.** No preconditions. Active lenses:
> 1. [Lens 1 name] -- [one-word direction]
> 2. [Lens 2 name] -- [one-word direction]
> 3. [Lens 3 name] -- [one-word direction]

Before generating any candidate ideas, fully specify the Do Nothing option for {{topic}}.

**Current Trajectory**: What is happening to {{topic}} right now with no deliberate
intervention? (2-3 sentences.)

**Accumulated Cost**: What concretely accumulates -- technically, organizationally, or for
users -- if this trajectory continues for 12 months? (2-3 sentences.)

**Displacement Target**: What must a competing idea change about the trajectory to beat
this baseline? State the minimum threshold: "A candidate beats Do Nothing if and only if
it [specific condition]." (1 sentence.)

**Do Nothing**:
```
**Pitch**: [One sentence summarizing the status quo trajectory from the analysis above]
**Rationale**: [The Accumulated Cost, compressed to one sentence]
```

> **Phase 0 complete.** All four fields written. Do Nothing established.

---

## Phase 1 -- Idea Pool

*Phase 1 requires: Phase 0 complete (all four fields + Do Nothing entry written).*

> **Phase 1 opens now.** Phase 0 complete. Do Nothing established. Active lenses:
> 1. [Lens 1 name] -- [one-word direction]
> 2. [Lens 2 name] -- [one-word direction]
> 3. [Lens 3 name] -- [one-word direction]

### 1a. Inertia Frame

Write a paragraph (3-5 sentences) expanding on the Phase 0 baseline for a general reader:
What is the current trajectory for {{topic}}? What does the team inherit if no deliberate
decision is made? What does the path of least resistance produce?

This paragraph must appear as the first element in the final artifact.

### 1b. Idea Pool

Using the 3 Pre-Phase lenses as active generation constraints, produce **19-39 additional
candidates** for {{topic}} -- for a total of 20-40 ideas including the Phase 0 Do Nothing
entry. Your output must contain one labeled section per required dimension. Each is a
**mandatory `##` section** -- do not collapse into a flat list, do not omit any.

**Required dimensions:**
- **Scope** -- how much of {{topic}}'s problem space is addressed
- **Timing** -- when the intervention lands in the product lifecycle
- **Integration** -- how it connects to existing systems or teams
- **Audience** -- who benefits most
- **Build vs. Buy** -- internal build, external adoption, or extension of existing
- **Status Quo** -- contains exactly the Do Nothing entry from Phase 0

**Lens attribution**: Tag at least 2 ideas per lens inline (e.g., `[Lens: Audience Shift]`).
Center-of-gravity ideas are permitted but must not dominate the pool.

**Do not mark top-5 yet.** Do not place any `**` markers on any idea during Phase 1.

For each idea (other than Do Nothing):
```
### [Idea Name]

**Pitch**: One sentence.
**Rationale**: Why this serves {{topic}} specifically -- cite a real constraint, user need,
or opportunity. Include one sentence naming how this idea changes the Phase 0 trajectory:
what specifically does it displace or prevent?
```

### 1c. AMEND Draft

Write a draft AMEND section with 3 pool-shift directions. For each:
- Name the shift axis
- Describe what kinds of ideas would appear or disappear
- Apply the distribution-shift test: re-running with only this directive must produce
  candidate ideas not in the current pool. Different candidates, not the same candidates
  under different framing.

Do not finalize AMEND yet -- it will be verified in Phase 2 Check C.

> **Phase 1 complete.** The full pool (19-39 net-new ideas + Do Nothing = 20-40 total) is
> written. AMEND draft written. No `**` marks in output. Phase 2 may begin.

---

## Phase 2 -- Peer-Comparison

*Phase 2 requires: Phase 1 complete ("Phase 1 complete." signal written above).*

> **Phase 2 opens now.** Phase 1 complete. Full pool written, AMEND drafted.

**Check A -- Sequential Default**
Are the top-5 candidates the first 5 ideas generated? If yes, rescan the full pool.

**Check B -- Peer-Comparison Registry**

Write one row per candidate.

| # | Candidate (exact name from pool) | Peer (exact name, same ## section, unmarked) | I chose [Candidate] over [Peer] because ___ | Selected? |
|---|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

Write all five "I chose ... because ___" sentences before evaluating any of them.

- **Candidate**: exact idea name from Phase 1b; one of the 5 from Check A
- **Peer**: exact name of one specific unmarked idea in the same `##` section; cannot
  be blank
- **"I chose ... because ___"**: complete the sentence with a specific reason tied to
  {{topic}}'s actual constraints; "it is better" or "more viable" do not count
- **Selected?**: Phase-advance gate. This column cannot hold any value, and Phase 3
  cannot begin, until both preconditions hold simultaneously: (a) all 5 rows of this
  Registry are written in your output, AND (b) Selected? is blank across all 5 rows.
  Phase 3 may begin only when the Registry is structurally complete (5 rows) and
  selection-clean (Selected? blank in every row).

**Prohibition A -- Marking Ban**: Do not place any `**` marks anywhere in your output
during Check B. No `**` marks may appear until the complete 5-row Registry is written.

**Prohibition B -- Rationalization Block**: If you cannot complete the comparison sentence
for any row -- no specific peer holds or no specific reason applies -- that candidate must
be replaced by the peer named in the Peer column. The replacement source is fixed: it is
the peer from this row, not an alternative selected after reconsidering. Do not revise the
candidate's rationale to manufacture a distinction that was not present at comparison time.

**Check C -- AMEND Distribution-Shift Test**
For each of the 3 AMEND directions from 1c, verify: re-running with only this directive
must surface candidate ideas not in the current pool. Sharpen any that would produce the
same candidates under different framing.

**Check D -- Inertia Placement**
Does the Phase 1a paragraph appear as the first element in the artifact? If not, reorder.

> **Phase 2 complete** when: all 5 Registry rows written, Selected? blank in every row,
> Checks A/C/D done, no `**` marks in output.

---

## Phase 3 -- Finalize

*Phase 3 requires: Phase 2 complete (5-row Registry written, Selected? blank in all rows).*

> **GATE PRECONDITIONS:**
> - **(a)** All 5 rows of the Peer-Comparison Registry are written in your output
> - **(b)** Selected? is blank across all 5 rows of the Registry

> **Phase 3 opens now.** Phase 2 complete. Peer-comparison validated. AMEND finalized.

Fill Selected? = YES in exactly 5 rows. Mark those 5 ideas with `**` on their headings
in the dimension sections. Use the AMEND content finalized in Check C.
