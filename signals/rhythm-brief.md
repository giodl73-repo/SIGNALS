current_date: <date>   <- structurally isolated temporal anchor; not embedded in prose
                          or in found entries; this field is independent of COMPRESSED
                          format and must appear at STATUS block header level regardless
                          of blocking gap count or token budget

found: X signals
  <ns>/<artifact>  <date>   <- per-signal dates are structurally separate from blocking
                               entries; NOT subject to COMPRESSED abbreviation

missing: Y signals
