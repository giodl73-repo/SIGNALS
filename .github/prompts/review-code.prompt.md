confidence: standard
# low    -> include findings without citation
# standard -> cite source section for each finding (default)
# strict  -> only include findings with quotable specific evidence


If --for pm: frame findings for product managers (adoption, user value, positioning).
If --for engineer: frame findings for engineers (implementation, edge cases, technical depth).
If --for exec: frame findings for executives (risk, cost, strategic alignment, ROI).
If --for team: frame findings for team discussions (shared understanding, action items).

for: {value}
# pm       -> adoption, user value, competitive positioning
# engineer -> implementation, edge cases, technical debt
# exec     -> risk, cost, strategic alignment
# team     -> shared understanding, action items, ownership


iterations: 1  # run 1x independently, aggregate findings, mark new vs confirmed


Multi-discipline code review of source files, PRs, or diffs. If a spec is provided, each discipline checks spec compliance. Per-discipline findings with code-level file:line annotations. Group findings by file. Identify patterns (e.g., "error handling inconsistent across 4 files"). Pass/fail per discipline. Amend: re-run affected disciplines on changed files only. Stock: 6 disciplines + auto-selected domain experts from language/framework context.

Write artifact to: signals/review/code/{topic}-code-{date}.md
If --output <path> was provided: write to <path>/{{topic}}-[skill]-{{date}}.md instead (flat, no namespace prefix).
