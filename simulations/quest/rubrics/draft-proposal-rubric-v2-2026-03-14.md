**Changes from v1:**

**Two new aspirational criteria added (C-10, C-11):**

- **C-10 — Scout artifact inventory step** (`behavior`): A dedicated inventory step before option generation — listing what was found and what is absent — is required. Satisfying C-05 does not automatically satisfy C-10. This encodes the V-01 failure: conditional mention in the recommendation phase is not a pass.

- **C-11 — Per-category amend taxonomy** (`behavior`): The amend phase must cover all three categories — missing option + unweighted criterion + follow-up action with owner. Single-category entries satisfy C-09 but not C-11. This converts C-09 from an optional depth signal into a structural self-audit.

**Other updates:**

- Aspirational denominator bumped from `/2` to `/4` in scoring formula
- Structure summary updated: 2 aspirational → 4 aspirational
- Most discriminating criterion corrected: C-02 → C-05, with explanation
- C-05 pass condition tightened: explicit rejection of conditional-mention pattern
- Common failure modes: added C-05/C-10 failure mode
- New "Round 1 Discriminator Correction" section explaining the falsification of v1's prediction
- Trace alignment notes extended to cover C-10 and C-11
ut presents at least 3 options. One must be a do-nothing or status-quo option. Options are numbered or labeled and appear as distinct entries, not embedded in prose. |
| C-02 | **Option anatomy complete** | correctness | Every option includes all required fields: description, pros/cons or trade-off notes, explicit risk (with probability and impact named), and explicit effort (with timeline and team or dependencies named). Missing any field on any option is a fail. |
| C-03 | **Recommendation with rationale** | correctness | Output contains a recommendation section naming the chosen option. Rationale explains why that option wins over alternatives. Confidence level or qualifying conditions present (at least 2-3 conditions). |
| C-04 | **Decision framing** | depth | Output frames the decision with: (1) the question being decided, (2) why it matters now (stakes, deadline, or cost of inaction). Framing must appear before the options, not after. |

## Recommended Criteria (30% of composite)

| ID | Criterion | Category | Pass Condition |
|----|-----------|----------|----------------|
| C-05 | **Scout artifact surfacing** | behavior | Output references at least one scout artifact (feasibility, competitors, requirements, or stakeholders) by name or finding. If no scout artifacts exist, output notes the absence and falls back to an inline assessment. Conditional mention in the recommendation phase only does not satisfy this criterion. |
| C-06 | **Dual-role participation** | format | PM and Architect roles each contribute a named perspective. PM addresses business or adoption trade-offs. Architect addresses technical constraints. Contributions are distinct, not interchangeable. |
| C-07 | **Structured comparison** | format | Options are compared in a table or matrix across shared dimensions (e.g., effort, friction, control, timeline). Dimensions are consistent across all options. |

---

## Aspirational Criteria (10% of composite)

| ID | Criterion | Category | Pass Condition |
|----|-----------|----------|----------------|
| C-08 | **Assumption and risk registers** | depth | Output includes both an assumption register (A-NN entries with validation plans) and a risk register (R-NN entries with probability and impact). At least two entries per register. |
| C-09 | **Amend phase self-critique** | behavior | Output identifies gaps in the proposal itself: missing options, unweighted decision criteria, or follow-up work needed. At least one actionable amend item listed. |
| C-10 | **Scout artifact inventory step** | behavior | A dedicated scout artifact inventory step appears before option generation. The output explicitly lists which scout artifacts were found (by name or finding) and which are absent, rather than mentioning artifacts conditionally in the recommendation phase only. If no artifacts exist, the absence is stated with an inline assessment substituted. Satisfying C-05 does not automatically satisfy C-10 -- the inventory must be a discrete step, not a byproduct of the recommendation. |
| C-11 | **Per-category amend taxonomy** | behavior | The amend phase covers all three categories: (1) at least one missing option that was not explored, (2) at least one unweighted or equally-weighted decision criterion flagged for recalibration, and (3) at least one follow-up action item with an owner or next step named. Single-category amend entries satisfy C-09 but not C-11. |

## Scoring Formula

```
composite = (essential_pass / 4 * 60)
          + (recommended_pass / 3 * 30)
          + (aspirational_pass / 4 * 10)
```

**Golden threshold**: all 4 essential criteria pass AND composite >= 80.

| Band | Score | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| Golden | all essential + >= 80 | Ready for use as a reference artifact |
| Passing | all essential + >= 60 | Usable with minor gaps |
| Failing | any essential fails | Output is not a valid proposal |

## Common Failure Modes

- Options presented as prose paragraphs with no structured trade-off fields (fails C-02)
- Recommendation present but no conditions or qualifying confidence named (fails C-03)
- Do-nothing or status-quo option missing entirely (fails C-01)
- Decision framed only technically -- no PM voice on "why now" or cost of inaction (fails C-04)
- Scout artifacts mentioned only in the recommendation phase ("if a scout artifact exists...") with no dedicated inventory step and no required fallback (fails C-05; also fails C-10)

## Round 1 Discriminator Correction

v1 predicted C-02 (option anatomy) as the most common failure mode. Round 1 scoring
falsified this. All five variations passed C-02 reliably because explicit field lists in
prompt text are sufficient enforcement. C-05 (scout artifact surfacing) was the actual
discriminator: V-01 failed it structurally by deferring to a conditional mention in the
recommendation phase. The new aspirational C-10 encodes the excellence pattern that
separated golden variations from V-01 -- a dedicated inventory step, not a conditional
reference.

C-11 encodes the second excellence pattern: the per-category amend taxonomy seen in
V-02/V-05 converts C-09 from an optional depth signal into a structural self-audit.
Variations that listed amend items without covering all three categories are compliant
with C-09 but fall short of the ceiling behavior.

## Trace Alignment Notes

The trace artifact (`plugin-draft-proposal-2026-03-14.md`) demonstrates:
- **C-01**: 4 options (A: skills-in-repo, B: plugin only, C: both, D: CREST) -- status-quo implicit in D
- **C-02**: Each option has description, pros via dimension table, cons/risk in Architect scoring
- **C-03**: Explicit recommendation (Option A for v0.1, C for v0.2), HIGH confidence, 3 conditions listed
- **C-04**: PM frames decision with 6-week all-hands deadline and cost of inaction stated
- **C-05**: Scout artifacts found -- competitors trace and feasibility trace (62/100 scoped)
- **C-06**: PM and Architect contribute distinct named sections
- **C-07**: Dimension comparison table with 6 rows across 4 options
- **C-08**: Assumption register (A1-A3) and risk register (R1-R2) both present
- **C-09**: Amend phase adds Option E, flags equal-weight criteria, notes community fork consideration
- **C-10**: Scout artifact inventory appears as a discrete pre-option step listing competitors trace and feasibility trace by name
- **C-11**: Amend phase covers all three categories -- Option E (missing option), equal-weight criteria flag (unweighted criterion), community fork follow-up (follow-up action)
