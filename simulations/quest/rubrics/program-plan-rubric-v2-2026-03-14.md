**What changed in v2:**

Three new aspirational criteria extracted from R1 excellence signals:

| ID | Criterion | Source pattern |
|----|-----------|----------------|
| C-11 | **Skill catalog grounded inline** | V-04 was the sole golden because it enumerated all 47 skills inline. The four that failed C-03 delegated to "see plugin-plan.md." One inline block = 12 essential points. |
| C-12 | **Actor-role framing for gates** | V-04's actor-ordering produced artifact-grounded gate conditions without extra instruction. Role-transition language ("before X can hand off to Y") is a structural forcing function for C-07. |
| C-13 | **Quantified gate syntax instructed** | V-05 got both C-09 and C-10 (the only variation to do so) because it embedded `>=N` syntax inside the gate-writing requirement. V-04 lacked this, capping its aspirational ceiling at 1/2. |

**Scoring adjustment:** aspirational grows from 10 pts (2 x 5) to 25 pts (5 x 5). Total moves to 115. Golden threshold adjusts from 80 to 92 (same ~80% of max). R1's best (V-04, 95/100) would retroactively score ~100/115 — the C-13 gap is what a combined V-04+V-05 variation would close in R2.
ntial Criteria (60 pts total)

| ID   | Criterion | Category | Pass Condition |
|------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| C-01 | **Valid YAML structure** | correctness | Output is valid YAML with a top-level `stages` key. Each stage has at minimum: `name` (string), `skills` (list), `gate` (string), and the echo stage has `auto: true`. No syntax errors. |
| C-02 | **Echo stage contract** | correctness | The last stage is named `echo`, has an empty `skills` list (or `skills: []`), and is marked `auto: true`. No other stage is named `echo`. |
| C-03 | **All referenced skills are valid** | correctness | Every skill listed in any stage's `skills` array is a real Signal plugin skill (from the 47-skill catalog across 9 namespaces). No invented, misspelled, or hallucinated skill names. |
| C-04 | **Gates are present and non-trivial** | correctness | Every non-echo stage has a `gate` value that expresses a real condition (not empty string, not "done", not "proceed"). Gate states what signals or artifacts must exist before advancing. |
| C-05 | **Skills are ordered by dependency** | correctness | Scout-namespace skills appear before draft-namespace skills; draft before review or prove; the sequence does not require artifacts that have not yet been produced by an earlier stage. |

Weight per essential: 12 pts (5 criteria x 12 = 60 pts)

## Recommended Criteria (30 pts total)

| ID   | Criterion | Category | Pass Condition |
|------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| C-06 | **Stages group skills meaningfully** | depth | Each stage represents a coherent phase of work (e.g., "discovery", "validation", "synthesis") -- not one skill per stage and not all skills dumped in one stage. Grouping reflects logical workflow cohesion. |
| C-07 | **Gate conditions reference artifacts** | depth | At least half of the non-echo gates name specific artifact types or signal counts (e.g., "scout-feasibility artifact present", "3+ scout signals present") rather than stating abstract completion. |
| C-08 | **Stage names are descriptive** | format | Stage names are human-readable labels that communicate the phase intent (e.g., `discovery`, `evidence`, `validation`) -- not generic (`stage1`, `step2`) and not skill names reused as stage names. |

Weight per recommended: 10 pts (3 criteria x 10 = 30 pts)

---

## Aspirational Criteria (25 pts total)

| ID   | Criterion | Category | Pass Condition |
|------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| C-09 | **Strategic pacing across signal types** | depth | The plan shows deliberate signal-building strategy: early stages produce breadth signals (scout, draft), middle stages produce depth signals (prove, review), late stages synthesize (topic). The program reflects a coherent evidence arc, not just topological sort. |
| C-10 | **Gates are quantified where possible** | behavior | At least one gate specifies a minimum signal count or threshold (e.g., `gate: ">=2 scout signals and draft-spec artifact present"`). Quantified gates are machine-checkable in principle. |
| C-11 | **Skill catalog grounded inline** | reliability | The variation enumerates all valid skill names organized by namespace inline in the prompt -- not by reference to an external file. This eliminates hallucination risk for C-03 at the source rather than relying on post-hoc validation. Pass if all 47 skills are listed inline; fail if the prompt delegates to "see plugin-plan.md" or "use the catalog." |
| C-12 | **Actor-role framing for gates** | depth | Gate conditions are written in actor-role transition language (e.g., "researcher needs X before designer can proceed", "PM sign-off requires Y") rather than abstract artifact checklists alone. Actor framing naturally grounds gates in workflow transitions and produces C-07-passing conditions without additional instruction. |
| C-13 | **Quantified gate syntax instructed** | behavior | The variation embeds a concrete `>=N signal_type` syntax example directly inside the gate-writing instruction (not only in a general examples section). The inline example drives machine-checkable threshold syntax in output, producing C-10-passing gates reliably. |

Weight per aspirational: 5 pts (5 criteria x 5 = 25 pts)

## Scoring Worksheet

```
Essential:    C-01 [ ] C-02 [ ] C-03 [ ] C-04 [ ] C-05 [ ]
              Pass count: ___ / 5   -> ___ * 12 = ___ pts (of 60)

Recommended:  C-06 [ ] C-07 [ ] C-08 [ ]
              Pass count: ___ / 3   -> ___ * 10 = ___ pts (of 30)

Aspirational: C-09 [ ] C-10 [ ] C-11 [ ] C-12 [ ] C-13 [ ]
              Pass count: ___ / 5   -> ___ * 5  = ___ pts (of 25)

Composite score: ___ / 115
Golden: all essential pass AND composite >= 92  ->  [ ] YES  [ ] NO
```

## Notes for Scorers

- **C-01**: Check YAML validity first. If YAML is invalid, score C-01 fail and note -- remaining
  criteria may still be partially assessable from intent.
- **C-02**: Echo stage is a hard contract. If missing or misplaced, C-02 fails regardless of
  otherwise good structure.
- **C-03**: Use the 47-skill catalog in `plugin-plan.md` as the authority for valid skill names.
  Namespace-qualified names (`scout:feasibility`) and unqualified names (`feasibility`) both
  acceptable if unambiguous.
- **C-05**: Dependency order is assessed by namespace layer (scout -> draft -> review/prove -> topic),
  not strict alphabetical. Within a namespace, order is flexible.
- **C-07**: "References artifacts" means the gate text includes artifact type names, not that it
  invokes the artifact system at runtime. This is a plan, not an executor.
- **C-11**: This is a prompt-design criterion evaluated on the variation, not the output. Check
  whether the variation text itself contains an inline listing of skills by namespace. A pointer
  like "refer to plugin-plan.md" fails; a block like "valid scout skills: feasibility, market,
  naming, ..." passes.
- **C-12**: Actor framing is assessed in the gate text of the output. Look for role-transition
  language ("before X can proceed", "Y needs Z to hand off") in addition to artifact references.
  Pure artifact lists without role context do not pass C-12.
- **C-13**: Distinguished from C-10 by scope: C-10 checks whether any output gate is quantified;
  C-13 checks whether the *variation* contains an embedded `>=N` syntax example inside its
  gate-writing instruction. A variation can pass C-13 but still fail C-10 (if the instruction
  is present but the model ignored it). A variation passes both when the instruction is present
  and the output uses the syntax.

## v1 -> v2 Delta

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Added C-11 | Skill catalog grounded inline -- from R1 finding: V-04 was the only golden because it enumerated all 47 skills; all others referenced external catalog and failed C-03 |
| Added C-12 | Actor-role framing for gates -- from R1 finding: V-04's actor-ordering implied artifact-grounded transitions without extra instruction; this pattern is worth capturing as a criterion |
| Added C-13 | Quantified gate syntax instructed -- from R1 finding: V-05 achieved both C-09 and C-10 (highest aspirational score) because it embedded `>=N` syntax in the requirement; V-04 did not, limiting its aspirational ceiling |
| Aspirational tier | 2 criteria x 5 pts -> 5 criteria x 5 pts = 25 pts |
| Total points | 100 -> 115 |
| Golden threshold | composite >= 80 -> composite >= 92 (same ~80% of max) |
| R1 best score retroactive | V-04 would score 95/115 (C-11 pass, C-12 partial, C-13 fail) |
