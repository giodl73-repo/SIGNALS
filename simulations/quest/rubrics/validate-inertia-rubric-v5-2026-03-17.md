Reading the three excellence signals from the R4 JSON to identify what's genuinely new vs. what strengthens existing pass conditions.

- **Signal 1** (table column for C-17): structural enforcement mechanism — this tightens C-17's pass condition, not a new criterion
- **Signal 2** (Part A / Part B with explicit disqualifier): new observable output — segregated labeling with a literal "does not satisfy" statement
- **Signal 3** (explicit reselection gate): new observable output — binary YES/NO at both horizons with a literal reselect instruction

Two new criteria: **C-19** and **C-20**. C-17's pass condition also gets tightened to name the column mechanism explicitly.

# Rubric -- validate-inertia v5

**Version:** v5
**Updated:** 2026-03-17
**Change from v4:** Added two new aspirational criteria (C-19, C-20) extracted from Round 4
excellence signals; tightened C-17 pass condition to name the table-column enforcement mechanism.

## Structure Summary

- **5 essential (C-01--C-05):** per-persona mapping, quantified switching cost, per-persona inertia
  scores, kill-barrier callout, aggregate risk verdict
- **3 recommended (C-06--C-08):** workaround satisfaction, habit lock-in + social proof coverage,
  mitigation path for the kill barrier
- **12 aspirational (C-09--C-20):** scoring methodology transparency, time-dependent inertia
  trajectory, status-quo competitor framing, named social proof threshold, mitigation tied to
  structural root cause, kill barrier temporal persistence test, causal chain with labeled
  structural sub-parts, mitigation confirmation signal, per-score methodology trace,
  kill-barrier trajectory verdict, related-output structural segregation with disqualifier,
  kill-barrier reselection gate

Scoring: Essential = 10 pts each (50 total), Recommended = 10 pts each (30 total), Aspirational =
10 pts each (120 total) = **200 pts max**.

## Essential Criteria (all must pass)

| ID | Text | Category | Pass Condition |
|----|------|----------|----------------|
| C-01 | **Per-persona inertia mapping** | correctness | Output identifies two or more named user personas and maps each to one or more inertia factors. Generic "users" without persona differentiation fails. |
| C-02 | **Quantified switching cost** | correctness | At least one persona has a switching cost expressed as a measurable value -- time, money, effort rating (1-10), or steps. Qualitative-only ("it's hard") fails. |
| C-03 | **Per-persona inertia score** | correctness | Each mapped persona has an explicit inertia score (numeric or Low/Medium/High/Critical). A single blanket score for all personas fails. |
| C-04 | **Kill-barrier identification** | depth | Output identifies exactly one adoption killer -- the single factor most likely to block adoption even if all other inertia is resolved. Must be labeled distinctly. |
| C-05 | **Overall adoption inertia risk** | correctness | Output produces an aggregate risk verdict with a sentence of rationale tying it back to the per-persona scores. |

---

## Recommended Criteria

| ID | Text | Category | Pass Condition |
|----|------|----------|----------------|
| C-06 | **Current workaround satisfaction assessed** | coverage | For at least one persona, output describes how satisfied they are with their current workaround and why that satisfaction creates inertia. |
| C-07 | **Habit lock-in and social proof addressed** | coverage | Output addresses habit lock-in AND social proof for at least one persona each. Missing both fails; covering one partially passes. |
| C-08 | **Mitigation path per critical barrier** | depth | For the kill barrier in C-04, output proposes at least one concrete mitigation that could reduce or eliminate that barrier. |

---

## Aspirational Criteria

| ID | Text | Category | Pass Condition |
|----|------|----------|----------------|
| C-09 | **Inertia score methodology explained** | behavior | Output briefly explains how inertia scores were derived -- what factors were weighted and why. A single sentence per dimension suffices. |
| C-10 | **Adoption timeline sensitivity** | depth | Output includes at least one time-dependent statement on how inertia evolves (e.g., "after 6 months of workaround use, lock-in doubles"). |
| C-11 | **Status-quo framed as named competitor** | depth | For the kill barrier in C-04, output names the dimension on which the current solution *wins* and explains why that competitive advantage is durable -- not just "people are used to it" but what property of the current solution makes it structurally hard to displace. |
| C-12 | **Named social proof threshold** | coverage | For at least one persona where social proof is a factor, output specifies the adoption threshold as a concrete condition or count (e.g., "needs 2+ teammates before committing," "will adopt solo if manager mandates it"). Binary Y/N without a named threshold fails. |
| C-13 | **Mitigation tied to structural root cause** | depth | The mitigation from C-08 explicitly explains *why* the intervention neutralizes the structural reason the barrier exists -- not just what to do, but why that lever addresses the specific root cause named in C-04. Addressing a symptom rather than the stated structural cause fails. |
| C-14 | **Kill barrier tested against temporal persistence** | depth | The kill barrier identified in C-04 is explicitly qualified against a temporal horizon -- output states that the barrier persists at T=0 AND remains unresolved at the longest time horizon considered (e.g., T=18mo). A kill barrier identified only as a current-state snapshot without temporal qualification fails. |
| C-15 | **Causal chain with labeled structural sub-parts** | depth | For the kill barrier, output provides a causal chain with explicitly labeled, distinct sub-parts covering: (1) what the barrier is, (2) why it structurally persists, (3) what the intervention targets, and (4) why that lever resolves the structural root cause. An analysis that merges any two sub-parts into a single statement, or that provides fewer than four labeled parts, fails. |
| C-16 | **Mitigation confirmation signal specified** | depth | The kill barrier mitigation from C-08 includes a named leading indicator or observable condition at a future time point (e.g., "at T=6mo, [X behavior] would confirm the barrier is reducing") that would confirm the intervention is working. A mitigation without a forward-looking confirmation condition fails. |
| C-17 | **Per-score methodology trace** | behavior | For each persona scored in C-03, output includes a derivation sentence that explicitly connects that persona's dimension values to the declared scoring threshold from C-09, showing how the score was produced. The strongest enforcement mechanism is a required column in the score table -- a column cannot be omitted without omitting the table, making non-compliance structurally visible. A global methodology declaration (C-09) without per-persona derivation fails. A trace that cites dimension values but not the threshold, or the threshold but not the dimension values, earns PARTIAL. |
| C-18 | **Kill-barrier trajectory verdict** | depth | Beyond any per-persona timeline grid satisfying C-10, output provides a separate, explicitly labeled verdict for the kill barrier's own time-sensitivity -- a trajectory direction (Resolving / Stable / Worsening) with structural reasoning tied to the persistence property identified in C-15(2). A verdict present in the grid only, without a dedicated kill-barrier trajectory statement, fails. |
| C-19 | **Related-output structural segregation with disqualifier** | behavior | When output produces two related but structurally distinct required outputs (e.g., a per-persona timeline grid satisfying C-10 and a kill-barrier trajectory verdict satisfying C-18), each is housed as an explicitly labeled sub-section AND the first sub-section includes a literal statement that it does not satisfy the second criterion. Absence of the explicit disqualifier statement fails; implicit separation without the disqualifier earns PARTIAL. |
| C-20 | **Kill-barrier reselection gate** | depth | The temporal persistence test for the kill barrier includes an explicit binary YES/NO confirmation that the barrier exists at T=0 AND persists at the longest time horizon considered, followed by a literal reselection instruction triggered if either answer is NO. Implicit persistence conveyed through a grid row or trajectory statement without a binary confirmation gate fails; a gate present at one horizon only earns PARTIAL. |

## Notes

- A rubric pass requires all 5 essential criteria to pass individually.
- Aspirational criteria may receive PARTIAL (5 pts) for genuine attempts that fall short of the
  full pass condition.
- C-19 and C-20 codify structural enforcement patterns first demonstrated in V-20: C-19 captures
  the Part A / Part B disqualifier mechanism that prevents one output from collapsing into
  another; C-20 captures the binary YES/NO reselection gate that upgrades implicit temporal
  persistence into an explicit confirmation requirement.
