The JSON summary lists 2 new patterns. Pattern 3 (preview-to-write back-reference) is already captured by existing C-09 — so two new aspirational criteria: C-11 and C-12. Denominator in the formula updates from 2 → 4.

# Scoring Rubric: signal-setup

## Skill Description
Configure Signal in a workspace after installation. Checks for existing CLAUDE.md and
.github/copilot-instructions.md, shows a preview, asks confirmation, then appends a
Signal section advertising available skills and the inertia rule. Safe to re-run —
detects existing Signal sections and skips.

---

## Essential Criteria

| ID | Criterion | Category | Pass Condition |
|----|-----------|----------|----------------|
| C-01 | **File detection before write** | correctness | Skill reads/checks for CLAUDE.md (and optionally copilot-instructions.md) before attempting any write. Does not blindly overwrite. |
| C-02 | **Preview shown before writing** | behavior | A preview of the Signal section content is displayed to the user prior to any file modification. |
| C-03 | **Confirmation required** | behavior | Skill explicitly asks user to confirm before writing. Does not write without a yes/proceed signal. |
| C-04 | **Signal section appended with skill advertising** | correctness | After confirmation, a Signal section is appended to CLAUDE.md that lists or references the available Signal skills (not an empty placeholder). |
| C-05 | **Idempotent re-run** | correctness | When run a second time on a workspace that already has a Signal section, the skill detects it and skips the write rather than duplicating content. |

---

## Recommended Criteria

| ID | Criterion | Category | Pass Condition |
|----|-----------|----------|----------------|
| C-06 | **Inertia rule included** | coverage | The appended Signal section explicitly includes or references the inertia rule (the principle that governs when a topic is ready). |
| C-07 | **Copilot instructions offered** | coverage | Skill offers (prompts or describes) an option to update .github/copilot-instructions.md in addition to CLAUDE.md. |
| C-08 | **User feedback on outcome** | format | After completing (or skipping), skill outputs a clear status message: what was written, what was skipped, and where. |

---

## Aspirational Criteria

| ID | Criterion | Category | Pass Condition |
|----|-----------|----------|----------------|
| C-09 | **Preview matches written output** | correctness | The previewed content is byte-for-byte (or semantically) identical to what is actually appended. No content drift between preview and write. |
| C-10 | **Handles missing CLAUDE.md gracefully** | behavior | If no CLAUDE.md exists, skill either creates one with the Signal section or clearly explains what it would create, without erroring out silently. |
| C-11 | **Named gate checkpoints as explicit phase boundaries** | structure | Each lifecycle phase (detect, preview, confirm, write, report) is named as a numbered gate or equivalent labeled checkpoint. No phase can be implicitly skipped — the structure of the spec itself enforces sequencing. |
| C-12 | **Edge-case paths promoted to first-class gates** | structure | The "already configured" and "missing CLAUDE.md" cases are handled as dedicated named gates (not inline conditionals inside the happy path). Each edge-case gate has its own complete, explicit treatment. |

## Scoring Formula

```
Composite = (essential_pass / 5 * 60)
          + (recommended_pass / 3 * 30)
          + (aspirational_pass / 4 * 10)
```

**Golden threshold**: All 5 essential criteria pass **AND** composite score ≥ 80.

| Band | Score | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| Golden | ≥ 80, all essential | Publish-ready |
| Passing | ≥ 60, all essential | Usable with known gaps |
| Failing | Any essential fails | Not usable |
```
