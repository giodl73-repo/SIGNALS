**Rubric summary:**

| Tier | Criteria | Key checks |
|------|----------|------------|
| Essential (60 pts) | C-01 to C-05 | Valid YAML structure, echo final stage, valid skill names, non-trivial gates, dependency-ordered skills |
| Recommended (30 pts) | C-06 to C-08 | Meaningful stage groupings, artifact-referencing gates, descriptive stage names |
| Aspirational (10 pts) | C-09 to C-10 | Evidence arc strategy, quantified gate thresholds |

The hardest essential is **C-02** (echo stage contract) — it's binary and unforgivable. The hardest recommended is **C-07** (gates reference artifacts) — this pushes the output from vague prose to traceable signal conditions. The aspirational pair together push toward a plan that reads like strategy, not just sorted skill names.
 correctness | The last stage is named `echo`, has an empty `skills` list (or `skills: []`), and is marked `auto: true`. No other stage is named `echo`. |
| C-03 | **All referenced skills are valid** | correctness | Every skill listed in any stage's `skills` array is a real Signal plugin skill (from the 47-skill catalog across 9 namespaces). No invented, misspelled, or hallucinated skill names. |
| C-04 | **Gates are present and non-trivial** | correctness | Every non-echo stage has a `gate` value that expresses a real condition (not empty string, not "done", not "proceed"). Gate states what signals or artifacts must exist before advancing. |
| C-05 | **Skills are ordered by dependency** | correctness | Scout-namespace skills appear before draft-namespace skills; draft before review or prove; the sequence does not require artifacts that have not yet been produced by an earlier stage. |

Weight per essential: 12 pts (5 criteria x 12 = 60 pts)

## Recommended Criteria (30 pts total)

| ID   | Criterion | Category | Pass Condition |
|------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| C-06 | **Stages group skills meaningfully** | depth | Each stage represents a coherent phase of work (e.g., "discovery", "validation", "synthesis") -- not one skill per stage and not all skills dumped in one stage. Grouping reflects logical workflow cohesion. |
| C-07 | **Gate conditions reference artifacts** | depth | At least half of the non-echo gates name specific artifact types or signal counts (e.g., "scout-feasibility artifact present", "3+ scout signals present") rather than stating abstract completion. |
| C-08 | **Stage names are descriptive** | format | Stage names are human-readable labels that communicate the phase intent (e.g., `discovery`, `evidence`, `validation`) -- not generic (`stage1`, `step2`) and not skill names reused as stage names. |

Weight per recommended: 10 pts (3 criteria x 10 = 30 pts)

## Aspirational Criteria (10 pts total)

| ID   | Criterion | Category | Pass Condition |
|------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| C-09 | **Strategic pacing across signal types** | depth | The plan shows deliberate signal-building strategy: early stages produce breadth signals (scout, draft), middle stages produce depth signals (prove, review), late stages synthesize (topic). The program reflects a coherent evidence arc, not just topological sort. |
| C-10 | **Gates are quantified where possible** | behavior | At least one gate specifies a minimum signal count or threshold (e.g., `gate: ">=2 scout signals and draft-spec artifact present"`). Quantified gates are machine-checkable in principle. |

Weight per aspirational: 5 pts (2 criteria x 5 = 10 pts)

```
Essential:    C-01 [ ] C-02 [ ] C-03 [ ] C-04 [ ] C-05 [ ]
              Pass count: ___ / 5   -> ___ * 12 = ___ pts (of 60)

Recommended:  C-06 [ ] C-07 [ ] C-08 [ ]
              Pass count: ___ / 3   -> ___ * 10 = ___ pts (of 30)

Aspirational: C-09 [ ] C-10 [ ]
              Pass count: ___ / 2   -> ___ * 5  = ___ pts (of 10)

Composite score: ___ / 100
Golden: all essential pass AND composite >= 80  ->  [ ] YES  [ ] NO

## Notes for Scorers

- **C-01**: Check YAML validity first. If YAML is invalid, score C-01 fail and note -- remaining
  criteria may still be partially assessable from intent.
- **C-02**: Echo stage is a hard contract. If missing or misplaced, C-02 fails regardless of
  otherwise good structure.
- **C-03**: Use the 47-skill catalog in `plugin-plan.md` as the authority for valid skill names.
  Namespace-qualified names (`scout:feasibility`) and unqualified names (`feasibility`) both
  acceptable if unambiguous.
- **C-05**: Dependency order is assessed by namespace layer (scout -> draft -> review/prove -> topic),
  not strict alphabetical. Within a namespace, order is flexible.
- **C-07**: "References artifacts" means the gate text includes artifact type names, not that it
  invokes the artifact system at runtime. This is a plan, not an executor.
