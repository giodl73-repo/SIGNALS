**Changes in v2**

**4 new aspirational criteria** extracted from Round 1 excellence signals:

| ID | Criterion | Signal source |
|----|-----------|---------------|
| C-11 | Decision Supplement Block Structure | V-01 fails C-08: DECISION type column + exits format cannot guarantee exhaustive outcomes; only a dedicated block with a `Fallback:` field closes the gap |
| C-12 | Role Registry Gate | V-05 > V-03 on C-03: pre-declared R-ID registry with anti-generic checklist before state tracing is structurally more reliable than role-list hints in a profile section |
| C-13 | Phase-Scoped Exception Traces | V-03/V-05 > V-02/V-04 on C-02 specificity: per-phase exception sections scope failure-mode generation to phase context without extra instructions |
| C-14 | SLA-to-Bottleneck Evidence Chain | V-02/V-04/V-05 > V-01/V-03 on C-10 coherence: a `Bottleneck Cross-Ref` column links timing risk to B-NN causal analysis; without it the SLA section is diagnostically unlinked |

**Scoring formula updated**: aspirational denominator changes from `/2` to `/6`; aspirational total remains 10 pts. Golden threshold (all essential + composite >= 80) is unchanged.
ery branch has labeled condition + owner role + fallback | format |

**6 Aspirational (10 pts)**
| ID | Criterion | Category |
|----|-----------|----------|
| C-09 | Cross-Process Interaction Modeling -- at least one inter-process handoff contract | depth |
| C-10 | SLA and Timing Analysis -- 3+ nodes annotated with SLA vs. typical, at-risk flags | depth |
| C-11 | Decision Supplement Block Structure -- per-decision structured block with Fallback field | format |

## Essential Criteria (60 pts total)

### C-01 - State Transition Coverage
- **Weight**: essential
- **Category**: correctness
- **Text**: Every state in the lifecycle has an explicitly labeled entry condition and at
  least one labeled exit. No state is left dangling with an implicit or undeclared
  transition. The coverage spans the full process from initial trigger to terminal state.
- **Pass condition**: Each state has a named entry condition and one or more labeled exits.
  Exits must reference the destination state or be marked TERMINAL. Fail if any state
  lacks an entry condition or has an unlabeled exit.

### C-02 - Exception Flow Identification
- **Weight**: essential
- **Category**: coverage
- **Text**: The output identifies at least three distinct exception flows: named failure
  modes that deviate from the happy path. Each exception trace follows the path from
  trigger to resolution or terminal. Each must be specific to the process being
  simulated, not generic boilerplate.
- **Pass condition**: Three or more exception flows, each with: trigger condition, trace
  of states traversed, handling role, and resolution or terminal. Each must be specific
  to the process being simulated, not generic boilerplate.

### C-03 - Role Assignment Accuracy
- **Weight**: essential
- **Category**: correctness
- **Text**: Domain expert roles are auto-selected from the process context and assigned to
  specific decision points or approval gates. Role set matches the declared process type.
- **Pass condition**: Each approval gate or decision point is owned by a named role.
  Role set matches the process type: L2O -> Sales/Finance/Legal; P2P -> Procurement/Finance/
  Receiving; period close -> Finance/Controller/Auditor; case -> Support/Ops/Legal.
  Fail if roles are generic (Approver) with no domain specificity.

### C-04 - Bottleneck and Gap Identification
- **Weight**: essential
- **Category**: depth
- **Text**: The output explicitly calls out at least two bottlenecks (states or transitions
  where delays commonly accumulate) and at least one gap (a step missing from the flow that
  exists in real-world practice).
- **Pass condition**: Each bottleneck is labeled, its cause explained, and its downstream
  impact noted. Each gap is labeled MISSING: with a rationale for why it belongs. Fail if
  findings are stated without causal explanation.

### C-05 - Terminal State Completeness
- **Weight**: essential
- **Category**: correctness
- **Text**: All terminal states are identified -- both successful completion and
  failure/cancellation states. Every trace path reaches a terminal state; no path ends
  in a non-terminal state without a continuation or loop marker.
- **Pass condition**: At least two terminal states (one success, one failure/cancel). Every
  branch reaches a declared terminal state. Fail if any branch ends mid-flow without a
  terminal label or explicit continues-via pointer.

## Recommended Criteria (30 pts total)

### C-06 - Parallel Path Modeling
- **Weight**: recommended
- **Category**: depth
- **Text**: Where the real process has concurrent work streams (e.g., credit check parallel
  to inventory reservation in L2O; goods receipt concurrent with invoice processing in P2P),
  the output models these explicitly with join/synchronization points.
- **Pass condition**: At least one parallel path is present with both branches and a labeled
  synchronization point. Join condition must be specified (AND-join vs OR-join). Fail if
  parallelism is described only in prose without structural representation.

### C-07 - Edge Case Enumeration
- **Weight**: recommended
- **Category**: coverage
- **Text**: The output surfaces at least three edge cases that are never handled or handled
  inconsistently -- scenarios that exist in practice but fall outside the documented happy
  path and exception flows.
- **Pass condition**: Three distinct edge cases, each non-overlapping with C-02 exception
  flows. Each must include: triggering condition, why it is problematic, and what a correct
  response would look like. Fail if edge cases duplicate named exception flows.

### C-08 - Decision Point Explicitness
- **Weight**: recommended
- **Category**: format
- **Text**: Every decision point (branch) in the flow is accompanied by: the rule or
  condition being evaluated, the agent/role that evaluates it, and all possible outcomes.
  No implicit branching.
- **Pass condition**: Each decision point has a labeled condition, an owner role, and
  exhaustive outcome branches including a fallback branch if applicable. Fail if any branch
  originates from an unlabeled or condition-free node.

## Aspirational Criteria (10 pts total)

### C-09 - Cross-Process Interaction Modeling
- **Weight**: aspirational
- **Category**: depth
- **Text**: The output identifies at least one point where the simulated lifecycle touches
  an adjacent process and traces the inter-process signal: what data crosses, who sends it,
  what the receiving process expects.
- **Pass condition**: At least one cross-process interaction is named, with sending state,
  receiving process, data payload, and expected acknowledgment described. Fail if adjacent
  processes are mentioned without any interface definition.

### C-10 - SLA and Timing Analysis
- **Weight**: aspirational
- **Category**: depth
- **Text**: The output attaches realistic timing expectations or SLA targets to at least
  three transitions or states, and flags any transition whose typical duration exceeds its
  SLA target as a risk.
- **Pass condition**: Three or more states/transitions have timing annotations with
  explicit at-risk callouts where typical exceeds SLA. Fail if timing is absent entirely
  or applied to fewer than three nodes.

### C-11 - Decision Supplement Block Structure
- **Weight**: aspirational
- **Category**: format
- **Text**: Round 1 signal: DECISION type column annotation and exits format are
  structurally insufficient for exhaustive outcome coverage. A dedicated per-decision
  supplement block with explicitly labeled fields -- Condition, Owner, Branch YES, Branch
  NO, Fallback -- is required to guarantee that no decision point omits a fallback path.
  Inline annotation leaves this gap open.
- **Pass condition**: Each decision point in the output has a dedicated structured block
  (not just a column annotation or inline note) with: Condition, Owner, at least two
  outcome branches, and an explicit Fallback field. Fail if decision coverage is provided
  only through type-column annotation without a supplement block per decision point.

### C-12 - Role Registry Gate
- **Weight**: aspirational
- **Category**: correctness
- **Text**: Round 1 signal: A pre-declared role registry with explicit anti-generic
  validation, completed before any state is traced, prevents C-03 generic-name failure
  more reliably than role-list hints or column suggestions. The registry assigns R-IDs to
  domain-specific roles and is referenced at every decision point and approval gate.
- **Pass condition**: A role registry with at least one entry per process-type domain
  (R-NN IDs, role name, function, anti-generic check) is declared before the first state
  is traced. Every decision point and approval gate references an R-ID, not a free-text
  role name. Fail if role assignment is done inline without a pre-declared registry, or if
  any role name is generic (Approver, Owner, Actor) without domain qualification.

### C-13 - Phase-Scoped Exception Traces
- **Weight**: aspirational
- **Category**: coverage
- **Text**: Round 1 signal: Exception traces anchored to the phase where the failure
  originates improve C-02 specificity by scoping failure-mode generation to phase context
  without additional instructions. A flat exception table produces generic cross-flow
  traces; per-phase exception sections produce phase-specific, operationally accurate
  failure modes.
- **Pass condition**: Each exception trace is labeled with the phase or state where it
  originates. Exception traces are grouped or annotated by phase, not presented as a flat
  undifferentiated list. Fail if exception flows are listed without phase or state
  anchoring, making it impossible to determine where in the lifecycle each failure occurs.

### C-14 - SLA-to-Bottleneck Evidence Chain
- **Weight**: aspirational
- **Category**: depth
- **Text**: Round 1 signal: SLA at-risk annotations gain diagnostic precision when
  cross-referenced to identified bottleneck IDs (B-NN). This creates a closed evidence
  chain: a timing risk is not a free-floating observation but is causally linked to a
  named bottleneck with an explained cause and downstream impact. Outputs without this
  cross-reference provide SLA risk flags that are disconnected from the bottleneck
  analysis.
- **Pass condition**: At least two SLA at-risk entries reference a bottleneck ID (B-NN)
  from the C-04 bottleneck analysis. The cross-reference must be explicit (e.g., "see
  B-02" or a cross-ref column). Fail if SLA at-risk flags are present but no bottleneck
  cross-reference exists, leaving timing risk causally unlinked.

## Scoring Formula

    composite = (essential_pass / 5 * 60)
              + (recommended_pass / 3 * 30)
              + (aspirational_pass / 6 * 10)

**Golden threshold**: all 5 essential criteria pass AND composite >= 80.

| Band   | Score                   | Meaning                                  |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Gold   | >= 80 + all essential   | Output is production-ready signal artifact |
| Silver | >= 65 + all essential   | Useful with minor gaps                   |
| Bronze | >= 50 + all essential   | Usable but incomplete                    |
| Fail   | any essential fails     | Not useful regardless of score           |

## Evaluation Notes

- Grade each criterion pass/fail -- no partial credit per criterion.
- For C-01 and C-05 use the state diagram or trace table as the evidence base.
- For C-02 and C-07 verify that exception flows and edge cases are non-overlapping and
  process-specific before counting toward their respective totals.
- For C-03 verify the role set matches the declared process type.
- For C-06 the parallel path may be represented as a fork/join diagram, a two-column table,
  or explicit prose with a labeled synchronization point -- any structural form counts.
- For C-08 a pass requires a fallback branch; type-column annotation alone does not satisfy
  the exhaustive outcome requirement (see C-11 for the stronger structural form).
- For C-11 a dedicated block per decision point is required; column annotation is not
  sufficient even if it includes a Fallback column.
- For C-12 the registry must precede the first state trace; a role list embedded in a
  process profile section does not satisfy the gate requirement.
- For C-13 count only traces that are explicitly labeled with their originating phase or
  state; flat lists without phase anchoring do not qualify even if the trace text mentions
  a phase incidentally.
- For C-14 the cross-reference must be explicit and bidirectional: the SLA at-risk entry
  names the B-NN, or the B-NN entry notes the SLA impact. Prose mention without ID
  linkage does not satisfy.
