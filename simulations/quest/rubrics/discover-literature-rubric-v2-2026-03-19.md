Written to `simulations/quest/rubrics/discover-literature-rubric-v2-2026-03-19.md`.

**What changed from v1:**

Four new aspirational criteria extracted from R1 signals:

| # | Name | Source | The pattern |
|---|------|--------|-------------|
| C-11 | Interrogative Obligation Satisfied | V-04 | Questions force specific answers; imperatives allow vague prose. Pass if >= 80% of phase-gate questions get non-generic answers. |
| C-12 | Anti-Placeholder Recovery Executed | V-04 + V-02 | "If a cell is unknown, search again" closes the escape hatch that "no placeholders" alone leaves open. Any unacknowledged placeholder cell fails. |
| C-13 | Empty-Tier Acknowledgment Present | V-04 | Requires "NONE FOUND + reason" for any empty tier. Prevents silent omission from being indistinguishable from a complete pass. |
| C-14 | Inertia Guard on PROCEED | V-05 | Gap analysis must name why a team might do nothing. A PROCEED recommendation must explain why evidence overcomes inertia. |

Aspirational max points expand from 10 to 30 (6 criteria x 5 pts). Total ceiling is now 120 with the same golden bar threshold (composite >= 80).
ing

| Tier | Criteria | Points each | Max |
|------|----------|-------------|-----|
| Essential | C-01..C-05 | 12 | 60 |
| Recommended | C-06..C-08 | 10 | 30 |
| Aspirational | C-09..C-14 | 5 | 30 |
| **Total** | | | **120** |

Composite score = points earned / 100 * 100 (capped at 100 for golden bar purposes). Golden bar = all essential pass AND composite >= 80.

## ESSENTIAL Criteria (60 points -- all must pass for golden bar)

### C-01 Claims Extracted Before Search
- **Category**: correctness
- **Weight**: essential
- **Text**: Phase 1 extracts a list of specific, falsifiable claims from the topic and identifies what contrary evidence would undermine each before any search begins.
- **Pass condition**: At least 3 distinct claims appear in Phase 1 output, each stated as a proposition (not a question). Each claim is accompanied by a note on what contrary evidence would undermine it.

### C-02 Citation Table Present
- **Category**: format
- **Weight**: essential
- **Text**: Phase 2 produces a citation table with all required columns for each source found.
- **Pass condition**: At least one Markdown table appears with columns Title, Authors, Year, Venue, Claim #, Position (supports/contradicts/qualifies), and Key finding. Rows contain non-placeholder values.

### C-03 Four-Tier Literature Map Built
- **Category**: correctness
- **Weight**: essential
- **Text**: Phase 3 organizes sources into FOUNDATIONAL, RECENT, CONTRARY, and METHODOLOGICAL tiers, each with at least one entry and a one-sentence justification.
- **Pass condition**: All four tier headings appear; each tier has >= 1 cited source with a justification sentence. RECENT tier entries are dated 2020 or later.

### C-04 Gap Analysis Recommendation Issued
- **Category**: correctness
- **Weight**: essential
- **Text**: Phase 4 states claims with strong vs. weak support, lists contrary evidence to address, and issues a PROCEED / SEARCH MORE / REFRAME CLAIM recommendation.
- **Pass condition**: Output contains a gap analysis block with counts of supported vs. unsupported claims, at least one item under contrary evidence (or explicit "none"), and a clearly stated recommendation keyword (PROCEED, SEARCH MORE, or REFRAME CLAIM).

### C-05 Artifact Written with Required Frontmatter
- **Category**: behavior
- **Weight**: essential
- **Text**: Skill writes a signal artifact to the correct path with all required frontmatter fields.
- **Pass condition**: A file exists at signals/discover/literature/{topic}-literature-{date}.md (or the --output path). Frontmatter contains skill, topic, date, claims_checked, sources_found, and high_risk_claims fields, all populated with non-null values.

---

## RECOMMENDED Criteria (30 points -- output is better with these)

### C-06 Contrary Evidence Mapped to Claims
- **Category**: depth
- **Weight**: recommended
- **Text**: Phase 3 CONTRARY tier maps each contrary paper back to the specific claim it challenges, and Phase 5 identifies the single most dangerous contrary paper with a suggested response framing.
- **Pass condition**: Each CONTRARY entry references a claim number or label. Phase 5 item 2 names the contrary paper and proposes a rebuttal direction (scope qualification, methodological distinction, or domain limitation).

### C-07 WebSearch Evidence Visible
- **Category**: behavior
- **Weight**: recommended
- **Text**: The artifact shows evidence of actual WebSearch execution -- real titles, authors, years, and venues rather than generic placeholders.
- **Pass condition**: At least 5 distinct sources appear with real author names, publication years between 1990-2025, and venue names (journal, conference, or preprint server). No row contains placeholder text such as "Author et al." or "[title]".

### C-08 High-Risk Claims Flagged
- **Category**: coverage
- **Weight**: recommended
- **Text**: Any claim with no supporting literature and strong contrary evidence is explicitly flagged HIGH RISK with a scoping or reframing suggestion.
- **Pass condition**: If high_risk_claims >= 1 in frontmatter, the body contains a HIGH RISK block per flagged claim with a concrete suggestion (scope, qualify, or drop). If high_risk_claims = 0, the gap analysis explicitly states why no claim is at risk.

## ASPIRATIONAL Criteria (30 points -- raise the bar once essential/recommended are stable)

### C-09 Depth Mode Source Threshold Met
- **Category**: coverage
- **Weight**: aspirational
- **Text**: Source count meets the threshold for the active depth mode (quick >= 5, standard >= 15, deep >= 25).
- **Pass condition**: sources_found in frontmatter >= threshold for the active depth mode. Pass if threshold is met or exceeded.

### C-10 Methodological Precedent Chain
- **Category**: depth
- **Weight**: aspirational
- **Text**: The METHODOLOGICAL tier forms a traceable precedent chain -- each entry identifies the paper that established the method and its publication year, showing the method predates the current work.
- **Pass condition**: Each METHODOLOGICAL entry names the originating paper and includes a year. The chain shows the method was established before the current work (all years < current paper year).

### C-11 Interrogative Obligation Satisfied
- **Category**: correctness
- **Weight**: aspirational
- **Source**: V-04 R1 excellence signal
- **Text**: Every phase-gate is structured as questions the run must answer, not imperatives it may satisfy with vague prose. Each question receives a specific, non-generic answer.
- **Pass condition**: Each phase output contains numbered or labeled answers corresponding to the questions posed in the skill prompt. No question is skipped or deflected with a non-answer ("N/A", "see above", generic restatement of the question). Pass if >= 80% of questions receive specific answers.

### C-12 Anti-Placeholder Recovery Executed
- **Category**: behavior
- **Weight**: aspirational
- **Source**: V-04 + V-02 R1 excellence signal
- **Text**: When a citation cell is unknown at first pass, the skill searches again rather than leaving a placeholder. The recovery step is either successful (cell filled with real data) or explicitly acknowledged (noted as "not found after secondary search").
- **Pass condition**: Zero unacknowledged placeholder cells in the citation table. Any cell that could not be filled shows one of: (a) real data from a follow-up search, or (b) an explicit "not found after secondary search" note. A cell containing "Author et al.", "[title]", "TBD", or similar generic text with no recovery note is a failure.

### C-13 Empty-Tier Acknowledgment Present
- **Category**: coverage
- **Weight**: aspirational
- **Source**: V-04 R1 excellence signal
- **Text**: Any four-tier map tier with zero entries contains an explicit "NONE FOUND" statement and a one-sentence explanation of why no sources qualified -- preventing silent omission from being indistinguishable from a complete pass.
- **Pass condition**: For each of the four tiers (FOUNDATIONAL, RECENT, CONTRARY, METHODOLOGICAL), either: (a) at least one cited source appears, or (b) the tier contains "NONE FOUND" followed by a reason sentence (e.g., "No papers directly challenge this claim domain in the searched venues"). A tier heading with no entries and no acknowledgment is a failure.

### C-14 Inertia Guard on PROCEED
- **Category**: correctness
- **Weight**: aspirational
- **Source**: V-05 R1 excellence signal
- **Text**: The gap analysis explicitly considers the inertia scenario before issuing PROCEED -- acknowledging that teams may do nothing even with strong evidence, and that the recommendation accounts for what would make inertia the dominant path.
- **Pass condition**: The gap analysis block contains a sentence or subsection that names the inertia risk: why a team might ignore this literature and do nothing. If the recommendation is PROCEED, it must address why the evidence is strong enough to overcome inertia. If SEARCH MORE or REFRAME CLAIM, inertia risk may be noted without counter-argument.
