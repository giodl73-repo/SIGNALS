# discover-literature Rubric — v3

**What changed from v2:**

Two new aspirational criteria extracted from R2 excellence signals:

| # | Name | Source | The pattern |
|---|------|--------|-------------|
| C-15 | Dual-Domain Obligation Preamble | V-05 R2 | An opening frame that names both the anti-placeholder recovery obligation (C-12) and the empty-tier acknowledgment obligation (C-13) as non-optional, before Phase 1 begins, is more reliable than per-phase rules. A global enforcement contract that precedes every phase closes both escape hatches simultaneously. |
| C-16 | Template-Label Checkability | V-05 R2 | Structural gates that produce named output tokens (e.g., `INERTIA SCENARIO:` / `INERTIA RISK:`) are grep-verifiable and cannot be satisfied with vague prose. Any structural gate benefits from producing a named token that an automated scorer or human reviewer can find without inference. |

Aspirational max points expand from 30 to 40 (8 criteria x 5 pts). Total ceiling is now 130 with the same golden bar threshold (composite >= 80).

| Tier | Criteria | Points each | Max |
|------|----------|-------------|-----|
| Essential | C-01..C-05 | 12 | 60 |
| Recommended | C-06..C-08 | 10 | 30 |
| Aspirational | C-09..C-16 | 5 | 40 |
| **Total** | | | **130** |

Composite score = points earned / 100 * 100 (capped at 100 for golden bar purposes). Golden bar = all essential pass AND composite >= 80.

## ESSENTIAL Criteria (60 points -- all must pass for golden bar)

### C-01 Claims Extracted Before Search
- **Category**: correctness
- **Weight**: essential
- **Text**: Phase 1 extracts a list of specific, falsifiable claims from the topic and identifies what contrary evidence would undermine each before any search begins.
- **Pass condition**: At least 3 distinct claims appear in Phase 1 output, each stated as a proposition (not a question). Each claim is accompanied by a note on what contrary evidence would undermine it.

### C-02 Citation Table Present
- **Category**: format
- **Weight**: essential
- **Text**: Phase 2 produces a citation table with all required columns for each source found.
- **Pass condition**: At least one Markdown table appears with columns Title, Authors, Year, Venue, Claim #, Position (supports/contradicts/qualifies), and Key finding. Rows contain non-placeholder values.

### C-03 Four-Tier Literature Map Built
- **Category**: correctness
- **Weight**: essential
- **Text**: Phase 3 organizes sources into FOUNDATIONAL, RECENT, CONTRARY, and METHODOLOGICAL tiers, each with at least one entry and a one-sentence justification.
- **Pass condition**: All four tier headings appear; each tier has >= 1 cited source with a justification sentence. RECENT tier entries are dated 2020 or later.

### C-04 Gap Analysis Recommendation Issued
- **Category**: correctness
- **Weight**: essential
- **Text**: Phase 4 states claims with strong vs. weak support, lists contrary evidence to address, and issues a PROCEED / SEARCH MORE / REFRAME CLAIM recommendation.
- **Pass condition**: Output contains a gap analysis block with counts of supported vs. unsupported claims, at least one item under contrary evidence (or explicit "none"), and a clearly stated recommendation keyword (PROCEED, SEARCH MORE, or REFRAME CLAIM).

### C-05 Artifact Written with Required Frontmatter
- **Category**: behavior
- **Weight**: essential
- **Text**: Skill writes a signal artifact to the correct path with all required frontmatter fields.
- **Pass condition**: A file exists at `signals/discover/literature/{topic}-literature-{date}.md` (or the `--output` path). Frontmatter contains skill, topic, date, claims_checked, sources_found, and high_risk_claims fields, all populated with non-null values.

---

## RECOMMENDED Criteria (30 points -- output is better with these)

### C-06 Contrary Evidence Mapped to Claims
- **Category**: depth
- **Weight**: recommended
- **Text**: Phase 3 CONTRARY tier maps each contrary paper back to the specific claim it challenges, and Phase 5 identifies the single most dangerous contrary paper with a suggested response framing.
- **Pass condition**: Each CONTRARY entry references a claim number or label. Phase 5 item 2 names the contrary paper and proposes a rebuttal direction (scope qualification, methodological distinction, or domain limitation).

### C-07 WebSearch Evidence Visible
- **Category**: behavior
- **Weight**: recommended
- **Text**: The artifact shows evidence of actual WebSearch execution -- real titles, authors, years, and venues rather than generic placeholders.
- **Pass condition**: At least 5 distinct sources appear with real author names, publication years between 1990-2025, and venue names (journal, conference, or preprint server). No row contains placeholder text such as "Author et al." or "[title]".

### C-08 High-Risk Claims Flagged
- **Category**: coverage
- **Weight**: recommended
- **Text**: Any claim with no supporting literature and strong contrary evidence is explicitly flagged HIGH RISK with a scoping or reframing suggestion.
- **Pass condition**: If high_risk_claims >= 1 in frontmatter, the body contains a HIGH RISK block per flagged claim with a concrete suggestion (scope, qualify, or drop). If high_risk_claims = 0, the gap analysis explicitly states why no claim is at risk.

---

## ASPIRATIONAL Criteria (40 points -- raise the bar once essential/recommended are stable)

### C-09 Depth Mode Source Threshold Met
- **Category**: coverage
- **Weight**: aspirational
- **Text**: Source count meets the threshold for the active depth mode (quick >= 5, standard >= 15, deep >= 25).
- **Pass condition**: sources_found in frontmatter >= threshold for the active depth mode. Pass if threshold is met or exceeded.

### C-10 Methodological Precedent Chain
- **Category**: depth
- **Weight**: aspirational
- **Text**: The METHODOLOGICAL tier forms a traceable precedent chain -- each entry identifies the paper that established the method and its publication year, showing the method predates the current work.
- **Pass condition**: Each METHODOLOGICAL entry names the originating paper and includes a year. The chain shows the method was established before the current work (all years < current paper year).

### C-11 Interrogative Obligation Satisfied
- **Category**: correctness
- **Weight**: aspirational
- **Source**: V-04 R1 excellence signal
- **Text**: Every phase-gate is structured as questions the run must answer, not imperatives it may satisfy with vague prose. Each question receives a specific, non-generic answer.
- **Pass condition**: Each phase output contains numbered or labeled answers corresponding to the questions posed in the skill prompt. No question is skipped or deflected with a non-answer ("N/A", "see above", generic restatement of the question). Pass if >= 80% of questions receive specific answers.

### C-12 Anti-Placeholder Recovery Executed
- **Category**: behavior
- **Weight**: aspirational
- **Source**: V-04 + V-02 R1 excellence signal
- **Text**: When a citation cell is unknown at first pass, the skill searches again rather than leaving a placeholder. The recovery step is either successful (cell filled with real data) or explicitly acknowledged (noted as "not found after secondary search").
- **Pass condition**: Zero unacknowledged placeholder cells in the citation table. Any cell that could not be filled shows one of: (a) real data from a follow-up search, or (b) an explicit "not found after secondary search" note. A cell containing "Author et al.", "[title]", "TBD", or similar generic text with no recovery note is a failure.

### C-13 Empty-Tier Acknowledgment Present
- **Category**: coverage
- **Weight**: aspirational
- **Source**: V-04 R1 excellence signal
- **Text**: Any four-tier map tier with zero entries contains an explicit "NONE FOUND" statement and a one-sentence explanation of why no sources qualified -- preventing silent omission from being indistinguishable from a complete pass.
- **Pass condition**: For each of the four tiers (FOUNDATIONAL, RECENT, CONTRARY, METHODOLOGICAL), either: (a) at least one cited source appears, or (b) the tier contains "NONE FOUND" followed by a reason sentence. A tier heading with no entries and no acknowledgment is a failure.

### C-14 Inertia Guard on PROCEED
- **Category**: correctness
- **Weight**: aspirational
- **Source**: V-05 R1 excellence signal
- **Text**: The gap analysis explicitly considers the inertia scenario before issuing PROCEED -- acknowledging that teams may do nothing even with strong evidence, and that the recommendation accounts for what would make inertia the dominant path.
- **Pass condition**: The gap analysis block contains a sentence or subsection that names the inertia risk: why a team might ignore this literature and do nothing. If the recommendation is PROCEED, it must address why the evidence is strong enough to overcome inertia. If SEARCH MORE or REFRAME CLAIM, inertia risk may be noted without counter-argument.

### C-15 Dual-Domain Obligation Preamble
- **Category**: behavior
- **Weight**: aspirational
- **Source**: V-05 R2 excellence signal
- **Text**: The skill output opens with a preamble (before Phase 1 content) that states both the anti-placeholder recovery obligation and the empty-tier acknowledgment obligation as non-optional constraints applying to every subsequent phase. A global enforcement contract is more reliable than per-phase rules because it cannot be silently dropped when a phase is skipped or abbreviated.
- **Pass condition**: A preamble section appears before Phase 1 output that explicitly names both: (a) the recovery obligation -- any unknown cell must be searched again or noted as "not found after secondary search", and (b) the empty-tier obligation -- any tier with no entries must state "NONE FOUND" with a reason. Both must be framed as non-optional. A preamble covering only one of the two obligations is a PARTIAL, not a PASS.

### C-16 Template-Label Checkability
- **Category**: behavior
- **Weight**: aspirational
- **Source**: V-05 R2 excellence signal
- **Text**: Structural gates produce named output tokens rather than prose descriptions, making compliance grep-verifiable rather than inference-dependent. Any gate that can be satisfied with vague prose is weaker than one that requires a specific labeled field in the output.
- **Pass condition**: At minimum, the C-14 inertia gate output contains the tokens `INERTIA SCENARIO:` and `INERTIA RISK:` as labeled fields. Any other structural gate introduced by the skill variant also uses a named token. A structural gate whose compliance must be inferred from surrounding prose is a failure for this criterion.

## Changelog

| Version | Date | Change |
|---------|------|--------|
| v1 | 2026-03-19 | Initial rubric -- 5 essential, 3 recommended, 2 aspirational |
| v2 | 2026-03-19 | Added C-11..C-14 from R1 excellence signals (V-04: interrogative obligation, anti-placeholder recovery, empty-tier acknowledgment; V-05: inertia guard on PROCEED) |
| v3 | 2026-03-19 | Added C-15..C-16 from R2 excellence signals (V-05: dual-domain obligation preamble, template-label checkability); aspirational ceiling 30 -> 40, total ceiling 120 -> 130 |

**Key decisions:**

- **C-15 pass condition requires both obligations** — a preamble covering only one is PARTIAL. The value is the dual-frame, not individual coverage which C-12 and C-13 already score.
- **C-16 is anchored to C-14** — the minimum bar is the two inertia tokens since those already exist in V-03/V-05. Other gates benefit from the same pattern but the criterion doesn't fail if those other gates aren't present.
- **C-09 remains the open gap** — no R2 variation addressed the depth mode source threshold. That's the target for V-06.
