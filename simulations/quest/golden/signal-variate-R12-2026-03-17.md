# Quest Variate -- /signal (Round 12)

**Skill**: `signal` -- command index showing all 12 namespaces with sub-skills and one-line
descriptions.
**Rubric**: `simulations/quest/rubrics/signal-rubric-v12-2026-03-17.md`

## Context: what informed this round

R11 confirmed the independence of C-34 (FULL gate format check exists) and C-35 (BARE gate
order check exists). Under v11, R11 V-04 and V-05 both scored 100.00. The v12 rubric adds
three new criteria derived from R11 signals:

- **C-36** (R axis): Prompt includes a named COMPLIANCE GATE COVERAGE MATRIX (check types x
  modes). Same named-table elevation as C-15 (widths) and C-32 (domain nouns). Makes gate
  completeness a first-class prompt artifact, not an implicit property of the individual gate
  sections.
- **C-37** (S axis): FULL gate Check 4 must embed SECTION FORMAT sub-elements verbatim inline
  (header pattern, `->` separator, footer pattern) -- not reference the spec by name. A
  name-reference requires cross-prompt recall; verbatim embed is self-contained.
- **C-38** (T axis): BARE gate Check 3 must use positional line-range notation ("first 8 lines
  are scout-* names, next 4 are draft-* names...") for all 12 namespace groups. Name-list
  notation for headerless output requires correlating names to namespaces; line-range notation
  requires only positional counting.

**R11 retroactive under v12:** V-04/V-05 score 99.33. C-37 and C-38 are already satisfied
(their Check 4 embeds sub-elements verbatim; their Check 3 uses line-range groupings). C-36
is absent from all R11 prompts -- it is the sole new target for R12 isolation.

**R12 isolation plan:** V-01=R, V-02=S, V-03=T (single-axis); V-04=R+S, V-05=R+T
(dual-axis). V-06=R+S+T (convergence, not generated here) should saturate v12 at 100.00
if all three axes are independent.

The R12 control baseline (implicit V-00) carries C-01..C-35 with Check 4 in FULL referencing
SECTION FORMAT by name (C-37 FAIL) and Check 3 in BARE using a name-group list (C-38 FAIL),
and no coverage matrix (C-36 FAIL). This scores 27/30 => 9.00 => 99.00 under v12.

### Predicted scores under v12

| Variation | C-36 | C-37 | C-38 | Asp (30) | Predicted |
|-----------|------|------|------|----------|-----------|
| **V-01** (R only) | PASS | FAIL | FAIL | 28/30 -> 9.33 | **99.33** |
| **V-02** (S only) | FAIL | PASS | FAIL | 28/30 -> 9.33 | **99.33** |
| **V-03** (T only) | FAIL | FAIL | PASS | 28/30 -> 9.33 | **99.33** |
| **V-04** (R+S)    | PASS | PASS | FAIL | 29/30 -> 9.67 | **99.67** |
| **V-05** (R+T)    | PASS | FAIL | PASS | 29/30 -> 9.67 | **99.67** |

Independence check: V-04 - V-01 = +0.33 (S added); V-04 - V-02 = +0.33 (R added);
V-05 - V-01 = +0.33 (T added); V-05 - V-03 = +0.33 (R added). All deltas must equal
exactly +0.33 to confirm axis independence.

---

## V-01 -- Single-axis: coverage matrix only (Axis R, no S, no T)

**Axis**: R only (C-36). Adds COMPLIANCE GATE COVERAGE MATRIX. FULL gate Check 4 references
SECTION FORMAT by name (C-37 absent). BARE gate Check 3 uses namespace-group name-list
notation (C-38 absent).
**Hypothesis**: R alone adds +0.33 over the control baseline. Coverage matrix is the sole
structural addition. Predicted 28/30 = 99.33.

PARSE MODE:
  /signal              -> FULL (all 12 namespaces)
  /signal --bare       -> BARE (command names only, one per line, no prose)
  /signal <namespace>  -> FILTER if <namespace> is a canonical namespace; FULL otherwise
  anything else        -> FULL

Canonical namespaces (exactly these 12): scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove,
listen, program, topic, quest, mock, org.
If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.
Examples: /signal review-code -> FULL (sub-skill name is not a canonical namespace)
          /signal feature      -> FULL (arbitrary string is not a canonical namespace)

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

Per-section count self-check: before emitting the dispatch footer for each namespace
section, verify: the number of sub-skill lines above the footer equals the canonical
count for that namespace (scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9,
listen=3, program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4) AND equals the N stated in the
section header. If either count differs, restart the section from its header.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE (precomputed -- do not recount)

  namespace  longest command name        width  example pad
  ---------  -------------------------  -----  -----------
  scout      /scout-stakeholders           19   /scout-naming (13) needs 7 spaces
  draft      /draft-brainstorm             17   /draft-spec (11) needs 7 spaces
  review     /review-customers             17   /review-code (12) needs 6 spaces

  program    /prove-program                14   /program-plan (13) needs 2 spaces
  topic      /topic-status                 13   /topic-new (10) needs 4 spaces
  quest      /quest-variate                14   /quest-score (12) needs 3 spaces
  mock       /mock-review                  12   /mock-all (9) needs 4 spaces
  org        /org-committee                14   /org-roles (10) needs 5 spaces

DOMAIN NOUN TABLE

Replace <DOMAIN-NOUN> in each footer with the exact noun listed here.
Do not use a generic placeholder. Do not omit the noun.

  scout    -> research goal
  draft    -> draft artifact
  review   -> artifact
  flow     -> process scenario
  trace    -> system
  prove    -> hypothesis
  listen   -> feature
  program  -> program
  topic    -> topic management need
  quest    -> optimization goal
  mock     -> coverage gap
  org      -> organizational need

COMPLIANCE GATE COVERAGE MATRIX

Maps which gate check covers which quality dimension in each output mode.
Consult this table before emitting output to confirm all dimensions are gated.

  Dimension                         | FULL     | BARE     | FILTER
  ----------------------------------|----------|----------|--------
  No cross-namespace contamination  | N/A      | N/A      | Check 1
  All required namespaces present   | Check 1  | Check 2  | Check 2
  Canonical sub-skill count         | Check 2  | Check 2  | Check 2
  Canonical emit order              | Check 3  | Check 3  | N/A
  Section format compliance         | Check 4  | Check 1  | Check 3

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE

Before emitting FULL output, run all four checks:
  Check 1 (completeness): Does your output include sections for all 12 canonical
    namespaces: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic,
    quest, mock, org?
    If any namespace is absent -- MODE: FULL is incomplete. Restart.
  Check 2 (count): Does each namespace section contain exactly the canonical number
    of sub-skills?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If any section's count differs -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are namespace sections emitted in canonical order?
    Canonical order: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program,
    topic, quest, mock, org. (First section: scout. Last section: org.)
    If any section appears out of canonical sequence -- order violated. Restart.
  Check 4 (format): Does each namespace section follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Each section must conform to the SECTION FORMAT template above.
    If any section is missing a required element or has a malformed element --
    FULL format violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are names emitted in canonical namespace group order?
    Canonical order: scout-*, draft-*, review-*, flow-*, trace-*, prove-*, listen-*,
    program entries, topic-*, quest-*, mock-*, org-*.
    If any namespace group appears before its canonical position -- BARE order violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (scope): Does your output include any command from a namespace other than
    the one requested?
    If yes -- MODE: FILTER scope is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly the canonical count of skills
    for the requested namespace?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated in the filter output. Restart.
  Check 3 (format): Does the filter output follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Required elements: (1) a header line in the form "- /<namespace> -- <purpose> --
    <N> skills", (2) sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator, (3) a dispatch
    footer in the form "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>...".
    If any required element is absent or malformed -- FILTER output format violated. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee.

Slash-strip transformation: catalog entries carry a leading `/`. Strip it.
  `/scout-competitors` becomes `scout-competitors`  (first entry)
  `/org-committee`     becomes `org-committee`      (last entry)
Remove only the leading `/`. No other characters change.
```

## V-02 -- Single-axis: verbatim FULL gate format check only (Axis S, no R, no T)

**Axis**: S only (C-37). FULL gate Check 4 embeds SECTION FORMAT sub-elements verbatim
inline. No coverage matrix (C-36 absent). BARE gate Check 3 uses namespace-group name-list
notation (C-38 absent).
**Hypothesis**: S alone adds +0.33 over the control baseline. Verbatim embed in Check 4 is
the sole addition over a name-reference Check 4. Predicted 28/30 = 99.33.

PARSE MODE:
  /signal              -> FULL (all 12 namespaces)
  /signal --bare       -> BARE (command names only, one per line, no prose)
  /signal <namespace>  -> FILTER if <namespace> is a canonical namespace; FULL otherwise
  anything else        -> FULL

Canonical namespaces (exactly these 12): scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove,
listen, program, topic, quest, mock, org.
If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.
Examples: /signal review-code -> FULL (sub-skill name is not a canonical namespace)
          /signal feature      -> FULL (arbitrary string is not a canonical namespace)

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

Per-section count self-check: before emitting the dispatch footer for each namespace
section, verify: the number of sub-skill lines above the footer equals the canonical
count for that namespace (scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9,
listen=3, program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4) AND equals the N stated in the
section header. If either count differs, restart the section from its header.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.

DOMAIN NOUN TABLE

Replace <DOMAIN-NOUN> in each footer with the exact noun listed here.
Do not use a generic placeholder. Do not omit the noun.

  scout    -> research goal
  draft    -> draft artifact
  review   -> artifact
  flow     -> process scenario
  trace    -> system
  prove    -> hypothesis
  listen   -> feature
  program  -> program
  topic    -> topic management need
  quest    -> optimization goal
  mock     -> coverage gap
  org      -> organizational need

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE

Before emitting FULL output, run all four checks:
  Check 1 (completeness): Does your output include sections for all 12 canonical
    namespaces: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic,
    quest, mock, org?
    If any namespace is absent -- MODE: FULL is incomplete. Restart.
  Check 2 (count): Does each namespace section contain exactly the canonical number
    of sub-skills?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If any section's count differs -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are namespace sections emitted in canonical order?
    Canonical order: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program,
    topic, quest, mock, org. (First section: scout. Last section: org.)
    If any section appears out of canonical sequence -- order violated. Restart.
  Check 4 (format): Does each namespace section follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Required per section: (1) a header line in the form "- /<namespace> -- <purpose> --
    <N> skills", (2) sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator, (3) a dispatch
    footer in the form "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>...".
    If any section is missing a required element or has a malformed element --
    FULL format violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are names emitted in canonical namespace group order?
    Canonical order: scout-*, draft-*, review-*, flow-*, trace-*, prove-*, listen-*,
    program entries, topic-*, quest-*, mock-*, org-*.
    If any namespace group appears before its canonical position -- BARE order violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (scope): Does your output include any command from a namespace other than
    the one requested?
    If yes -- MODE: FILTER scope is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly the canonical count of skills
    for the requested namespace?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated in the filter output. Restart.
  Check 3 (format): Does the filter output follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Required elements: (1) a header line in the form "- /<namespace> -- <purpose> --
    <N> skills", (2) sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator, (3) a dispatch
    footer in the form "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>...".
    If any required element is absent or malformed -- FILTER output format violated. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee.

Slash-strip transformation: catalog entries carry a leading `/`. Strip it.
  `/scout-competitors` becomes `scout-competitors`  (first entry)
  `/org-committee`     becomes `org-committee`      (last entry)
Remove only the leading `/`. No other characters change.
```

## V-03 -- Single-axis: line-range BARE gate order check only (Axis T, no R, no S)

**Axis**: T only (C-38). BARE gate Check 3 uses positional line-range notation for all 12
namespace groups. No coverage matrix (C-36 absent). FULL gate Check 4 references SECTION
FORMAT by name (C-37 absent).
**Hypothesis**: T alone adds +0.33 over the control baseline. Line-range notation in BARE
Check 3 is the sole addition over a name-group list. Predicted 28/30 = 99.33.

```
The user wants the Signal command index. Show them what is available so they can find the right skill.

NAMESPACE CATALOG -- TRANSCRIPTION GATE
Before transcribing: confirm you have read all 61 entries across the 12 namespace
sections below (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61). You will emit each entry
character-for-character. The catalog below IS the output for FULL and FILTER modes.

PARSE MODE:
  /signal              -> FULL (all 12 namespaces)
  /signal --bare       -> BARE (command names only, one per line, no prose)
  /signal <namespace>  -> FILTER if <namespace> is a canonical namespace; FULL otherwise
  anything else        -> FULL

Canonical namespaces (exactly these 12): scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove,
listen, program, topic, quest, mock, org.
If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.
Examples: /signal review-code -> FULL (sub-skill name is not a canonical namespace)
          /signal feature      -> FULL (arbitrary string is not a canonical namespace)

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

Per-section count self-check: before emitting the dispatch footer for each namespace
section, verify: the number of sub-skill lines above the footer equals the canonical
count for that namespace (scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9,
listen=3, program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4) AND equals the N stated in the
section header. If either count differs, restart the section from its header.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

/org-committee  -> committee meeting simulation for ROB, shiproom, or architecture board

Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your organizational need and the most relevant skill will run.

PARSE MODE:
  /signal              -> FULL (all 12 namespaces)
  /signal --bare       -> BARE (command names only, one per line, no prose)
  /signal <namespace>  -> FILTER if <namespace> is a canonical namespace; FULL otherwise
  anything else        -> FULL

Canonical namespaces (exactly these 12): scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove,
listen, program, topic, quest, mock, org.
If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.
Examples: /signal review-code -> FULL (sub-skill name is not a canonical namespace)
          /signal feature      -> FULL (arbitrary string is not a canonical namespace)

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

Per-section count self-check: before emitting the dispatch footer for each namespace
section, verify: the number of sub-skill lines above the footer equals the canonical
count for that namespace (scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9,
listen=3, program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4) AND equals the N stated in the
section header. If either count differs, restart the section from its header.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE (precomputed -- do not recount)

  namespace  longest command name        width  example pad

DOMAIN NOUN TABLE

Replace <DOMAIN-NOUN> in each footer with the exact noun listed here.
Do not use a generic placeholder. Do not omit the noun.

  scout    -> research goal
  draft    -> draft artifact
  review   -> artifact
  flow     -> process scenario
  trace    -> system
  prove    -> hypothesis
  listen   -> feature
  program  -> program
  topic    -> topic management need
  quest    -> optimization goal
  mock     -> coverage gap
  org      -> organizational need

COMPLIANCE GATE COVERAGE MATRIX

Maps which gate check covers which quality dimension in each output mode.
Consult this table before emitting output to confirm all dimensions are gated.

  Dimension                         | FULL     | BARE     | FILTER
  ----------------------------------|----------|----------|--------
  No cross-namespace contamination  | N/A      | N/A      | Check 1
  All required namespaces present   | Check 1  | Check 2  | Check 2
  Canonical sub-skill count         | Check 2  | Check 2  | Check 2
  Canonical emit order              | Check 3  | Check 3  | N/A
  Section format compliance         | Check 4  | Check 1  | Check 3

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE

Before emitting FULL output, run all four checks:
  Check 1 (completeness): Does your output include sections for all 12 canonical
    namespaces: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic,
    quest, mock, org?
    If any namespace is absent -- MODE: FULL is incomplete. Restart.
  Check 2 (count): Does each namespace section contain exactly the canonical number
    of sub-skills?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If any section's count differs -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are namespace sections emitted in canonical order?
    Canonical order: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program,
    topic, quest, mock, org. (First section: scout. Last section: org.)
    If any section appears out of canonical sequence -- order violated. Restart.
  Check 4 (format): Does each namespace section follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Required per section: (1) a header line in the form "- /<namespace> -- <purpose> --
    <N> skills", (2) sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator, (3) a dispatch
    footer in the form "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>...".
    If any section is missing a required element or has a malformed element --
    FULL format violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are names emitted in canonical namespace group order?
    Canonical order: scout-*, draft-*, review-*, flow-*, trace-*, prove-*, listen-*,
    program entries, topic-*, quest-*, mock-*, org-*.
    If any namespace group appears before its canonical position -- BARE order violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (scope): Does your output include any command from a namespace other than
    the one requested?
    If yes -- MODE: FILTER scope is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly the canonical count of skills
    for the requested namespace?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated in the filter output. Restart.
  Check 3 (format): Does the filter output follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Required elements: (1) a header line in the form "- /<namespace> -- <purpose> --
    <N> skills", (2) sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator, (3) a dispatch
    footer in the form "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>...".
    If any required element is absent or malformed -- FILTER output format violated. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee.

Slash-strip transformation: catalog entries carry a leading `/`. Strip it.
  `/scout-competitors` becomes `scout-competitors`  (first entry)
  `/org-committee`     becomes `org-committee`      (last entry)
Remove only the leading `/`. No other characters change.
```

## V-05 -- Dual-axis: coverage matrix + line-range BARE gate order check (Axes R+T, no S)

**Axis**: R+T combined (C-36 + C-38). Adds COMPLIANCE GATE COVERAGE MATRIX and line-range
positional notation in BARE gate Check 3. FULL gate Check 4 references SECTION FORMAT by
name (C-37 absent).
**Hypothesis**: R+T together add +0.67 over the control baseline, +0.33 over V-01 (T added),
+0.33 over V-03 (R added). Predicted 29/30 = 99.67.

```
The user wants the Signal command index. Show them what is available so they can find the right skill.

NAMESPACE CATALOG -- TRANSCRIPTION GATE
Before transcribing: confirm you have read all 61 entries across the 12 namespace
sections below (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61). You will emit each entry
character-for-character. The catalog below IS the output for FULL and FILTER modes.

  /signal <namespace>  -> FILTER if <namespace> is a canonical namespace; FULL otherwise
  anything else        -> FULL

Canonical namespaces (exactly these 12): scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove,

If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.
Examples: /signal review-code -> FULL (sub-skill name is not a canonical namespace)
          /signal feature      -> FULL (arbitrary string is not a canonical namespace)

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

Per-section count self-check: before emitting the dispatch footer for each namespace
section, verify: the number of sub-skill lines above the footer equals the canonical
count for that namespace (scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9,
listen=3, program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4) AND equals the N stated in the
section header. If either count differs, restart the section from its header.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

COMPLIANCE GATE COVERAGE MATRIX

Maps which gate check covers which quality dimension in each output mode.
Consult this table before emitting output to confirm all dimensions are gated.

  Dimension                         | FULL     | BARE     | FILTER
  ----------------------------------|----------|----------|--------

  Section format compliance         | Check 4  | Check 1  | Check 3

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE

Before emitting FULL output, run all four checks:
  Check 1 (completeness): Does your output include sections for all 12 canonical
    namespaces: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic,
    quest, mock, org?
    If any namespace is absent -- MODE: FULL is incomplete. Restart.
  Check 2 (count): Does each namespace section contain exactly the canonical number
    of sub-skills?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If any section's count differs -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are namespace sections emitted in canonical order?
    Canonical order: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program,
    topic, quest, mock, org. (First section: scout. Last section: org.)
    If any section appears out of canonical sequence -- order violated. Restart.
  Check 4 (format): Does each namespace section follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Each section must conform to the SECTION FORMAT template above.
    If any section is missing a required element or has a malformed element --
    FULL format violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are names emitted in canonical namespace group order?
    Canonical sequence: first 8 lines are scout-* names, next 4 are draft-* names,
    next 4 are review-* names, next 7 are flow-* names, next 7 are trace-* names,
    next 9 are prove-* names, next 3 are listen-* names, next 2 are program entries,
    next 6 are topic-* names, next 4 are quest-* names, next 3 are mock-* names,
    last 4 are org-* names.
    If any name appears before its namespace group's turn -- BARE order violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (scope): Does your output include any command from a namespace other than
    the one requested?
    If yes -- MODE: FILTER scope is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly the canonical count of skills
    for the requested namespace?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated in the filter output. Restart.
  Check 3 (format): Does the filter output follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Required elements: (1) a header line in the form "- /<namespace> -- <purpose> --
    <N> skills", (2) sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator, (3) a dispatch
    footer in the form "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>...".
    If any required element is absent or malformed -- FILTER output format violated. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee.

Slash-strip transformation: catalog entries carry a leading `/`. Strip it.
  `/scout-competitors` becomes `scout-competitors`  (first entry)
  `/org-committee`     becomes `org-committee`      (last entry)
Remove only the leading `/`. No other characters change.

## Axis isolation summary

| Variation | C-36 matrix | C-37 verbatim Check 4 | C-38 line-range Check 3 | Predicted |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| V-01 (R)   | PRESENT | absent (name-ref)     | absent (name-list)      | 99.33 |
| V-02 (S)   | absent  | PRESENT (verbatim)    | absent (name-list)      | 99.33 |
| V-03 (T)   | absent  | absent (name-ref)     | PRESENT (line-range)    | 99.33 |
| V-04 (R+S) | PRESENT | PRESENT (verbatim)    | absent (name-list)      | 99.67 |
| V-05 (R+T) | PRESENT | absent (name-ref)     | PRESENT (line-range)    | 99.67 |

V-06 (R+S+T, not generated here): all three PRESENT => predicted 100.00 under v12.

Independence test: each single-axis variation should score exactly +0.33 over the
control. Each dual-axis should score exactly +0.67. Any deviation breaks the independence
assumption and requires re-examining C-36/C-37/C-38 for interaction effects.
