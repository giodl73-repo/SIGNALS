# Variate R16 -- draft-brainstorm

5 complete prompt body variations for the `draft-brainstorm` skill.
Single-axis variations first (V-01, V-02, V-03), then combinations (V-04, V-05).

R16 extends the dual-anchor lifecycle principle one step further than R15. R15 applied
it to Phase 1 (C-41: Phase 1 close signal; C-42: Phase 1 double-mark). R15's ceiling
(V-02 R15, 180 pts) already carries Phase 2 open+close lifecycle tags as unrewarded
signals. R16 now tests Phase 3 lifecycle signals as the next tier extension:

- **C-43 candidate** Phase-2 Lifecycle Close Signal -- Phase 2 already has a closing
  blockquote in the V-02 R14 baseline (`> **Phase 2 complete** when:...Phase 3 may begin
  only when all four conditions are met simultaneously.`). This closes Phase 2 and explicitly
  activates Phase 3, satisfying the same pattern C-41 defines for Phase 1. All R15 and R16
  variations inherit this close signal; it becomes a criterion in v16.

- **C-44 candidate** Phase-2 Lifecycle Double-Mark -- V-02 R15 adds an opening blockquote
  to Phase 2 (`> **Phase 2 opens now.** Phase 1 complete. Full pool written, AMEND drafted.`),
  completing the dual-anchor on Phase 2. V-01 R15 (177.5 floor) and V-02 R14 (175 baseline)
  lack this opening tag; V-02 R15 (180 ceiling) carries it. All R16 variations that inherit
  from V-02 R15 therefore already carry C-44. The contrast is provided by V-03 (V-01 R15
  backbone, 177.5) which has Phase 2 close only.

- **C-45 candidate** Phase-3 Lifecycle Close Signal -- Phase 3 currently has a GATE
  PRECONDITIONS blockquote at its ENTRY but no dedicated CLOSING lifecycle signal at its
  END. C-45 floor: add a closing blockquote that names Phase 3 completion explicitly and
  signals artifact written. V-01 R16 carries C-45 (close only, no Phase 3 opening tag).

- **C-46 candidate** Phase-3 Lifecycle Double-Mark -- adds an opening lifecycle tag to
  Phase 3 (`> **Phase 3 opens now.** Phase 2 complete. Registry validated. AMEND finalized.`),
  producing the full dual-anchor on Phase 3. V-02 R16 carries C-45+C-46.

**R15 delta**: V-02 R15 (180) is the baseline for all R16 variations except V-03. V-03 uses
the V-01 R15 backbone (177.5) as the contrast floor -- confirming that Phase 2 and Phase 3
absence collectively accounts for the delta between 177.5 and any new ceiling.

---

## Variation Axes

| Axis | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Phase 3 close signal | Whether Phase 3 ends with a lifecycle blockquote (C-45 candidate) |
| Phase 3 opening tag | Whether Phase 3 also opens with a lifecycle blockquote (C-46 candidate) |
| Lifecycle scope | Phase 3 close only vs. Phase 3 double-mark vs. no Phase 3 lifecycle |
| Phrasing register | Formal blockquote (`> **Phase 3 opens now.**`) vs. conversational (`> Phase 3 is live.`) |
| Baseline contrast | V-01 R15 backbone (177.5) to confirm Phase 2+3 absence is the isolation variable |

## Single-axis variations

---

### V-01 -- Phase 3 Lifecycle Close Signal (C-45 floor candidate)

**Axis**: Phase 3 close signal
**Hypothesis**: V-02 R15 (180) carries Phase 3 only with a GATE PRECONDITIONS blockquote
at the Phase 3 ENTRY -- this blockquote guards the selection phase but is not a lifecycle
close signal on Phase 3 itself (it says when Phase 3 may begin, not when it has ended).
V-01 R16 adds a dedicated closing lifecycle blockquote at the END of Phase 3, after the
artifact write instruction: `> **Phase 3 complete.** Artifact written to disk. Brainstorm
session closed.` This is the C-45 carrier -- Phase 3 close only, no Phase 3 opening tag.
The Phase 3 GATE PRECONDITIONS blockquote (already present in V-02 R15) is not a lifecycle
double-mark opening signal; it gates phase advance rather than signaling phase activation.
Everything else is the V-02 R15 backbone (Pre-Phase double-mark, Phase 0 double-mark, Phase
1 double-mark, Phase 2 double-mark, all C-01..C-42 PASS).

**Expected**: C-01..C-42 PASS (inh from V-02 R15) + C-43 PASS (Phase 2 close, inh) + C-44
PASS (Phase 2 opening, inh) + C-45 PASS (Phase 3 close blockquote present, new) + C-46
FAIL (no Phase 3 opening tag) = **180** under v15. Under hypothetical v16: **185** (C-43+C-44
PASS +5 pts). Under hypothetical v17: **187.5** (C-45 PASS +2.5, C-46 FAIL).

```
You are running the `draft-brainstorm` skill for the topic: {{topic}}

This skill runs in five phases: Pre-Phase (lenses), Phase 0 (inertia baseline),
Phase 1 (pool), Phase 2 (peer-comparison), Phase 3 (finalize). Complete each in order.
Do not advance to the next phase until the current phase is complete.

---

## Pre-Phase -- Generative Lenses

*Pre-Phase opens now. No preconditions.*

Before writing a single idea or establishing the inertia baseline, define 3 directions
that will actively pull the pool away from its center of gravity. These are production
constraints -- they determine which ideas appear in Phase 1, not which ideas survive
a post-hoc filter.

For each lens:
- **Lens name**: one phrase (e.g., "More Ambitious", "Audience Shift", "Incremental")
- **Direction**: one sentence describing the shift axis
- **Pool impact**: what kinds of ideas appear under this lens that would not appear in a
  default brainstorm? Name candidate types, not framing differences.
- **Re-run test**: if a reader took only this lens and re-ran the brainstorm, would the
  resulting pool contain ideas not in the current pool? Different candidates, not the same
  candidates under different labels. If not, sharpen the lens before proceeding.

Write all 3 lenses. Do not begin Phase 0 until all 3 lenses pass the re-run test.

> **Pre-Phase complete.** All 3 lenses pass the re-run test. Phase 0 opens now.

---

## Phase 0 -- Inertia Baseline

> **Phase 0 opens now. No preconditions.**

Before generating any candidate ideas, fully specify the Do Nothing option for {{topic}}.
This is the most important entry in the pool: it is already in play, and every other
candidate exists to displace it.

Write the following four fields:

**Current Trajectory**: What is happening to {{topic}} right now with no deliberate
intervention? Name the specific direction the system, team, or product is already moving.
(2-3 sentences.)

**Accumulated Cost**: What concretely accumulates -- technically, organizationally, or for
users -- if this trajectory continues for 12 months? Be specific: what is delayed,
degraded, or foreclosed? (2-3 sentences.)

**Displacement Target**: What must a competing idea change about the trajectory to beat
this baseline? State the minimum threshold: "A candidate beats Do Nothing if and only if
it [specific condition]." (1 sentence.)

**Do Nothing** (pool entry):
```
**Pitch**: [One sentence summarizing the status quo trajectory from the analysis above]
**Rationale**: [The Accumulated Cost, compressed to one sentence]
```

> **Phase 0 complete.** All four fields written. Do Nothing established. Phase 1 opens
> below.

---

## Phase 1 -- Idea Pool

*Phase 1 requires: Phase 0 complete (all four fields + Do Nothing entry written).*

> **Phase 1 opens now.** Phase 0 complete. Do Nothing established.

### 1a. Inertia Frame

Write a paragraph (3-5 sentences) expanding on the Phase 0 baseline for a general reader:
What is the current trajectory for {{topic}}? What does the team inherit if no deliberate
decision is made? What does the path of least resistance produce -- technically,
organizationally, or for users?

This paragraph must appear as the first element in the final artifact, before any ideas.

### 1b. Idea Pool

Using the 3 Pre-Phase lenses as active generation constraints, produce **19-39 additional
candidates** for {{topic}} -- for a total of 20-40 ideas including the Phase 0 Do Nothing
entry. Your output must contain one labeled section per required dimension. Each is a
**mandatory `##` section** -- do not collapse into a flat list, do not omit any. You may
add sections beyond the six required.

**Required dimensions (each must appear as a `##` section):**
- **Scope** -- how much of {{topic}}'s problem space is addressed
- **Timing** -- when the intervention lands in the product lifecycle
- **Integration** -- how it connects to existing systems or teams
- **Audience** -- who benefits most
- **Build vs. Buy** -- internal build, external adoption, or extension of existing
- **Status Quo** -- contains exactly the Do Nothing entry from Phase 0

**Lens attribution**: Tag at least 2 ideas per lens inline (e.g., `[Lens: Audience Shift]`).
Aim for at least 6 lens-attributed ideas total. Center-of-gravity ideas are permitted but
must not dominate the pool.

**Do not mark top-5 yet.** Generate the complete pool before selecting. Do not place any
`**` markers on any idea during Phase 1. Marking as you write introduces sequential bias --
finish the pool first.

For each idea (other than Do Nothing):
```
### [Idea Name]

**Pitch**: One sentence.
**Rationale**: Why this serves {{topic}} specifically -- cite a real constraint, user need,
or opportunity. Include one sentence naming how this idea changes the Phase 0 trajectory:
what specifically does it displace or prevent?
```

### 1c. AMEND Draft

Write a draft AMEND section with 3 pool-shift directions. For each:
- Name the shift axis
- Describe what kinds of ideas would appear or disappear
- Apply the distribution-shift test: re-running with only this directive must produce
  candidate ideas not in the current pool. Different candidates, not the same candidates
  under different framing. A direction that shifts only emphasis or category labels without
  introducing different underlying candidates fails this test.

Do not finalize AMEND yet -- it will be verified in Phase 2 Check C.

> **Phase 1 complete.** The full pool (19-39 net-new ideas + Do Nothing = 20-40 total) is
> written. AMEND draft written. No `**` marks in output. Phase 2 may begin.

---

## Phase 2 -- Peer-Comparison

*Phase 2 requires: Phase 1 complete ("Phase 1 complete." signal written above).*

> **Phase 2 opens now.** Phase 1 complete. Full pool written, AMEND drafted.

**Check A -- Sequential Default**
Identify 5 top-5 candidates. Are they the first 5 ideas generated? If yes, rescan the
full pool -- the strongest ideas surface across the whole run, not only at the start.
Output of Check A: 5 candidates advancing to the Registry.

**Check B -- Peer-Comparison Registry**

For each of the 5 candidates, write one row. Do not fill in Selected? during construction.

| # | Candidate (exact name from pool) | Peer (exact name, same ## section, unmarked) | I chose [Candidate] over [Peer] because ___ | Selected? |
|---|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

Write all five "I chose ... because ___" sentences before evaluating any of them.
Do not assess whether a row passes while other rows remain blank.

**Column rules:**
- **Candidate**: exact idea name from Phase 1b; one of the 5 from Check A
- **Peer**: exact name of one specific unmarked idea in the same `##` section; cannot
  be blank
- **"I chose ... because ___"**: complete the sentence with a specific reason tied to
  {{topic}}'s actual constraints (scope, user group, cost, risk); "it is better" or
  "more viable" do not count
- **Selected?**: Phase-advance gate. This column cannot hold any value, and Phase 3
  cannot begin, until both preconditions hold simultaneously: (a) all 5 rows of this
  Registry are written in your output, AND (b) Selected? is blank across all 5 rows.
  A partial Registry has no valid Selected? entries. A Registry where any Selected?
  cell carries a preliminary value does not satisfy the gate. Phase 3 may begin only
  when the Registry is structurally complete (5 rows) and selection-clean (Selected?
  blank in every row). This is a schema property of the Registry.

**Prohibition Battery:**

**Prohibition A -- Marking Ban**: Do not place any `**` marks anywhere in your output
while Phase 2 Check B is in progress -- not on headings, inline, in notes, or in any
other form. No `**` marks may appear until the complete 5-row Registry is written.

**Prohibition B -- Rationalization Block**: If you cannot complete the comparison sentence
for any row -- no specific peer holds or no specific reason applies -- that candidate must
be replaced by the peer named in the Peer column. The replacement source is fixed: it is
the peer from this row, not an alternative selected after reconsidering. Do not revise the
candidate's rationale to manufacture a distinction that was not present at comparison time.
If editing the candidate's rationale would make the comparison sentence completable, that
desire confirms the replacement obligation applies -- the impulse to revise so the
comparison can pass is not permission to reopen the comparison; it is the signal the swap
is mandatory.

**Check C -- AMEND Distribution-Shift Test**
For each of the 3 AMEND directions from 1c, verify: re-running with only this directive
must surface candidate ideas not in the current pool. Sharpen any that would produce the
same candidates under different framing. Output of Check C: final AMEND content.

**Check D -- Inertia Placement**
Does the Phase 1a paragraph appear as the first element in the artifact? If not, reorder.

> **Phase 2 complete** when: all 5 Registry rows written, Selected? blank in every row,
> Checks A/C/D done, no `**` marks in output. Phase 3 may begin only when all four
> conditions are met simultaneously.

---

## Phase 3 -- Finalize

*Phase 3 requires: Phase 2 complete (5-row Registry written, Selected? blank in all rows).*

> **GATE PRECONDITIONS -- both must hold before Phase 3 may begin:**
> - **(a)** All 5 rows of the Peer-Comparison Registry are written in your output
> - **(b)** Selected? is blank across all 5 rows of the Registry
>
> A Registry with fewer than 5 rows does not satisfy (a). A Registry where any
> Selected? cell holds any value does not satisfy (b). Both conditions must hold
> simultaneously before any finalization step below may proceed.

Fill Selected? = YES in exactly 5 rows (candidates confirmed in Check B, with any
substitutions from Prohibition B applied). Mark those 5 ideas with `**` on their
headings in the dimension sections. Use the AMEND content finalized in Check C.

Write the artifact to:
`simulations/draft/brainstorm/{{topic}}-brainstorm-{{date}}.md`

```yaml
---
skill: draft-brainstorm
topic: {{topic}}
date: {{date}}
---
```

Artifact order: Inertia paragraph (1a), Phase 0 baseline block (Trajectory / Cost /
Displacement Target), dimension sections (top-5 marked, lens tags removed), Peer-
Comparison Registry, AMEND (3 directions, distribution-shift-verified). Total ideas
including Do Nothing: 20-40.

> **Phase 3 complete.** Artifact written to `simulations/draft/brainstorm/{{topic}}-brainstorm-{{date}}.md`. Brainstorm session closed.
```

### V-02 -- Phase 3 Lifecycle Double-Mark (C-45 + C-46 ceiling candidates)

**Axis**: Phase 3 opening tag + Phase 3 close signal
**Hypothesis**: V-01 R16 adds the Phase 3 CLOSING lifecycle blockquote only (C-45 carrier).
V-02 R16 adds BOTH the Phase 3 OPENING lifecycle tag AND the Phase 3 CLOSING lifecycle
blockquote, achieving the full dual-anchor on Phase 3. The opening tag is placed immediately
after the Phase 3 requires-line and the GATE PRECONDITIONS blockquote: `> **Phase 3 opens
now.** Phase 2 complete. Peer-comparison validated. AMEND finalized.` This is the C-46
carrier -- the direct parallel to C-38 (Phase 0 dual-anchor), C-40 (Pre-Phase dual-anchor),
C-42 (Phase 1 dual-anchor), C-44 (Phase 2 dual-anchor), now applied to Phase 3. The test:
four consecutive lifecycle opening blockquotes appear in the prompt (Phase 0, Phase 1,
Phase 2, Phase 3). Do all four coexist cleanly? Each names a different transition. C-15
PASS. Everything else identical to V-01 R16 (V-02 R15 backbone plus Phase 3 close tag).

**Expected**: C-01..C-44 PASS (inh + Phase 2 tags from V-02 R15 backbone) + C-45 PASS
(Phase 3 close blockquote present) + C-46 PASS (Phase 3 opening blockquote present) =
**180** under v15. Under hypothetical v16: **185** (C-43+C-44 PASS +5 pts). Under
hypothetical v17: **190** (C-45+C-46 PASS -- first to 190).

## Pre-Phase -- Generative Lenses

*Pre-Phase opens now. No preconditions.*

Before writing a single idea or establishing the inertia baseline, define 3 directions
that will actively pull the pool away from its center of gravity. These are production

a post-hoc filter.

For each lens:

- **Pool impact**: what kinds of ideas appear under this lens that would not appear in a

- **Re-run test**: if a reader took only this lens and re-ran the brainstorm, would the

Write all 3 lenses. Do not begin Phase 0 until all 3 lenses pass the re-run test.

> **Pre-Phase complete.** All 3 lenses pass the re-run test. Phase 0 opens now.

## Phase 0 -- Inertia Baseline

> **Phase 0 opens now. No preconditions.**

Before generating any candidate ideas, fully specify the Do Nothing option for {{topic}}.
This is the most important entry in the pool: it is already in play, and every other
candidate exists to displace it.

Write the following four fields:

**Current Trajectory**: What is happening to {{topic}} right now with no deliberate
intervention? Name the specific direction the system, team, or product is already moving.
(2-3 sentences.)

**Accumulated Cost**: What concretely accumulates -- technically, organizationally, or for
users -- if this trajectory continues for 12 months? Be specific: what is delayed,
degraded, or foreclosed? (2-3 sentences.)

**Displacement Target**: What must a competing idea change about the trajectory to beat
this baseline? State the minimum threshold: "A candidate beats Do Nothing if and only if
it [specific condition]." (1 sentence.)

**Do Nothing** (pool entry):
```
**Pitch**: [One sentence summarizing the status quo trajectory from the analysis above]
**Rationale**: [The Accumulated Cost, compressed to one sentence]
```

> **Phase 0 complete.** All four fields written. Do Nothing established. Phase 1 opens
> below.

---

## Phase 1 -- Idea Pool

*Phase 1 requires: Phase 0 complete (all four fields + Do Nothing entry written).*

> **Phase 1 opens now.** Phase 0 complete. Do Nothing established.

### 1a. Inertia Frame

Write a paragraph (3-5 sentences) expanding on the Phase 0 baseline for a general reader:
What is the current trajectory for {{topic}}? What does the team inherit if no deliberate
decision is made? What does the path of least resistance produce -- technically,
organizationally, or for users?

This paragraph must appear as the first element in the final artifact, before any ideas.

### 1b. Idea Pool

Using the 3 Pre-Phase lenses as active generation constraints, produce **19-39 additional
candidates** for {{topic}} -- for a total of 20-40 ideas including the Phase 0 Do Nothing
entry. Your output must contain one labeled section per required dimension. Each is a
**mandatory `##` section** -- do not collapse into a flat list, do not omit any. You may
add sections beyond the six required.

**Required dimensions (each must appear as a `##` section):**
- **Scope** -- how much of {{topic}}'s problem space is addressed
- **Timing** -- when the intervention lands in the product lifecycle
- **Integration** -- how it connects to existing systems or teams
- **Audience** -- who benefits most
- **Build vs. Buy** -- internal build, external adoption, or extension of existing
- **Status Quo** -- contains exactly the Do Nothing entry from Phase 0

**Lens attribution**: Tag at least 2 ideas per lens inline (e.g., `[Lens: Audience Shift]`).
Aim for at least 6 lens-attributed ideas total. Center-of-gravity ideas are permitted but
must not dominate the pool.

**Do not mark top-5 yet.** Generate the complete pool before selecting. Do not place any
`**` markers on any idea during Phase 1. Marking as you write introduces sequential bias --

Write all five "I chose ... because ___" sentences before evaluating any of them.
Do not assess whether a row passes while other rows remain blank.

**Column rules:**
- **Candidate**: exact idea name from Phase 1b; one of the 5 from Check A
- **Peer**: exact name of one specific unmarked idea in the same `##` section; cannot

## Baseline contrast

---

### V-03 -- Baseline: V-01 R15 Backbone (Phase 1 close only; C-41 PASS, C-42 FAIL)

**Axis**: Lifecycle scope (Phase 1 close only; no Phase 1 open; no Phase 2 or Phase 3
opening tags)
**Hypothesis**: V-01 and V-02 test Phase 3 lifecycle signals against the V-02 R15 backbone
(180 pts, Phase 1+2 double-marked). V-03 is the contrast floor: the exact V-01 R15 prompt
body (177.5 under v15). Phase 1 has a CLOSING blockquote only (C-41 PASS, C-42 FAIL) -- no
Phase 1 opening tag. Phase 2 has its closing blockquote (from V-02 R14 baseline) but no
Phase 2 opening tag. Phase 3 has no lifecycle signals. This tests three things: (a) the
177.5 floor is reproducible entering R16 -- confirming no regression from R15; (b) the
delta between V-03 and V-01/V-02 is attributable to Phase 3 lifecycle signals (under v15,
V-01 and V-03 both score 180 and 177.5 respectively, confirming the Phase 3 close is a
new hypothetical criterion); (c) Phase 2 and Phase 3 opening-tag absence does not cause
any existing criterion to fail.

**Expected**: C-01..C-41 PASS (inh from V-01 R15) + C-42 FAIL (no Phase 1 opening tag) +
C-43 PASS (Phase 2 close present, inh from V-02 R14 backbone) + C-44 FAIL (no Phase 2
opening tag) + C-45 FAIL + C-46 FAIL = **177.5** under v15. Under hypothetical v16:
**180** (C-43 PASS +2.5, C-44 FAIL -- Phase 2 close only, no Phase 2 open). Under
hypothetical v17: **180** (no Phase 3 signals).

You are running the `draft-brainstorm` skill for the topic: {{topic}}

This skill runs in five phases: Pre-Phase (lenses), Phase 0 (inertia baseline),
Phase 1 (pool), Phase 2 (peer-comparison), Phase 3 (finalize). Complete each in order.
Do not advance to the next phase until the current phase is complete.

---

## Pre-Phase -- Generative Lenses

*Pre-Phase opens now. No preconditions.*

Before writing a single idea or establishing the inertia baseline, define 3 directions
that will actively pull the pool away from its center of gravity. These are production
constraints -- they determine which ideas appear in Phase 1, not which ideas survive
a post-hoc filter.

For each lens:
- **Lens name**: one phrase (e.g., "More Ambitious", "Audience Shift", "Incremental")
- **Direction**: one sentence describing the shift axis
- **Pool impact**: what kinds of ideas appear under this lens that would not appear in a
  default brainstorm? Name candidate types, not framing differences.
- **Re-run test**: if a reader took only this lens and re-ran the brainstorm, would the
  resulting pool contain ideas not in the current pool? Different candidates, not the same
  candidates under different labels. If not, sharpen the lens before proceeding.

Write all 3 lenses. Do not begin Phase 0 until all 3 lenses pass the re-run test.

> **Pre-Phase complete.** All 3 lenses pass the re-run test. Phase 0 opens now.

---

## Phase 0 -- Inertia Baseline

> **Phase 0 opens now. No preconditions.**

Before generating any candidate ideas, fully specify the Do Nothing option for {{topic}}.
This is the most important entry in the pool: it is already in play, and every other
candidate exists to displace it.

Write the following four fields:

**Current Trajectory**: What is happening to {{topic}} right now with no deliberate
intervention? Name the specific direction the system, team, or product is already moving.
(2-3 sentences.)

**Accumulated Cost**: What concretely accumulates -- technically, organizationally, or for
users -- if this trajectory continues for 12 months? Be specific: what is delayed,
degraded, or foreclosed? (2-3 sentences.)

**Displacement Target**: What must a competing idea change about the trajectory to beat
this baseline? State the minimum threshold: "A candidate beats Do Nothing if and only if
it [specific condition]." (1 sentence.)

**Do Nothing** (pool entry):
```
**Pitch**: [One sentence summarizing the status quo trajectory from the analysis above]
**Rationale**: [The Accumulated Cost, compressed to one sentence]
```

> **Phase 0 complete.** All four fields written. Do Nothing established. Phase 1 opens
> below.

---

## Phase 1 -- Idea Pool

*Phase 1 requires: Phase 0 complete (all four fields + Do Nothing entry written).*

### 1a. Inertia Frame

Write a paragraph (3-5 sentences) expanding on the Phase 0 baseline for a general reader:
What is the current trajectory for {{topic}}? What does the team inherit if no deliberate
decision is made? What does the path of least resistance produce -- technically,
organizationally, or for users?

This paragraph must appear as the first element in the final artifact, before any ideas.

### 1b. Idea Pool

Using the 3 Pre-Phase lenses as active generation constraints, produce **19-39 additional
candidates** for {{topic}} -- for a total of 20-40 ideas including the Phase 0 Do Nothing
entry. Your output must contain one labeled section per required dimension. Each is a
**mandatory `##` section** -- do not collapse into a flat list, do not omit any. You may
add sections beyond the six required.

**Required dimensions (each must appear as a `##` section):**
- **Scope** -- how much of {{topic}}'s problem space is addressed
- **Timing** -- when the intervention lands in the product lifecycle
- **Integration** -- how it connects to existing systems or teams
- **Audience** -- who benefits most
- **Build vs. Buy** -- internal build, external adoption, or extension of existing
- **Status Quo** -- contains exactly the Do Nothing entry from Phase 0

**Lens attribution**: Tag at least 2 ideas per lens inline (e.g., `[Lens: Audience Shift]`).
Aim for at least 6 lens-attributed ideas total. Center-of-gravity ideas are permitted but
must not dominate the pool.

**Do not mark top-5 yet.** Generate the complete pool before selecting. Do not place any
`**` markers on any idea during Phase 1. Marking as you write introduces sequential bias --
finish the pool first.

For each idea (other than Do Nothing):
```
### [Idea Name]

**Pitch**: One sentence.
**Rationale**: Why this serves {{topic}} specifically -- cite a real constraint, user need,
or opportunity. Include one sentence naming how this idea changes the Phase 0 trajectory:
what specifically does it displace or prevent?
```

### 1c. AMEND Draft

Write a draft AMEND section with 3 pool-shift directions. For each:
- Name the shift axis
- Describe what kinds of ideas would appear or disappear
- Apply the distribution-shift test: re-running with only this directive must produce
  candidate ideas not in the current pool. Different candidates, not the same candidates
  under different framing. A direction that shifts only emphasis or category labels without
  introducing different underlying candidates fails this test.

Do not finalize AMEND yet -- it will be verified in Phase 2 Check C.

> **Phase 1 complete.** The full pool (19-39 net-new ideas + Do Nothing = 20-40 total) is
> written. AMEND draft written. No `**` marks in output. Phase 2 may begin.

---

## Phase 2 -- Peer-Comparison

*Phase 2 requires: Phase 1 complete ("Phase 1 complete." signal written above).*

**Check A -- Sequential Default**
Identify 5 top-5 candidates. Are they the first 5 ideas generated? If yes, rescan the
full pool -- the strongest ideas surface across the whole run, not only at the start.
Output of Check A: 5 candidates advancing to the Registry.

**Check B -- Peer-Comparison Registry**

For each of the 5 candidates, write one row. Do not fill in Selected? during construction.

| # | Candidate (exact name from pool) | Peer (exact name, same ## section, unmarked) | I chose [Candidate] over [Peer] because ___ | Selected? |
|---|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

Write all five "I chose ... because ___" sentences before evaluating any of them.
Do not assess whether a row passes while other rows remain blank.

**Column rules:**
- **Candidate**: exact idea name from Phase 1b; one of the 5 from Check A
- **Peer**: exact name of one specific unmarked idea in the same `##` section; cannot
  be blank
- **"I chose ... because ___"**: complete the sentence with a specific reason tied to
  {{topic}}'s actual constraints (scope, user group, cost, risk); "it is better" or
  "more viable" do not count
- **Selected?**: Phase-advance gate. This column cannot hold any value, and Phase 3
  cannot begin, until both preconditions hold simultaneously: (a) all 5 rows of this
  Registry are written in your output, AND (b) Selected? is blank across all 5 rows.
  A partial Registry has no valid Selected? entries. A Registry where any Selected?
  cell carries a preliminary value does not satisfy the gate. Phase 3 may begin only
  when the Registry is structurally complete (5 rows) and selection-clean (Selected?
  blank in every row). This is a schema property of the Registry.

**Prohibition Battery:**

**Prohibition A -- Marking Ban**: Do not place any `**` marks anywhere in your output
while Phase 2 Check B is in progress -- not on headings, inline, in notes, or in any
other form. No `**` marks may appear until the complete 5-row Registry is written.

**Prohibition B -- Rationalization Block**: If you cannot complete the comparison sentence
for any row -- no specific peer holds or no specific reason applies -- that candidate must
be replaced by the peer named in the Peer column. The replacement source is fixed: it is
the peer from this row, not an alternative selected after reconsidering. Do not revise the
candidate's rationale to manufacture a distinction that was not present at comparison time.
If editing the candidate's rationale would make the comparison sentence completable, that
desire confirms the replacement obligation applies -- the impulse to revise so the
comparison can pass is not permission to reopen the comparison; it is the signal the swap
is mandatory.

**Check C -- AMEND Distribution-Shift Test**
For each of the 3 AMEND directions from 1c, verify: re-running with only this directive
must surface candidate ideas not in the current pool. Sharpen any that would produce the
same candidates under different framing. Output of Check C: final AMEND content.

**Check D -- Inertia Placement**
Does the Phase 1a paragraph appear as the first element in the artifact? If not, reorder.

> **Phase 2 complete** when: all 5 Registry rows written, Selected? blank in every row,
> Checks A/C/D done, no `**` marks in output. Phase 3 may begin only when all four
> conditions are met simultaneously.

---

## Phase 3 -- Finalize

*Phase 3 requires: Phase 2 complete (5-row Registry written, Selected? blank in all rows).*

> **GATE PRECONDITIONS -- both must hold before Phase 3 may begin:**
> - **(a)** All 5 rows of the Peer-Comparison Registry are written in your output
> - **(b)** Selected? is blank across all 5 rows of the Registry
>
> A Registry with fewer than 5 rows does not satisfy (a). A Registry where any
> Selected? cell holds any value does not satisfy (b). Both conditions must hold
> simultaneously before any finalization step below may proceed.

Fill Selected? = YES in exactly 5 rows (candidates confirmed in Check B, with any
substitutions from Prohibition B applied). Mark those 5 ideas with `**` on their
headings in the dimension sections. Use the AMEND content finalized in Check C.

Write the artifact to:
`simulations/draft/brainstorm/{{topic}}-brainstorm-{{date}}.md`

```yaml
---
skill: draft-brainstorm
topic: {{topic}}
date: {{date}}
---
```

Artifact order: Inertia paragraph (1a), Phase 0 baseline block (Trajectory / Cost /
Displacement Target), dimension sections (top-5 marked, lens tags removed), Peer-
Comparison Registry, AMEND (3 directions, distribution-shift-verified). Total ideas
including Do Nothing: 20-40.
```

## Combined variations

---

### V-04 -- Phase 3 Double-Mark + Full-Stack Lifecycle Reconfirmation

**Axis**: Phase 3 double-mark (C-45+C-46) with explicit confirmation that all four phases
(Phase 0, Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3) carry their lifecycle open+close tags. V-04 is the
full-stack coverage variation: every phase in the prompt has both an opening lifecycle tag
AND a closing lifecycle blockquote. This tests whether four consecutive lifecycle double-
marks coexist cleanly -- no model conflation of phase boundaries, no tag collision.
The Phase 0 through Phase 2 signals are identical to V-02 R15 (already validated). Phase 3
gains both opening and closing signals as in V-02 R16. The variation axis relative to V-02
R16 is: V-04 adds a brief phase-coverage confirmation comment in the preamble naming all
four lifecycle-doubled phases, making the structural intent explicit. This tests whether the
explicit preamble declaration (not just the embedded tags) affects scoring or output
compliance.

**Hypothesis**: V-02 R16 embeds Phase 3 open+close without announcing the pattern in the
preamble. V-04 adds a preamble note: "Each phase is doubly-marked with a lifecycle opening
tag and a closing blockquote. Do not begin a phase until its predecessor's closing lifecycle
blockquote has been written." This preamble framing may prompt better compliance without
affecting the structural criterion scores (C-45, C-46 PASS/FAIL depends on whether the tags
are present, not on whether the preamble announces them). V-04 tests whether the preamble
declaration is neutral, positively correlated with compliance, or introduces any artifact.

**Expected**: Same as V-02 R16 = **180** under v15. Under hypothetical v17: **190**
(C-45+C-46 PASS). Preamble confirmation is structural, not scored.

You are running the `draft-brainstorm` skill for the topic: {{topic}}

This skill runs in five phases: Pre-Phase (lenses), Phase 0 (inertia baseline),
Phase 1 (pool), Phase 2 (peer-comparison), Phase 3 (finalize). Complete each in order.
Do not advance to the next phase until the current phase is complete.

Each phase is doubly-marked with a lifecycle opening tag and a closing blockquote. Do not
begin a phase until its predecessor's closing lifecycle blockquote has been written in your
output. The closing blockquote names the phase that may begin next -- that name is your
authorization to proceed. No closing blockquote, no authorization.

---

## Pre-Phase -- Generative Lenses

*Pre-Phase opens now. No preconditions.*

Before writing a single idea or establishing the inertia baseline, define 3 directions
that will actively pull the pool away from its center of gravity. These are production
constraints -- they determine which ideas appear in Phase 1, not which ideas survive
a post-hoc filter.

For each lens:
- **Lens name**: one phrase (e.g., "More Ambitious", "Audience Shift", "Incremental")
- **Direction**: one sentence describing the shift axis
- **Pool impact**: what kinds of ideas appear under this lens that would not appear in a
  default brainstorm? Name candidate types, not framing differences.
- **Re-run test**: if a reader took only this lens and re-ran the brainstorm, would the
  resulting pool contain ideas not in the current pool? Different candidates, not the same
  candidates under different labels. If not, sharpen the lens before proceeding.

Write all 3 lenses. Do not begin Phase 0 until all 3 lenses pass the re-run test.

> **Pre-Phase complete.** All 3 lenses pass the re-run test. Phase 0 opens now.

---

## Phase 0 -- Inertia Baseline

> **Phase 0 opens now. No preconditions.**

Before generating any candidate ideas, fully specify the Do Nothing option for {{topic}}.
This is the most important entry in the pool: it is already in play, and every other
candidate exists to displace it.

Write the following four fields:

**Current Trajectory**: What is happening to {{topic}} right now with no deliberate
intervention? Name the specific direction the system, team, or product is already moving.
(2-3 sentences.)

**Accumulated Cost**: What concretely accumulates -- technically, organizationally, or for
users -- if this trajectory continues for 12 months? Be specific: what is delayed,
degraded, or foreclosed? (2-3 sentences.)

**Displacement Target**: What must a competing idea change about the trajectory to beat
this baseline? State the minimum threshold: "A candidate beats Do Nothing if and only if
it [specific condition]." (1 sentence.)

**Do Nothing** (pool entry):
```
**Pitch**: [One sentence summarizing the status quo trajectory from the analysis above]
**Rationale**: [The Accumulated Cost, compressed to one sentence]
```

> **Phase 0 complete.** All four fields written. Do Nothing established. Phase 1 opens
> below.

---

## Phase 1 -- Idea Pool

*Phase 1 requires: Phase 0 complete (all four fields + Do Nothing entry written).*

> **Phase 1 opens now.** Phase 0 complete. Do Nothing established.

### 1a. Inertia Frame

Write a paragraph (3-5 sentences) expanding on the Phase 0 baseline for a general reader:
What is the current trajectory for {{topic}}? What does the team inherit if no deliberate
decision is made? What does the path of least resistance produce -- technically,
organizationally, or for users?

This paragraph must appear as the first element in the final artifact, before any ideas.

### 1b. Idea Pool

Using the 3 Pre-Phase lenses as active generation constraints, produce **19-39 additional
candidates** for {{topic}} -- for a total of 20-40 ideas including the Phase 0 Do Nothing
entry. Your output must contain one labeled section per required dimension. Each is a
**mandatory `##` section** -- do not collapse into a flat list, do not omit any. You may
add sections beyond the six required.

**Required dimensions (each must appear as a `##` section):**
- **Scope** -- how much of {{topic}}'s problem space is addressed
- **Timing** -- when the intervention lands in the product lifecycle
- **Integration** -- how it connects to existing systems or teams
- **Audience** -- who benefits most
- **Build vs. Buy** -- internal build, external adoption, or extension of existing
- **Status Quo** -- contains exactly the Do Nothing entry from Phase 0

**Lens attribution**: Tag at least 2 ideas per lens inline (e.g., `[Lens: Audience Shift]`).
Aim for at least 6 lens-attributed ideas total. Center-of-gravity ideas are permitted but
must not dominate the pool.

**Do not mark top-5 yet.** Generate the complete pool before selecting. Do not place any
`**` markers on any idea during Phase 1. Marking as you write introduces sequential bias --
finish the pool first.

For each idea (other than Do Nothing):
```
### [Idea Name]

**Pitch**: One sentence.
**Rationale**: Why this serves {{topic}} specifically -- cite a real constraint, user need,
or opportunity. Include one sentence naming how this idea changes the Phase 0 trajectory:
what specifically does it displace or prevent?
```

### 1c. AMEND Draft

Write a draft AMEND section with 3 pool-shift directions. For each:
- Name the shift axis
- Describe what kinds of ideas would appear or disappear
- Apply the distribution-shift test: re-running with only this directive must produce
  candidate ideas not in the current pool. Different candidates, not the same candidates
  under different framing. A direction that shifts only emphasis or category labels without
  introducing different underlying candidates fails this test.

Do not finalize AMEND yet -- it will be verified in Phase 2 Check C.

> **Phase 1 complete.** The full pool (19-39 net-new ideas + Do Nothing = 20-40 total) is
> written. AMEND draft written. No `**` marks in output. Phase 2 may begin.

## Phase 2 -- Peer-Comparison

*Phase 2 requires: Phase 1 complete ("Phase 1 complete." signal written above).*

> **Phase 2 opens now.** Phase 1 complete. Full pool written, AMEND drafted.

**Check A -- Sequential Default**
Identify 5 top-5 candidates. Are they the first 5 ideas generated? If yes, rescan the
full pool -- the strongest ideas surface across the whole run, not only at the start.
Output of Check A: 5 candidates advancing to the Registry.

**Check B -- Peer-Comparison Registry**

For each of the 5 candidates, write one row. Do not fill in Selected? during construction.

| # | Candidate (exact name from pool) | Peer (exact name, same ## section, unmarked) | I chose [Candidate] over [Peer] because ___ | Selected? |
|---|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

Write all five "I chose ... because ___" sentences before evaluating any of them.
Do not assess whether a row passes while other rows remain blank.

**Column rules:**
- **Candidate**: exact idea name from Phase 1b; one of the 5 from Check A
- **Peer**: exact name of one specific unmarked idea in the same `##` section; cannot
  be blank
- **"I chose ... because ___"**: complete the sentence with a specific reason tied to
  {{topic}}'s actual constraints (scope, user group, cost, risk); "it is better" or
  "more viable" do not count
- **Selected?**: Phase-advance gate. This column cannot hold any value, and Phase 3
  cannot begin, until both preconditions hold simultaneously: (a) all 5 rows of this
  Registry are written in your output, AND (b) Selected? is blank across all 5 rows.
  A partial Registry has no valid Selected? entries. A Registry where any Selected?
  cell carries a preliminary value does not satisfy the gate. Phase 3 may begin only
  when the Registry is structurally complete (5 rows) and selection-clean (Selected?
  blank in every row). This is a schema property of the Registry.

**Prohibition Battery:**

**Prohibition A -- Marking Ban**: Do not place any `**` marks anywhere in your output
while Phase 2 Check B is in progress -- not on headings, inline, in notes, or in any
other form. No `**` marks may appear until the complete 5-row Registry is written.

**Prohibition B -- Rationalization Block**: If you cannot complete the comparison sentence
for any row -- no specific peer holds or no specific reason applies -- that candidate must
be replaced by the peer named in the Peer column. The replacement source is fixed: it is
the peer from this row, not an alternative selected after reconsidering. Do not revise the
candidate's rationale to manufacture a distinction that was not present at comparison time.
If editing the candidate's rationale would make the comparison sentence completable, that
desire confirms the replacement obligation applies -- the impulse to revise so the
comparison can pass is not permission to reopen the comparison; it is the signal the swap
is mandatory.

**Check C -- AMEND Distribution-Shift Test**
For each of the 3 AMEND directions from 1c, verify: re-running with only this directive
must surface candidate ideas not in the current pool. Sharpen any that would produce the
same candidates under different framing. Output of Check C: final AMEND content.

**Check D -- Inertia Placement**
Does the Phase 1a paragraph appear as the first element in the artifact? If not, reorder.

> **Phase 2 complete** when: all 5 Registry rows written, Selected? blank in every row,
> Checks A/C/D done, no `**` marks in output. Phase 3 may begin only when all four

## Phase 3 -- Finalize

*Phase 3 requires: Phase 2 complete (5-row Registry written, Selected? blank in all rows).*

Fill Selected? = YES in exactly 5 rows (candidates confirmed in Check B, with any
substitutions from Prohibition B applied). Mark those 5 ideas with `**` on their
headings in the dimension sections. Use the AMEND content finalized in Check C.

Write the artifact to:

### V-05 -- Phase 3 Close Signal in Conversational Register (C-45 form test)

**Axis**: Phrasing register -- the Phase 3 closing lifecycle signal uses conversational
second-person phrasing in a blockquote rather than formal third-person declaration. All
other lifecycle tags (Pre-Phase, Phase 0, Phase 1, Phase 2) use the formal `> **Phase N
complete.**` pattern established in V-02 R15. Phase 3 gets a close signal only (no opening
tag, C-46 FAIL by design) in conversational form: `> Phase 3 done. Artifact is at
\`simulations/draft/brainstorm/{{topic}}-brainstorm-{{date}}.md\`. You may close.`

**Hypothesis**: C-45's pass condition requires "a dedicated closing lifecycle signal ...
that: (a) names Phase 3 completion explicitly, and (b) explicitly signals session end or
artifact written." The conversational form names completion ("Phase 3 done") and signals
artifact location. The question is whether the rubric's structural requirement (blockquote
or callout) is satisfied by a lowercase-first-word blockquote without bold markup -- the
form differs from the established pattern, but the blockquote delimiter `>` is present.
If C-45 passes with conversational blockquote form, it confirms the criterion is about
structural placement (blockquote as dedicated marker) not bold formatting. If it fails,
it suggests C-45 requires the bold name pattern (`**Phase N complete.**`). V-04 R16 is
C-45 PASS with formal form (control). V-05 R16 is C-45 ? with conversational form (test).

**Expected**: C-01..C-44 PASS (inh from V-02 R15 backbone) + C-45 ?: **180** under v15
regardless of C-45 form (C-45 not in v15). Under hypothetical v17: **187.5 if conversational
form passes** (C-45 PASS, C-46 FAIL) or **185 if conversational form fails** (C-45 FAIL,
C-46 FAIL -- inherits C-43+C-44 from backbone = 185 base). Form test is the distinguishing
signal.

## Pre-Phase -- Generative Lenses

*Pre-Phase opens now. No preconditions.*

Before writing a single idea or establishing the inertia baseline, define 3 directions
that will actively pull the pool away from its center of gravity. These are production
constraints -- they determine which ideas appear in Phase 1, not which ideas survive
a post-hoc filter.

For each lens:
- **Lens name**: one phrase (e.g., "More Ambitious", "Audience Shift", "Incremental")
- **Direction**: one sentence describing the shift axis
- **Pool impact**: what kinds of ideas appear under this lens that would not appear in a

- **Re-run test**: if a reader took only this lens and re-ran the brainstorm, would the
  resulting pool contain ideas not in the current pool? Different candidates, not the same
  candidates under different labels. If not, sharpen the lens before proceeding.

Write all 3 lenses. Do not begin Phase 0 until all 3 lenses pass the re-run test.

> **Pre-Phase complete.** All 3 lenses pass the re-run test. Phase 0 opens now.

## Phase 0 -- Inertia Baseline

> **Phase 0 opens now. No preconditions.**

Before generating any candidate ideas, fully specify the Do Nothing option for {{topic}}.
This is the most important entry in the pool: it is already in play, and every other
candidate exists to displace it.

Write the following four fields:

**Current Trajectory**: What is happening to {{topic}} right now with no deliberate
intervention? Name the specific direction the system, team, or product is already moving.
(2-3 sentences.)

**Accumulated Cost**: What concretely accumulates -- technically, organizationally, or for
users -- if this trajectory continues for 12 months? Be specific: what is delayed,
degraded, or foreclosed? (2-3 sentences.)

**Displacement Target**: What must a competing idea change about the trajectory to beat
this baseline? State the minimum threshold: "A candidate beats Do Nothing if and only if
it [specific condition]." (1 sentence.)

## Phase 1 -- Idea Pool

*Phase 1 requires: Phase 0 complete (all four fields + Do Nothing entry written).*

> **Phase 1 opens now.** Phase 0 complete. Do Nothing established.

### 1a. Inertia Frame

Write a paragraph (3-5 sentences) expanding on the Phase 0 baseline for a general reader:
What is the current trajectory for {{topic}}? What does the team inherit if no deliberate
decision is made? What does the path of least resistance produce -- technically,
organizationally, or for users?

This paragraph must appear as the first element in the final artifact, before any ideas.

### 1b. Idea Pool

Using the 3 Pre-Phase lenses as active generation constraints, produce **19-39 additional
candidates** for {{topic}} -- for a total of 20-40 ideas including the Phase 0 Do Nothing
entry. Your output must contain one labeled section per required dimension. Each is a
**mandatory `##` section** -- do not collapse into a flat list, do not omit any. You may
add sections beyond the six required.

**Required dimensions (each must appear as a `##` section):**
- **Scope** -- how much of {{topic}}'s problem space is addressed
- **Timing** -- when the intervention lands in the product lifecycle
- **Integration** -- how it connects to existing systems or teams
- **Audience** -- who benefits most
- **Build vs. Buy** -- internal build, external adoption, or extension of existing
- **Status Quo** -- contains exactly the Do Nothing entry from Phase 0

**Lens attribution**: Tag at least 2 ideas per lens inline (e.g., `[Lens: Audience Shift]`).
Aim for at least 6 lens-attributed ideas total. Center-of-gravity ideas are permitted but
must not dominate the pool.

**Do not mark top-5 yet.** Generate the complete pool before selecting. Do not place any
`**` markers on any idea during Phase 1. Marking as you write introduces sequential bias --
finish the pool first.

For each idea (other than Do Nothing):
```
### [Idea Name]

**Pitch**: One sentence.
**Rationale**: Why this serves {{topic}} specifically -- cite a real constraint, user need,
or opportunity. Include one sentence naming how this idea changes the Phase 0 trajectory:
what specifically does it displace or prevent?
```

### 1c. AMEND Draft

Write a draft AMEND section with 3 pool-shift directions. For each:
- Name the shift axis
- Describe what kinds of ideas would appear or disappear
- Apply the distribution-shift test: re-running with only this directive must produce
  candidate ideas not in the current pool. Different candidates, not the same candidates
  under different framing. A direction that shifts only emphasis or category labels without
  introducing different underlying candidates fails this test.

Do not finalize AMEND yet -- it will be verified in Phase 2 Check C.

> **Phase 1 complete.** The full pool (19-39 net-new ideas + Do Nothing = 20-40 total) is
> written. AMEND draft written. No `**` marks in output. Phase 2 may begin.

## Phase 2 -- Peer-Comparison

*Phase 2 requires: Phase 1 complete ("Phase 1 complete." signal written above).*

> **Phase 2 opens now.** Phase 1 complete. Full pool written, AMEND drafted.

**Check A -- Sequential Default**
Identify 5 top-5 candidates. Are they the first 5 ideas generated? If yes, rescan the
full pool -- the strongest ideas surface across the whole run, not only at the start.
Output of Check A: 5 candidates advancing to the Registry.

**Check B -- Peer-Comparison Registry**

For each of the 5 candidates, write one row. Do not fill in Selected? during construction.

| # | Candidate (exact name from pool) | Peer (exact name, same ## section, unmarked) | I chose [Candidate] over [Peer] because ___ | Selected? |
|---|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

Write all five "I chose ... because ___" sentences before evaluating any of them.
Do not assess whether a row passes while other rows remain blank.

**Column rules:**
- **Candidate**: exact idea name from Phase 1b; one of the 5 from Check A
- **Peer**: exact name of one specific unmarked idea in the same `##` section; cannot
  be blank
- **"I chose ... because ___"**: complete the sentence with a specific reason tied to
  {{topic}}'s actual constraints (scope, user group, cost, risk); "it is better" or
  "more viable" do not count
- **Selected?**: Phase-advance gate. This column cannot hold any value, and Phase 3
  cannot begin, until both preconditions hold simultaneously: (a) all 5 rows of this
  Registry are written in your output, AND (b) Selected? is blank across all 5 rows.
  A partial Registry has no valid Selected? entries. A Registry where any Selected?
  cell carries a preliminary value does not satisfy the gate. Phase 3 may begin only
  when the Registry is structurally complete (5 rows) and selection-clean (Selected?
  blank in every row). This is a schema property of the Registry.

**Prohibition Battery:**

**Prohibition A -- Marking Ban**: Do not place any `**` marks anywhere in your output
while Phase 2 Check B is in progress -- not on headings, inline, in notes, or in any
other form. No `**` marks may appear until the complete 5-row Registry is written.

**Prohibition B -- Rationalization Block**: If you cannot complete the comparison sentence
for any row -- no specific peer holds or no specific reason applies -- that candidate must
be replaced by the peer named in the Peer column. The replacement source is fixed: it is
the peer from this row, not an alternative selected after reconsidering. Do not revise the
candidate's rationale to manufacture a distinction that was not present at comparison time.
If editing the candidate's rationale would make the comparison sentence completable, that
desire confirms the replacement obligation applies -- the impulse to revise so the
comparison can pass is not permission to reopen the comparison; it is the signal the swap
is mandatory.

**Check C -- AMEND Distribution-Shift Test**
For each of the 3 AMEND directions from 1c, verify: re-running with only this directive
must surface candidate ideas not in the current pool. Sharpen any that would produce the
same candidates under different framing. Output of Check C: final AMEND content.

**Check D -- Inertia Placement**
Does the Phase 1a paragraph appear as the first element in the artifact? If not, reorder.

> **Phase 2 complete** when: all 5 Registry rows written, Selected? blank in every row,
> Checks A/C/D done, no `**` marks in output. Phase 3 may begin only when all four
> conditions are met simultaneously.

---

## Phase 3 -- Finalize

*Phase 3 requires: Phase 2 complete (5-row Registry written, Selected? blank in all rows).*

> **GATE PRECONDITIONS -- both must hold before Phase 3 may begin:**
> - **(a)** All 5 rows of the Peer-Comparison Registry are written in your output
> - **(b)** Selected? is blank across all 5 rows of the Registry
>
> A Registry with fewer than 5 rows does not satisfy (a). A Registry where any
> Selected? cell holds any value does not satisfy (b). Both conditions must hold
> simultaneously before any finalization step below may proceed.

Fill Selected? = YES in exactly 5 rows (candidates confirmed in Check B, with any
substitutions from Prohibition B applied). Mark those 5 ideas with `**` on their
headings in the dimension sections. Use the AMEND content finalized in Check C.

Write the artifact to:
`simulations/draft/brainstorm/{{topic}}-brainstorm-{{date}}.md`

```yaml
---
skill: draft-brainstorm
topic: {{topic}}
date: {{date}}
---
```

Artifact order: Inertia paragraph (1a), Phase 0 baseline block (Trajectory / Cost /
Displacement Target), dimension sections (top-5 marked, lens tags removed), Peer-
Comparison Registry, AMEND (3 directions, distribution-shift-verified). Total ideas
including Do Nothing: 20-40.

> Phase 3 done. Artifact is at `simulations/draft/brainstorm/{{topic}}-brainstorm-{{date}}.md`. You may close.
```

## Score projections

| Variation | v15 score | Hypothetical v16 (+C-43, +C-44) | Hypothetical v17 (+C-45, +C-46) |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| V-01 | 180 | 185 | 187.5 (C-45 PASS, C-46 FAIL) |
| V-02 | 180 | 185 | 190 (C-45+C-46 PASS -- first to 190) |
| V-03 | 177.5 | 180 (C-43 PASS, C-44 FAIL) | 180 (no Phase 3 signals) |
| V-04 | 180 | 185 | 190 (C-45+C-46 PASS) |
| V-05 | 180 | 185 | 187.5 if conversational form passes C-45 / 185 if fails |

**Max raised**: 180 (v15) -> 185 (hypothetical v16) -> 190 (hypothetical v17).

**C-43/C-44 key fact**: Phase 2 close signal (`> **Phase 2 complete** when:...Phase 3 may
begin...`) is already present in the V-02 R14 baseline (175). All R15 and R16 variations
inherit it. Under hypothetical v16, V-02 R14 baseline rises from 175 to 177.5 (C-43 PASS,
C-44 FAIL). The C-44 carrier is any variation with the Phase 2 opening blockquote -- that
is V-02 R15 and all R16 variations except V-03.

**C-45 form test (V-05)**: V-05's Phase 3 close signal uses a conversational blockquote
(`> Phase 3 done.`) without bold markup. V-04's uses the formal pattern
(`> **Phase 3 complete.**`). Scoring C-45 PASS on V-04 and FAIL on V-05 would establish
that the criterion requires the `**Phase N complete.**` bold-name form, not just a
blockquote at Phase 3 end. Scoring both PASS would establish that the blockquote delimiter
is sufficient and bold markup is optional.
