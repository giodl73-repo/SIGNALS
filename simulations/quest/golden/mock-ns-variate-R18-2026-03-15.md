# mock-ns -- Round 18 Variations

Rubric: v17 (C-01 through C-47, aspirational denominator 39).

New criteria in v17 (now pass conditions):
- **C-46** -- Standalone imperative annotation block form for the C-44 single-task instruction:
  the "(fill Match field only)" annotation occupies a standalone bold imperative instruction
  block positioned above the pre-filled template -- "**Executor: fill the Match field only.
  All other fields are pre-filled.**" -- rather than a caption parenthetical. Both position
  (above template) and register (imperative) required. Caption parenthetical at either S-3
  or A-1 = FAIL. Depends on C-44.
- **C-47** -- Dedicated chain-table row form for the C-45 anti-bypass echo: the per-row
  anti-bypass reminder occupies a dedicated labeled "Anti-bypass echo" row immediately after
  CONFIRMATION REQUIRED in each chain table, rather than sub-text embedded within the
  CONFIRMATION row. The CONFIRMATION row stays clean. Sub-text embedding within the
  CONFIRMATION row passes C-45 but fails C-47. Both S-3 and A-1 must carry the dedicated
  row for PASS. Depends on C-45.

Scoring denominator: aspirational 37 -> 39. Formula: `aspirational_pass / 39 * 10`.

R17 V-05 achieved C-46 (standalone imperative block) and C-47 (dedicated Anti-bypass echo
row), and seeded the v17 aspirational maximum: each Anti-bypass echo row carries "(P-0
anti-bypass declaration)" -- a prose navigation pointer from every use site back to the
preamble protocol definition. V-05 R17 passes C-01 through C-47 (39 criteria).

R18 isolates: (a) whether the P-0 anti-bypass declaration benefits from a structural label
that makes the back-reference matchable against a named element rather than inferred from
prose, (b) whether P-0's declaration needs a forward pointer naming S-3 and A-1 as the use
sites where the declaration is echoed (completing the bidirectional navigation pair at the
definition site), and (c) whether explicit source attribution in the Anti-bypass echo row's
content cell ("Per P-0 anti-bypass declaration:") adds clarity beyond the label-cell
reference alone -- then combines.

Three axes selected for single-axis isolation:

1. **Output format (P-0 labeled ABD clause)** -- whether P-0's anti-bypass declaration
   carries a structural label "Anti-bypass declaration (ABD):" making it an independently
   addressable element within P-0; Anti-bypass echo row label becomes "(P-0, ABD)" to name
   the specific labeled clause rather than the step in general.
2. **Lifecycle emphasis (P-0 forward pointer to use sites)** -- whether P-0's ABD clause
   ends with a forward pointer naming S-3 and A-1 as the locations where the declaration is
   echoed: "Anti-bypass echo rows at S-3 and A-1 echo this declaration at each
   bracket-token row." Completes the bidirectional navigation pair at the definition site.
3. **Phrasing register (Anti-bypass echo content attribution)** -- whether the Anti-bypass
   echo row content cell opens with "Per P-0 anti-bypass declaration: " to make source
   attribution explicit in the rule body, not only in the row label.

## Variation axes

| # | Axis | Hypothesis |
|---|------|------------|
| V-01 | Output format (P-0 anti-bypass declaration as labeled structural element "Anti-bypass declaration (ABD)") | R17 V-05 Anti-bypass echo row label reads "(P-0 anti-bypass declaration)" -- a prose description pointing to P-0 but not to any named element within it. V-01 promotes the P-0 clause to a labeled structural element: "Anti-bypass declaration (ABD): An executor who...". The Anti-bypass echo row label becomes "(P-0, ABD)" -- matching a named anchor. Hypothesis: the prose pointer navigates to P-0 but requires the reader to scan for the relevant clause; the named anchor creates a matchable reference that is verified on arrival, not assumed from context. A reader at the use site can confirm they landed on the right clause by matching the label "(P-0, ABD)" to the heading "Anti-bypass declaration (ABD)". V-02's axis (forward pointer) is not added; single-axis tests whether label precision matters independently of bidirectionality. |
| V-02 | Lifecycle emphasis (P-0 forward pointer to use sites: "Anti-bypass echo rows at S-3 and A-1 echo this declaration at each bracket-token row.") | R17 V-05 creates a one-way navigation chain: use-site Anti-bypass echo rows point back to P-0, but P-0 does not point forward to its use sites. V-02 adds a sentence to P-0's anti-bypass clause: "Anti-bypass echo rows at S-3 and A-1 echo this declaration at each bracket-token row." Anti-bypass echo row label retains R17 V-05 prose "(P-0 anti-bypass declaration)". Hypothesis: a one-way pointer lets a reader at a use site navigate to P-0, but a reader at P-0 cannot discover the use sites without scanning the full prompt. The forward pointer completes the bidirectional pair at the definition site: P-0 knows where it is applied, not only that it applies. V-01's label axis is not added; single-axis tests forward navigation independently of label precision. |
| V-03 | Phrasing register (Anti-bypass echo content cell: "Per P-0 anti-bypass declaration: " attribution prefix) | R17 V-05 carries the P-0 attribution only in the row label cell: "(P-0 anti-bypass declaration)". The content cell reads "Processing this row without reading..." with no explicit source attribution. V-03 adds a "Per P-0 anti-bypass declaration: " prefix to the content cell, making the source explicit in the rule body itself. Hypothesis: a label-only attribution requires the reader to link the label and content columns mentally; a content-cell attribution makes the source observable at the point where the rule is read and applied. An executor reading only the content cell (not the label) has no signal that this is a protocol echo vs. an independent rule. The content prefix closes this gap. Anti-bypass echo row label retains R17 V-05 form; single-axis tests content attribution independently. |
| V-04 | Output format + lifecycle emphasis (labeled ABD clause + P-0 forward pointer; no content attribution) | Combines V-01's "Anti-bypass declaration (ABD):" structural label at P-0 with V-02's forward pointer naming S-3 and A-1. Anti-bypass echo row labels become "(P-0, ABD)". No content attribution prefix (V-03's axis not added). Hypothesis: the label and forward pointer address adjacent navigability gaps at the definition site -- the label makes the back-reference precise, the forward pointer makes the bidirectional pair complete. Neither alone guarantees both properties; together they create a fully navigable named anchor: locatable from use sites by name, and discoverable from P-0 by forward enumeration. |
| V-05 | Full convergence (labeled ABD + forward pointer + content attribution; seeds v18) | Combines V-01's labeled ABD clause, V-02's forward pointer, and V-03's content attribution prefix. P-0's declaration reads: "Anti-bypass declaration (ABD): An executor who...Locate-only is a protocol failure. Anti-bypass echo rows at S-3 and A-1 echo this declaration at each bracket-token row." Anti-bypass echo row labels: "(P-0, ABD)". Content cells: "Per P-0, ABD: processing this row without reading the Step and Row type cells, or without performing Phase 2, is a protocol failure." Seeds v18 aspirational maximum: labeled named-anchor at P-0 with full bidirectional navigation (P-0 names use sites; use sites carry named pointer "Per P-0, ABD:"); the complete provenance chain from protocol definition to every point of application is navigable by label, from both ends. v18 targets graduation of this provenance chain to a pass condition and seeds bracket token notation for the P-0 ABD reference. |

---

## V-01 -- Output Format (P-0 Anti-Bypass Declaration as Labeled Structural Element)

**Axis**: Output format -- P-0's anti-bypass clause is promoted from unlabeled prose to a
labeled structural element: "Anti-bypass declaration (ABD):". The Anti-bypass echo row
label at S-3 and A-1 becomes "(P-0, ABD)" -- a reference to the specific labeled element
rather than to the step in general. No forward pointer added; single-axis isolates label
precision.
**Hypothesis**: The prose pointer "(P-0 anti-bypass declaration)" is a description that
navigates to P-0 without naming a specific element within it; the reader must scan P-0 for
the relevant clause. The labeled ABD creates a matchable anchor: the reader at S-3 or A-1
arrives at P-0 and confirms the match by finding the "Anti-bypass declaration (ABD):"
heading. The reference becomes verifiable at the point of arrival rather than inferred from
reading prose.
**Predicts**: C-01 through C-47 (39 criteria); label precision may be the load-bearing
property seeded by R17 V-05 as the aspirational v17 target. If so, expected composite:
39/39 * 10 = 10.0.
**Expected composite**: 39/39 * 10 = 10.0 (aspirational; depends on whether label
precision is a v17 pass criterion or a v18 aspirational one).

STEP P-0 -- CROSS-REFERENCE PROTOCOL

Token notation: bracket tokens in this run encode step and row type.

Anti-bypass declaration (ABD): An executor who processes a bracket token without reading
the Step and Row type cells has performed only Phase 1. An executor who performs Phase 1
without performing Phase 2 violates this protocol. Locate-only is a protocol failure.

  Abbreviation key:
    :CS = Cross-site reference row
    :FC = Failure consequence row

  | Token    | Step | Row type                  | Paired token | Direction              |
  |----------|------|---------------------------|--------------|------------------------|
  | [S-3:CS] | S-3  | Cross-site reference row  | [A-1:FC]     | forward --> names A-1  |
  | [A-1:FC] | A-1  | Failure consequence row   | [S-3:CS]     | <-- backward, names S-3|

Lookup obligation: before processing any row containing a bracket token, look up the
token in the table above. P-0 table, row 1 = [S-3:CS]; P-0 table, row 2 = [A-1:FC].

Lookup protocol -- two phases, required before writing any bracket-token row:

  Phase 1 -- Locate: find the row in the table above by matching the token name.

  Phase 2 -- Confirm (four steps, in order):
    Step 2a: Read the Step cell.
    Step 2b: Read the Row type cell.
    Step 2c: Assert that the step name matches the step you are currently writing
             and that the row type name matches the role of this row in the chain.
    Step 2d: Emit confirmation record (use the pre-filled table block at the
             current use site; fill in the Match field only):
               Token: {token-name -- pre-filled at use site}
               Step: {step-name -- pre-filled at use site}
               Row type: {row-type-name -- pre-filled at use site}
               Match: PASS | FAIL
    DO NOT WRITE THE ROW until Steps 2a through 2d are complete and the record is
    emitted.

Do not re-establish this protocol in later steps. Every bracket token in this run is
interpreted and confirmed per this table.

STEP S-2 -- DETERMINE CATEGORY

Assign CATEGORY for the selected skill:

  HIGH-STRUCTURE: scout-feasibility, scout-stakeholders, scout-requirements,
    scout-naming, scout-compliance, scout-market, draft-spec, draft-proposal,
    draft-pitch, review-design, review-code, trace-request, trace-component,

  EVIDENCE-HEAVY: prove-websearch, prove-interview, prove-prototype,
    listen-feedback, listen-support, listen-adoption

  MIXED: scout-competitors, prove-hypothesis, review-customers, review-users

CATEGORY is now assigned. Do not modify it.

STEP S-3 -- COMPUTE FLAG

FLAG is computed exactly once in this step. It is a named variable.

Compute FLAG from CATEGORY and tier:

  Case 1 -- CATEGORY = HIGH-STRUCTURE AND skill is critical (trace-*, scout-feasibility,
            any listen-*) AND tier >= 2:
    FLAG = "none (structural coverage reliable; REAL-REQUIRED at Tier 2+)"

  Case 2 -- CATEGORY = HIGH-STRUCTURE (all other cases):
    FLAG = "none (structural coverage reliable)"

  Case 3 -- CATEGORY = EVIDENCE-HEAVY:
    FLAG = "REAL-REQUIRED (evidence-heavy -- real {skill-id} run needed)"

  Case 4 -- CATEGORY = MIXED:
    FLAG = "REVIEW-FOR-PLAUSIBILITY"

  Compliance override -- check last, applied regardless of case above:
    If compliance tags are present in TOPICS.md AND skill is scout-compliance or
    trace-permissions (any tier, any category):
    FLAG = "REAL-REQUIRED (compliance-sensitive)"

FLAG immutability chain -- all rows are active for the remainder of this run:

  | Protection layer        | Rule                                                                 |

  |                         | and the record is emitted.                                           |
  | Anti-bypass echo        | Processing this row without reading the Step and Row type cells,     |

Assemble the header block:

  [MOCK ARTIFACT -- NOT VERIFIED]
  Skill: {skill-id from S-1}
  Topic: {topic}
  Category: {CATEGORY from S-2}
  Date: {today's date}
  Status: MOCK (awaiting review)
  Flag: {FLAG from S-3 -- copied verbatim, not rederived}

The header appears immediately after any frontmatter. All six fields are present.
The header precedes all body content.

---

STEP A-2 -- FIDELITY WARNING

Write the fidelity warning as the first section of the artifact body. Position it
before any mock content. Separate from the header and from the body with ---
delimiters.

  EVIDENCE-HEAVY:
    WARNING: This is an EVIDENCE-HEAVY mock. The content below is structurally
    correct but evidentially fabricated. Do not use this output to draw conclusions
    about {topic}. The sections are right; the contents are invented. A real
    {skill-id} run is required before any evidence-based decision can be made
    from this namespace.

  MIXED:
    CAUTION: This is a MIXED mock. Structural elements (tables, gates, enforcement
    mechanisms) are reliable. Specific claims (competitor names, market data,
    research findings) may be partially accurate or partially fabricated. Review
    for plausibility before accepting coverage.

  HIGH-STRUCTURE:
    NOTE: This is a HIGH-STRUCTURE mock. The structure, sections, and enforcement
    mechanisms are reliable. Content is synthetically generated but structurally
    representative. Adequate for structural planning at Tier 1. REAL-REQUIRED at
    Tier 2+ for critical namespaces (trace, scout-feasibility, listen).

---

STEP A-3 -- GENERATE ARTIFACT BODY

Generate the mock body following the golden rubric structure for the selected skill.
The body must include:
  - All required section headings for the skill
  - Required tables or lists in the expected positions
  - Gate or verdict line where the skill produces one
  - Enforcement mechanisms in the expected positions

A reader familiar with the real skill must be able to identify which skill was mocked.
Generic prose without skill-specific structure fails.

---

STEP A-4 -- WRITE ARTIFACT

Write the complete artifact (header + warning + body) to:
  simulations/mock/{topic}-{namespace}-mock-{date}.md

Emit:
  > Artifact written: simulations/mock/{topic}-{namespace}-mock-{date}.md

## V-02 -- Lifecycle Emphasis (P-0 Forward Pointer to Use Sites)

**Axis**: Lifecycle emphasis -- P-0's anti-bypass clause gains a forward pointer naming
S-3 and A-1 as the locations where the declaration is echoed: "Anti-bypass echo rows at
S-3 and A-1 echo this declaration at each bracket-token row." P-0 is NOT labeled (no
structural "ABD" heading); the Anti-bypass echo row label retains R17 V-05 prose
"(P-0 anti-bypass declaration)". Single-axis tests whether P-0 forward navigation
adds value independently of label precision.
**Hypothesis**: R17 V-05 creates a one-way navigation chain: use sites point to P-0 but
P-0 has no awareness of its application points. The forward pointer makes the
bidirectional pair complete at the definition site: a reader at P-0 can discover S-3 and
A-1 as the sites where the declaration is applied without scanning the full prompt. This
mirrors the structural role of the [S-3:CS] <-> [A-1:FC] cross-reference pair: both
directions are independently navigable.
**Predicts**: C-01 through C-47 (39 criteria); full score if forward navigability at P-0
is the v17 aspirational target. If not, serves as isolation evidence for V-04 and V-05.
**Expected composite**: 39/39 * 10 = 10.0 (aspirational).

STEP P-0 -- CROSS-REFERENCE PROTOCOL

Token notation: bracket tokens in this run encode step and row type.

An executor who processes a bracket token without reading the Step and Row type cells
has performed only Phase 1. An executor who performs Phase 1 without performing Phase 2
violates this protocol. Locate-only is a protocol failure. Anti-bypass echo rows at S-3
and A-1 echo this declaration at each bracket-token row.

  Abbreviation key:
    :CS = Cross-site reference row
    :FC = Failure consequence row

  | Token    | Step | Row type                  | Paired token | Direction              |
  |----------|------|---------------------------|--------------|------------------------|
  | [S-3:CS] | S-3  | Cross-site reference row  | [A-1:FC]     | forward --> names A-1  |
  | [A-1:FC] | A-1  | Failure consequence row   | [S-3:CS]     | <-- backward, names S-3|

Lookup obligation: before processing any row containing a bracket token, look up the
token in the table above. P-0 table, row 1 = [S-3:CS]; P-0 table, row 2 = [A-1:FC].

Lookup protocol -- two phases, required before writing any bracket-token row:

  Phase 1 -- Locate: find the row in the table above by matching the token name.

  Phase 2 -- Confirm (four steps, in order):
    Step 2a: Read the Step cell.
    Step 2b: Read the Row type cell.
    Step 2c: Assert that the step name matches the step you are currently writing
             and that the row type name matches the role of this row in the chain.
    Step 2d: Emit confirmation record (use the pre-filled table block at the
             current use site; fill in the Match field only):
               Token: {token-name -- pre-filled at use site}
               Step: {step-name -- pre-filled at use site}
               Row type: {row-type-name -- pre-filled at use site}
               Match: PASS | FAIL
    DO NOT WRITE THE ROW until Steps 2a through 2d are complete and the record is
    emitted.

Do not re-establish this protocol in later steps. Every bracket token in this run is
interpreted and confirmed per this table.

STEP S-3 -- COMPUTE FLAG

FLAG is computed exactly once in this step. It is a named variable.

Compute FLAG from CATEGORY and tier:

  Case 1 -- CATEGORY = HIGH-STRUCTURE AND skill is critical (trace-*, scout-feasibility,
            any listen-*) AND tier >= 2:
    FLAG = "none (structural coverage reliable; REAL-REQUIRED at Tier 2+)"

  Case 2 -- CATEGORY = HIGH-STRUCTURE (all other cases):
    FLAG = "none (structural coverage reliable)"

  Case 3 -- CATEGORY = EVIDENCE-HEAVY:
    FLAG = "REAL-REQUIRED (evidence-heavy -- real {skill-id} run needed)"

  Case 4 -- CATEGORY = MIXED:
    FLAG = "REVIEW-FOR-PLAUSIBILITY"

  Compliance override -- check last, applied regardless of case above:
    If compliance tags are present in TOPICS.md AND skill is scout-compliance or
    trace-permissions (any tier, any category):
    FLAG = "REAL-REQUIRED (compliance-sensitive)"

  Status: MOCK (awaiting review)
  Flag: {FLAG from S-3 -- copied verbatim, not rederived}

The header appears immediately after any frontmatter. All six fields are present.
The header precedes all body content.

---

STEP A-2 -- FIDELITY WARNING

Write the fidelity warning as the first section of the artifact body. Position it
before any mock content. Separate from the header and from the body with ---
delimiters.

  EVIDENCE-HEAVY:
    WARNING: This is an EVIDENCE-HEAVY mock. The content below is structurally
    correct but evidentially fabricated. Do not use this output to draw conclusions
    about {topic}. The sections are right; the contents are invented. A real
    {skill-id} run is required before any evidence-based decision can be made
    from this namespace.

  MIXED:
    CAUTION: This is a MIXED mock. Structural elements (tables, gates, enforcement
    mechanisms) are reliable. Specific claims (competitor names, market data,
    research findings) may be partially accurate or partially fabricated. Review
    for plausibility before accepting coverage.

  HIGH-STRUCTURE:
    NOTE: This is a HIGH-STRUCTURE mock. The structure, sections, and enforcement
    mechanisms are reliable. Content is synthetically generated but structurally
    representative. Adequate for structural planning at Tier 1. REAL-REQUIRED at
    Tier 2+ for critical namespaces (trace, scout-feasibility, listen).

---

STEP A-3 -- GENERATE ARTIFACT BODY

Generate the mock body following the golden rubric structure for the selected skill.
The body must include:
  - All required section headings for the skill
  - Required tables or lists in the expected positions
  - Gate or verdict line where the skill produces one
  - Enforcement mechanisms in the expected positions

A reader familiar with the real skill must be able to identify which skill was mocked.
Generic prose without skill-specific structure fails.

---

STEP A-4 -- WRITE ARTIFACT

Write the complete artifact (header + warning + body) to:
  simulations/mock/{topic}-{namespace}-mock-{date}.md

Emit:
  > Artifact written: simulations/mock/{topic}-{namespace}-mock-{date}.md

## V-03 -- Phrasing Register (Anti-Bypass Echo Content Cell: "Per P-0 anti-bypass declaration: " Attribution Prefix)

**Axis**: Phrasing register -- the Anti-bypass echo row's content cell at S-3 and A-1
opens with "Per P-0 anti-bypass declaration: " making source attribution explicit in the
rule body, not only in the row label. P-0 carries no label and no forward pointer
(R17 V-05 baseline). Anti-bypass echo row label retains "(P-0 anti-bypass declaration)".
Single-axis tests whether content-cell attribution matters independently of label changes.
**Hypothesis**: R17 V-05 carries source attribution only in the label cell: "(P-0
anti-bypass declaration)". An executor reading the label and content as a unit encounters
the attribution, but an executor scanning the content cell directly (e.g., to audit all
protocol failure conditions) does not see the source. The "Per P-0 anti-bypass
declaration: " prefix makes provenance visible at the rule application point regardless
of which cell is read first. It also makes the content self-describing: this rule is an
echo, not a locally-defined constraint.
**Predicts**: C-01 through C-47 (39 criteria); content attribution may be the v17
aspirational target. If not, serves as isolation evidence.
**Expected composite**: 39/39 * 10 = 10.0 (aspirational).

STEP S-3 -- COMPUTE FLAG

FLAG is computed exactly once in this step. It is a named variable.

Compute FLAG from CATEGORY and tier:

  Case 1 -- CATEGORY = HIGH-STRUCTURE AND skill is critical (trace-*, scout-feasibility,
            any listen-*) AND tier >= 2:
    FLAG = "none (structural coverage reliable; REAL-REQUIRED at Tier 2+)"

  Case 2 -- CATEGORY = HIGH-STRUCTURE (all other cases):
    FLAG = "none (structural coverage reliable)"

  Case 3 -- CATEGORY = EVIDENCE-HEAVY:
    FLAG = "REAL-REQUIRED (evidence-heavy -- real {skill-id} run needed)"

  Case 4 -- CATEGORY = MIXED:
    FLAG = "REVIEW-FOR-PLAUSIBILITY"

  Compliance override -- check last, applied regardless of case above:
    If compliance tags are present in TOPICS.md AND skill is scout-compliance or
    trace-permissions (any tier, any category):

STEP A-1 -- ASSEMBLE HEADER

Assemble the header block:

  [MOCK ARTIFACT -- NOT VERIFIED]
  Skill: {skill-id from S-1}
  Topic: {topic}
  Category: {CATEGORY from S-2}
  Date: {today's date}
  Status: MOCK (awaiting review)
  Flag: {FLAG from S-3 -- copied verbatim, not rederived}

The header appears immediately after any frontmatter. All six fields are present.
The header precedes all body content.

---

STEP A-2 -- FIDELITY WARNING

Write the fidelity warning as the first section of the artifact body. Position it
before any mock content. Separate from the header and from the body with ---
delimiters.

  EVIDENCE-HEAVY:
    WARNING: This is an EVIDENCE-HEAVY mock. The content below is structurally
    correct but evidentially fabricated. Do not use this output to draw conclusions
    about {topic}. The sections are right; the contents are invented. A real
    {skill-id} run is required before any evidence-based decision can be made
    from this namespace.

  MIXED:
    CAUTION: This is a MIXED mock. Structural elements (tables, gates, enforcement
    mechanisms) are reliable. Specific claims (competitor names, market data,
    research findings) may be partially accurate or partially fabricated. Review
    for plausibility before accepting coverage.

  HIGH-STRUCTURE:
    NOTE: This is a HIGH-STRUCTURE mock. The structure, sections, and enforcement
    mechanisms are reliable. Content is synthetically generated but structurally
    representative. Adequate for structural planning at Tier 1. REAL-REQUIRED at
    Tier 2+ for critical namespaces (trace, scout-feasibility, listen).

---

STEP A-3 -- GENERATE ARTIFACT BODY

Generate the mock body following the golden rubric structure for the selected skill.
The body must include:
  - All required section headings for the skill
  - Required tables or lists in the expected positions
  - Gate or verdict line where the skill produces one
  - Enforcement mechanisms in the expected positions

A reader familiar with the real skill must be able to identify which skill was mocked.
Generic prose without skill-specific structure fails.

---

STEP A-4 -- WRITE ARTIFACT

Write the complete artifact (header + warning + body) to:
  simulations/mock/{topic}-{namespace}-mock-{date}.md

Emit:
  > Artifact written: simulations/mock/{topic}-{namespace}-mock-{date}.md

---

STEP A-5 -- NEXT-STEP LINE

The final line of the artifact is:
  Next: /mock:review {topic} simulations/mock/{topic}-{namespace}-mock-{date}.md

Omit only if this skill was called from within a mock-review session to regenerate
a thin namespace.
```

## V-04 -- Output Format + Lifecycle Emphasis (Labeled ABD Clause + P-0 Forward Pointer)

**Axis**: Output format + lifecycle emphasis -- combines V-01's "Anti-bypass declaration
(ABD):" structural label at P-0 with V-02's forward pointer naming S-3 and A-1 as use
sites. Anti-bypass echo row labels become "(P-0, ABD)". No content attribution prefix
(V-03's axis not added). Both P-0's label and P-0's forward pointer are present; tests
whether the structural address pair -- a named anchor + bidirectional pointers -- is
sufficient without content-level attribution at the use sites.
**Hypothesis**: The label and forward pointer address two adjacent gaps at the definition
site: the label makes the back-reference precise (a reader arriving at P-0 finds the
named "Anti-bypass declaration (ABD):" heading and confirms the match), and the forward
pointer makes the pair complete at P-0 (P-0 names its use sites). Together they create a
navigable named anchor at P-0 that can be located from use sites and whose use sites can
be located from P-0. The absence of content attribution (V-03) tests whether the
structural pair alone closes both gaps without requiring the content cell to echo the
source independently.
**Predicts**: C-01 through C-47 (39 criteria); combines two axes that may jointly satisfy
the v17 aspirational target.
**Expected composite**: 39/39 * 10 = 10.0 (aspirational).

STEP P-0 -- CROSS-REFERENCE PROTOCOL

Token notation: bracket tokens in this run encode step and row type.

Anti-bypass declaration (ABD): An executor who processes a bracket token without reading
the Step and Row type cells has performed only Phase 1. An executor who performs Phase 1
without performing Phase 2 violates this protocol. Locate-only is a protocol failure.
Anti-bypass echo rows at S-3 and A-1 echo this declaration at each bracket-token row.

  Abbreviation key:
    :CS = Cross-site reference row
    :FC = Failure consequence row

  | Token    | Step | Row type                  | Paired token | Direction              |
  |----------|------|---------------------------|--------------|------------------------|
  | [S-3:CS] | S-3  | Cross-site reference row  | [A-1:FC]     | forward --> names A-1  |
  | [A-1:FC] | A-1  | Failure consequence row   | [S-3:CS]     | <-- backward, names S-3|

Lookup obligation: before processing any row containing a bracket token, look up the
token in the table above. P-0 table, row 1 = [S-3:CS]; P-0 table, row 2 = [A-1:FC].

Lookup protocol -- two phases, required before writing any bracket-token row:

  Phase 1 -- Locate: find the row in the table above by matching the token name.

  Phase 2 -- Confirm (four steps, in order):
    Step 2a: Read the Step cell.
    Step 2b: Read the Row type cell.
    Step 2c: Assert that the step name matches the step you are currently writing
             and that the row type name matches the role of this row in the chain.
    Step 2d: Emit confirmation record (use the pre-filled table block at the
             current use site; fill in the Match field only):
               Token: {token-name -- pre-filled at use site}
               Step: {step-name -- pre-filled at use site}
               Row type: {row-type-name -- pre-filled at use site}
               Match: PASS | FAIL
    DO NOT WRITE THE ROW until Steps 2a through 2d are complete and the record is
    emitted.

Do not re-establish this protocol in later steps. Every bracket token in this run is
interpreted and confirmed per this table.

Assemble the header block:

  [MOCK ARTIFACT -- NOT VERIFIED]
  Skill: {skill-id from S-1}
  Topic: {topic}
  Category: {CATEGORY from S-2}
  Date: {today's date}
  Status: MOCK (awaiting review)
  Flag: {FLAG from S-3 -- copied verbatim, not rederived}

The header appears immediately after any frontmatter. All six fields are present.
The header precedes all body content.

---

STEP A-2 -- FIDELITY WARNING

Write the fidelity warning as the first section of the artifact body. Position it
before any mock content. Separate from the header and from the body with ---
delimiters.

  EVIDENCE-HEAVY:
    WARNING: This is an EVIDENCE-HEAVY mock. The content below is structurally
    correct but evidentially fabricated. Do not use this output to draw conclusions
    about {topic}. The sections are right; the contents are invented. A real
    {skill-id} run is required before any evidence-based decision can be made
    from this namespace.

  MIXED:
    CAUTION: This is a MIXED mock. Structural elements (tables, gates, enforcement
    mechanisms) are reliable. Specific claims (competitor names, market data,
    research findings) may be partially accurate or partially fabricated. Review
    for plausibility before accepting coverage.

  HIGH-STRUCTURE:
    NOTE: This is a HIGH-STRUCTURE mock. The structure, sections, and enforcement
    mechanisms are reliable. Content is synthetically generated but structurally
    representative. Adequate for structural planning at Tier 1. REAL-REQUIRED at
    Tier 2+ for critical namespaces (trace, scout-feasibility, listen).

---

STEP A-3 -- GENERATE ARTIFACT BODY

Generate the mock body following the golden rubric structure for the selected skill.
The body must include:
  - All required section headings for the skill
  - Required tables or lists in the expected positions
  - Gate or verdict line where the skill produces one
  - Enforcement mechanisms in the expected positions

A reader familiar with the real skill must be able to identify which skill was mocked.
Generic prose without skill-specific structure fails.

---

STEP A-4 -- WRITE ARTIFACT

Write the complete artifact (header + warning + body) to:
  simulations/mock/{topic}-{namespace}-mock-{date}.md

Emit:
  > Artifact written: simulations/mock/{topic}-{namespace}-mock-{date}.md

---

STEP A-5 -- NEXT-STEP LINE

The final line of the artifact is:
  Next: /mock:review {topic} simulations/mock/{topic}-{namespace}-mock-{date}.md

Omit only if this skill was called from within a mock-review session to regenerate
a thin namespace.
```

## V-05 -- Full Convergence (Labeled ABD + Forward Pointer + Content Attribution; Seeds v18)

**Axis**: Full convergence -- combines V-01's "Anti-bypass declaration (ABD):" structural
label at P-0 (with forward pointer naming S-3 and A-1 as use sites), and V-03's content
attribution prefix "Per P-0, ABD: " in the Anti-bypass echo row content cell. Anti-bypass
echo row labels become "(P-0, ABD)". This creates a complete provenance chain: P-0's ABD
clause is named, knows its use sites, and each use site's echo cites the source in both
the row label and the content cell.
**Hypothesis**: No single-axis form tests all three properties together. V-05 tests whether
the complete chain -- labeled named anchor at the definition site, bidirectional navigation
at both ends, and content-level attribution at every use site -- produces reliably distinct
protocol identity markers at every point where the anti-bypass constraint appears. The
executor encounters the constraint as "Per P-0, ABD:" and can verify the source by
matching "(P-0, ABD)" in the row label to the "Anti-bypass declaration (ABD):" heading at
P-0.
**Predicts**: C-01 through C-47 (39 criteria; full score).
**Seeds v18 aspirational maximum**: The "(P-0, ABD)" row label uses a short-name reference.
The natural next step is bracket token notation: "[P-0:ABD]" as a structured token entered
in the P-0 resolution table, making the Anti-bypass declaration independently addressable
via the same O(1) lookup mechanism as [S-3:CS] and [A-1:FC]. v18 targets graduation of
this bracket token form to a pass condition, completing the token-based navigation chain
that spans both the cross-reference layer (S-3 <-> A-1) and the protocol definition layer
(P-0 ABD <-> use sites).
**Expected composite**: 39/39 * 10 = 10.0.

STEP P-0 -- CROSS-REFERENCE PROTOCOL

Token notation: bracket tokens in this run encode step and row type.

Anti-bypass declaration (ABD): An executor who processes a bracket token without reading
the Step and Row type cells has performed only Phase 1. An executor who performs Phase 1
without performing Phase 2 violates this protocol. Locate-only is a protocol failure.
Anti-bypass echo rows at S-3 and A-1 echo this declaration at each bracket-token row.

  Abbreviation key:
    :CS = Cross-site reference row
    :FC = Failure consequence row

  | Token    | Step | Row type                  | Paired token | Direction              |
  |----------|------|---------------------------|--------------|------------------------|
  | [S-3:CS] | S-3  | Cross-site reference row  | [A-1:FC]     | forward --> names A-1  |
  | [A-1:FC] | A-1  | Failure consequence row   | [S-3:CS]     | <-- backward, names S-3|

Lookup obligation: before processing any row containing a bracket token, look up the
token in the table above. P-0 table, row 1 = [S-3:CS]; P-0 table, row 2 = [A-1:FC].

Lookup protocol -- two phases, required before writing any bracket-token row:

  Phase 1 -- Locate: find the row in the table above by matching the token name.

  Phase 2 -- Confirm (four steps, in order):
    Step 2a: Read the Step cell.
    Step 2b: Read the Row type cell.
    Step 2c: Assert that the step name matches the step you are currently writing
             and that the row type name matches the role of this row in the chain.
    Step 2d: Emit confirmation record (use the pre-filled table block at the
             current use site; fill in the Match field only):
               Token: {token-name -- pre-filled at use site}
               Step: {step-name -- pre-filled at use site}
               Row type: {row-type-name -- pre-filled at use site}
               Match: PASS | FAIL
    DO NOT WRITE THE ROW until Steps 2a through 2d are complete and the record is
    emitted.

Do not re-establish this protocol in later steps. Every bracket token in this run is
interpreted and confirmed per this table.

STEP S-2 -- DETERMINE CATEGORY

  MIXED: scout-competitors, prove-hypothesis, review-customers, review-users

CATEGORY is now assigned. Do not modify it.

STEP S-3 -- COMPUTE FLAG

FLAG is computed exactly once in this step. It is a named variable.

Compute FLAG from CATEGORY and tier:

  Case 1 -- CATEGORY = HIGH-STRUCTURE AND skill is critical (trace-*, scout-feasibility,
            any listen-*) AND tier >= 2:
    FLAG = "none (structural coverage reliable; REAL-REQUIRED at Tier 2+)"

  Case 2 -- CATEGORY = HIGH-STRUCTURE (all other cases):
    FLAG = "none (structural coverage reliable)"

  Case 3 -- CATEGORY = EVIDENCE-HEAVY:
    FLAG = "REAL-REQUIRED (evidence-heavy -- real {skill-id} run needed)"

  Case 4 -- CATEGORY = MIXED:
    FLAG = "REVIEW-FOR-PLAUSIBILITY"

  Compliance override -- check last, applied regardless of case above:
    If compliance tags are present in TOPICS.md AND skill is scout-compliance or
    trace-permissions (any tier, any category):
    FLAG = "REAL-REQUIRED (compliance-sensitive)"

  | Field      | Value                          |
  |------------|--------------------------------|
  | Token      | [A-1:FC]                       |
  | Step       | A-1                            |

Assemble the header block:

  [MOCK ARTIFACT -- NOT VERIFIED]
  Skill: {skill-id from S-1}
  Topic: {topic}
  Category: {CATEGORY from S-2}
  Date: {today's date}
  Status: MOCK (awaiting review)
  Flag: {FLAG from S-3 -- copied verbatim, not rederived}

The header appears immediately after any frontmatter. All six fields are present.
The header precedes all body content.

STEP A-2 -- FIDELITY WARNING

Write the fidelity warning as the first section of the artifact body. Position it
before any mock content. Separate from the header and from the body with ---
delimiters.

  EVIDENCE-HEAVY:
    WARNING: This is an EVIDENCE-HEAVY mock. The content below is structurally
    correct but evidentially fabricated. Do not use this output to draw conclusions
    about {topic}. The sections are right; the contents are invented. A real
    {skill-id} run is required before any evidence-based decision can be made
    from this namespace.

  MIXED:
    CAUTION: This is a MIXED mock. Structural elements (tables, gates, enforcement
    mechanisms) are reliable. Specific claims (competitor names, market data,
    research findings) may be partially accurate or partially fabricated. Review
    for plausibility before accepting coverage.

  HIGH-STRUCTURE:
    NOTE: This is a HIGH-STRUCTURE mock. The structure, sections, and enforcement
    mechanisms are reliable. Content is synthetically generated but structurally
    representative. Adequate for structural planning at Tier 1. REAL-REQUIRED at
    Tier 2+ for critical namespaces (trace, scout-feasibility, listen).

---

STEP A-3 -- GENERATE ARTIFACT BODY

Generate the mock body following the golden rubric structure for the selected skill.
The body must include:
  - All required section headings for the skill
  - Required tables or lists in the expected positions
  - Gate or verdict line where the skill produces one
  - Enforcement mechanisms in the expected positions

A reader familiar with the real skill must be able to identify which skill was mocked.
Generic prose without skill-specific structure fails.

---

STEP A-4 -- WRITE ARTIFACT

Write the complete artifact (header + warning + body) to:
  simulations/mock/{topic}-{namespace}-mock-{date}.md

Emit:
  > Artifact written: simulations/mock/{topic}-{namespace}-mock-{date}.md

---

STEP A-5 -- NEXT-STEP LINE

The final line of the artifact is:
  Next: /mock:review {topic} simulations/mock/{topic}-{namespace}-mock-{date}.md

Omit only if this skill was called from within a mock-review session to regenerate
a thin namespace.
