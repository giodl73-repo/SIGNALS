# Variate R13 -- corps-rob

5 complete prompt body variations for the `corps-rob` skill.
Single-axis variations first (V-01 through V-03), then combinations (V-04, V-05).

R13 focus: v13 adds C-41 (RULE AUDIT-TABLE Named Anti-Pattern Declaration) and C-42 (Glossary
Exclusivity Named-Criterion Enumeration). Retroactive R12 scoring shows V-02 at 245/260 (C-41
pass via named anti-pattern; C-42 not scoreable: C-40 FAIL). V-01 at 240/260 (C-40 pass via
exclusivity declaration; C-42 FAIL: no criterion enumeration; C-41 not scoreable: C-35 FAIL).

**C-41** (RULE AUDIT-TABLE Named Anti-Pattern Declaration): C-35 must pass (additive constraint
declared). Then RULE AUDIT-TABLE must additionally name the failure mode as a labeled
anti-pattern, citing C-29 as the criterion voided. R12 V-02 satisfies C-41; R12 V-01 cannot
score it (C-35 FAIL). The anti-pattern closes the gap between the positive additive constraint
and the adjacent wrong implementation (table-as-replacement) that the positive constraint alone
leaves unguarded.

**C-42** (Glossary Exclusivity Named-Criterion Enumeration): C-40 must pass (generic exclusivity
declaration). Then the declaration must additionally enumerate C-30 (preamble schema citation)
and C-34 (disambiguation annotation) or equivalents by label. No R12 variation achieves this.
V-01 passes C-40 (generic exclusivity language) but names no specific criteria. The enumeration
makes the exclusivity declaration self-documenting: a generator encounters the explicit list of
criteria that require glossary scope and cannot claim satisfaction by inlining any of them.

Three R13 single-axis variations:

- **C-42 Criterion Enumeration** (V-01): Extend R12 V-01's glossary exclusivity preamble to
  enumerate C-30 and C-34 by label inline in the exclusivity declaration. All other elements
  identical to R12 V-01. Tests: does named-criterion enumeration added to an existing C-40-
  passing preamble produce a C-42 pass without breaking any other criterion?

- **C-35 + C-41 Preserved Clean** (V-02): Reproduce R12 V-02's RULE AUDIT-TABLE additive
  constraint and named anti-pattern as a clean isolated single-axis test. No glossary exclusivity
  declaration (C-40 intentionally absent). Tests: is C-41 reliably achievable as a standalone
  single-axis change from the R12 V-02 base, with no interaction effects?

- **Imperative-Register C-42 with GLOSSARY-GOVERNED CRITERIA Block** (V-03): Replace R12 V-01's
  inline criterion list in the preamble with a dedicated GLOSSARY-GOVERNED CRITERIA block using
  SHALL NOT / MUST language throughout. Tests: does a stronger phrasing register and dedicated
  block structure for the criterion enumeration produce a more reliable C-42 signal than inline
  enumeration, while leaving all other criteria stable?

## Variation Axes Selected

| Axis | Used In | Target Criteria |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| C-42 Inline Criterion Enumeration | V-01 | C-42 |
| C-35 + C-41 Clean Reproduction | V-02 | C-35 + C-41 |
| Imperative-Register + GLOSSARY-GOVERNED CRITERIA Block | V-03 | C-42 (alt approach) |
| C-42 + C-35 + C-41 Combined | V-04 | C-40 + C-42 + C-35 + C-41 |
| Full Convergence + IB-URGENCY-CASCADE Named Rule | V-05 | 260/260 target |

---

## V-01 -- C-42 Criterion Enumeration

**Axis**: Extend R12 V-01's glossary exclusivity preamble with named-criterion enumeration.
The exclusivity declaration already states the glossary is the exclusive locus for named-rule
requirements. V-01 adds the enumeration: C-30 (preamble schema citation) and C-34 (disambiguation
annotation) are explicitly named as the criteria whose satisfaction requires glossary scope.
All other elements identical to R12 V-01: dimensional dual baselines (IB-01 technical,
IB-02 organizational), RULE CARRY-FORWARD with Inertia ID column, full glossary including
RULE AUDIT-TABLE without additive constraint.
**Hypothesis**: R12 V-01 passes C-40 with generic exclusivity language. C-42 requires the same
declaration to name C-30 and C-34 (or equivalents) by label. The addition is a criterion-list
sentence in the existing exclusivity preamble. Prediction: all R12 V-01 criteria hold; C-42
is newly satisfied; C-35 still fails (RULE AUDIT-TABLE has no additive constraint); C-41 not
scoreable (C-35 FAIL). Expected score under v13: 245/260.

**STAGES (default order):** leadership -> teams -> pm -> tpm -> arch-board -> spire

Flags:
- `--stage [name]` -- run one stage only
- `--stage all` -- run full sequence
- `--scope [group]` -- restrict `.roles/` to this division or tribe

**SETUP**

1. Read `org.yaml` -- identify the role assigned to each stage.
2. Read `.roles/` -- load `orientation.frame` and `lens.primary` for each role.
3. Fallback if files absent: assign by stage name.

**RUN-LEVEL RULE GLOSSARY**

This glossary is the **exclusive locus** for named format rule declarations in this run.
Named-rule requirements **cannot be satisfied by inline rule declarations** in stage templates
or section bodies. The following criteria are specifically restricted to glossary-scope
declarations: **C-30** (Run-Level Preamble Schema with Named Post-Stage Reference) is satisfied
only by schema declarations appearing in this glossary before any stage output begins, with
post-stage sections referencing the schema by name -- an inline schema co-located with a
post-stage audit section does not satisfy C-30. **C-34** (Conditional Item vs Condition Enum
Disambiguation) is satisfied only by a disambiguation annotation on RULE CONDITIONAL-ITEM
appearing in this glossary -- an inline annotation in a stage verdict block does not satisfy
C-34. A rule declared only inline does not constitute a named-rule declaration for rubric
purposes. Post-stage sections reference rules by glossary name (e.g., `[RULE AUDIT-SUITE
applies -- see glossary]`) rather than redeclaring conditions inline.

```
RULE INERTIA-BASELINE
  Governs: Dual baseline blocks IB-01 (technical) + IB-02 (organizational) before Stage 1

    Inertia Impact / Escalated To / Acknowledged By / Resolved By / Resolution
  Anti-pattern: Cross-stage LID citations without initialized shared ledger
  Violation: VIOLATION-11

RULE CARRY-FORWARD
  Governs: Per-stage CARRY FORWARD block before first finding in multi-stage runs
  Structural element: Table (From Stage / LID / Summary / Inertia ID / Action) or CARRY: NONE
  Inertia ID column: tags each carried finding IB-01 / IB-02 / IB-01+IB-02 / N/A

  Violation: VIOLATION-12

RULE VIA-POSITION

  Governs: Stage entry and exit conditions
  Structural element: Named ENTRY: / EXIT: fields citing specific LIDs or artifact names
  Anti-pattern: Generic language ("all inputs ready", "stage complete") not falsifiable
  Violation: VIOLATION-05

RULE CONDITIONAL-ITEM [governs conditional verdicts -- distinct from RULE CONDITION-ENUM]
  Governs: Conditional verdict items under APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS
  Structural element: Numbered items -- (1) what must happen, (2) owner by role title,
    (3) LID driving the condition
  Anti-pattern-1: Conditions stated only in prose rationale without numbered enumeration
  Anti-pattern-2: Using (a)/(b)/(c) audit-schema enumeration for verdict conditions
    [RULE CONDITIONAL-ITEM uses 1/2/3 numbered items; RULE CONDITION-ENUM uses (a)/(b)/(c)
     labeled conditions -- structurally distinct constructs governing different artifacts;
     not interchangeable]

RULE CONDITION-ENUM
  Governs: AUDIT RESULT blocks in post-stage audit sections
  Structural element: Per-condition enumeration (a)/(b)/(c) mirroring the named audit schema
  Anti-pattern: Single aggregate "NONE" or "CLEAN" replacing per-condition enumeration

RULE AUDIT-TABLE
  Governs: Structured table layer in enforcement audit sections
  Structural element: Named-column table (Stage / Pre-Commitment / Honored / Deviation)
  Anti-pattern: Table without per-condition AUDIT RESULT block beneath it

RULE AUDIT-SUITE
  Governs: Multi-type post-stage audit section set
  Structural element: Three independent sections with distinct pre-commitment scopes
  Anti-pattern-1: Merged section covering multiple dimensions does not satisfy
  Anti-pattern-2: Same pre-commitment dimension repeated three times does not satisfy
  Note: SYNTHESIS does not count toward this suite -- see RULE SYNTHESIS below

RULE BOOKEND-AUDIT
  Governs: Mandatory gap-scan sections (ROLE CONCERN AUDIT, TRIAGE NOTE AUDIT)
  Rule: Absence is a FORMAT VIOLATION even on clean runs
  Anti-pattern: Omitting the section when no gaps exist

RULE ZERO-STATE
  Governs: All audit, enforcement, and gap-check sections reporting no violations
  Rule: Silence is not clean -- explicit zero-state required
  Structural element: VIOLATIONS: NONE / GAPS: NONE / (a) NONE per-condition enumeration

RULE SYNTHESIS
  Governs: SYNTHESIS section identity, non-audit status, and required subsections
  Identity: SYNTHESIS is a cross-stage analytical artifact -- NOT an audit section
  Rule: Does NOT count toward RULE AUDIT-SUITE's three required sections
  Required subsections (5 -- absence of any is VIOLATION-13):
    1. BLOCKERS -- all named BLOCKER entries; zero-state: "No blockers identified."
    2. CROSS-CUTTING THEMES SUMMARY -- document-level themes with stage sources
    3. RESIDUAL OPEN ITEMS -- FINDING LEDGER rows where Acknowledged By = blank
    4. DUAL-DIRECTION CHECK -- every finding with Escalated To filled
    5. INERTIA PRESSURE SUMMARY -- separate assessment of IB-01 (technical displacement)
       and IB-02 (organizational adoption resistance); rate each HIGH / MED / LOW;
       combined implication for go/no-go; reference both by IB-ID
  Anti-pattern: Using SYNTHESIS as a RULE AUDIT-SUITE section substitute
  Violation: VIOLATION-13
```

**TRIAGE NOTE AUDIT SCHEMA** [declared here -- post-stage TRIAGE NOTE AUDIT sections reference
this schema by name rather than redeclaring conditions inline]:

```
(a) Absent Triage Note section in stage
(b) Missing named field (HIGH DRIVER / LOW ANCHOR / DISTRIBUTION FACTOR)
(c) Placeholder or non-substantive field content
```

---

**DUAL INERTIA BASELINES -- REQUIRED BEFORE STAGE 1** [RULE INERTIA-BASELINE applies -- see glossary]

```
## INERTIA BASELINES

### IB-01 -- Technical Displacement Baseline

IB-ID:            IB-01
Status-Quo:       [name the artifact, system, or API contract this topic displaces]
Incumbent Forces: [teams or services with hard technical dependencies on the current system]
Displacement Cost:[migration effort, breaking changes, or re-integration required -- specific]
Validity Window:  [date or event after which this baseline should be re-assessed]

### IB-02 -- Organizational Adoption Baseline

IB-ID:            IB-02
Adopted Behavior: [specific workflow, habit, or convention the new approach disrupts]
Resistance Source:[team or role most likely to resist -- and why, specifically]
Adoption Cost:    [retraining, tooling change, or process redesign required -- specific]
Validity Window:  [date or event after which this baseline should be re-assessed]
```

Every downstream structural position references the appropriate baseline by ID:
- Inertia Impact in finding ledger rows: IB-01 / IB-02 / IB-01+IB-02 / N/A
- Inertia ID in carry forward rows: IB-01 / IB-02 / IB-01+IB-02 / N/A
- Inertia Link in risk register entries: IB-01 / IB-02 / both / N/A
- Inertia Pressure Summary in synthesis: assess each baseline separately

| LID | Stage | Via | Severity | Finding Summary | Inertia Impact | Escalated To | Acknowledged By | Resolved By | Resolution |
|-----|-------|-----|----------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|------------|

---

**STAGE DOCUMENT FORMAT:**

```
## Stage: [stage-name]

ROLE: [name] | Frame: [orientation.frame from .roles/] | Lens: [lens.primary]

### Carry Forward [RULE CARRY-FORWARD applies -- see glossary]

| From Stage | LID | Summary | Inertia ID | Action |
|------------|-----|---------|------------|--------|
[entries or: CARRY: NONE]

### Phase Gate [RULE PHASE-GATE applies -- see glossary]

ENTRY: [specific named condition -- cite artifact, LID, or carry block entry; not generic]
EXIT:  [what this stage certifies as resolved -- cite at least one LID from this stage]

### Calibration Block

ROLE LENS: [what this role most fears for this specific topic -- topic-specific;
            references the artifact or domain under review; not a generic role description]

HIGH DRIVER:         [concern ranked highest severity in this stage -- why]
LOW ANCHOR:          [concern ranked lowest severity in this stage -- why]
DISTRIBUTION FACTOR: [what shaped the severity spread across this stage's findings]

### Triage Note

HIGH DRIVER:         [concern driving HIGH assignment -- why this concern outranks others]
LOW ANCHOR:          [concern anchoring LOW assignment -- why this concern is least critical]
DISTRIBUTION FACTOR: [what shaped the severity spread -- blast radius, reversibility, timeline]

### Findings [RULE VIA-POSITION applies -- see glossary]

Append each row to the Finding Ledger as you write it.

| LID | Via | Severity | Finding | Inertia Impact | Owner | Resolution |
|-----|-----|----------|---------|----------------|-------|------------|
| [stage]-L-01 | [lens item] | HIGH | [concern grounded in this role's Frame] | [IB-01/IB-02/IB-01+IB-02/N/A] | [role] | [action] |
| [stage]-L-02 | [lens item] | MED  | [concern from this role's domain]        | [IB-01/IB-02/IB-01+IB-02/N/A] | [role] | [action] |

[minimum 2 findings per stage; severity must vary; Via: is the SECOND column per RULE VIA-POSITION;
 Inertia Impact: IB-01, IB-02, IB-01+IB-02, or N/A -- no blank cells]

[For carried items: Inherits: [stage] [LID] -- escalate / confirm / contradict -- one sentence.
 Then update the FINDING LEDGER row: Resolved By + Resolution if this stage closes it.]

### Verdict [RULE CONDITIONAL-ITEM applies -- see glossary]

| Status | Rationale | Finding-IDs | Conditions |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| APPROVED / APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS / BLOCKED / DEFERRED | [one sentence citing LID] | [LID refs] | [numbered or N/A] |
```

**TPM STAGE -- ADDITIONAL REQUIRED SECTIONS:**

After findings, before verdict:

```
### Risk Register

| ID   | Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation | Inertia Link | Status |
|------|------|----------|------------|------------|--------------|--------|
| R-01 | [risk] | HIGH | HIGH | [mitigation] | IB-01 | OPEN  |
| R-02 | [risk] | MED  | MED  | [mitigation] | IB-02 | OPEN  |
| R-03 | [risk] | LOW  | LOW  | [mitigation] | N/A   | WATCH |

[minimum 3 rows; at least 1 HIGH; Status: OPEN / WATCH / MITIGATED, >= 2 distinct values;
 Inertia Link: IB-01, IB-02, both, or N/A for each row -- no blank cells;
 at least one IB-01 row and at least one IB-02 row]

### Risk Register Update Protocol

| Field           | Value |
|-----------------|-------|
| Trigger Events  | [2-3 specific events -- topic-specific, not generic] |
| Owner Role      | [role title -- not person name] |
| Revisit Cadence | [schedule or trigger condition specific to this topic] |

### Go/No-Go

| Verdict | Rationale | Risk Refs |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| GO / NO-GO / GO WITH CONDITIONS | [one sentence citing risk] | [R-NN refs] |

[If GO WITH CONDITIONS: numbered items -- (1) what, (2) owner by role title, (3) risk ID]
```

**ARCH-BOARD STAGE:**

Entry condition must reference at least one tpm risk ID (R-NN) or finding LID.
`Inherits: tpm [LID or R-NN] -- escalate / confirm / contradict`

**SPIRE STAGE -- REQUIRED SECTION:**

```
### Mission Cascade

| S-Office Mission | Program | Artifact/Topic | Alignment |
|-----------------|---------|----------------|-----------|
| [named mission] | [program] | [topic] | ALIGNED / PARTIAL / GAP |

[minimum 1 row; named mission required -- "strategic goals" fails C-08]
[For PARTIAL or GAP: one sentence below the table explaining the misalignment]
```

**CROSS-CUTTING THEMES**

When the same concern surfaces in 2+ distinct stages, elevate at the document level:

```
## Cross-Cutting Theme: [Theme Name]
Surfaced in: [stage-1], [stage-2] (+ additional stages)
Severity escalation: [why repetition across stages increases priority]
Primary owner: [role title]
```

VIOLATION-08 if a cross-cutting theme is named only within one stage's findings.

**BLOCKER PROTOCOL**

```
BLOCKER: [upstream stage] [LID] blocks [downstream stage]: [impact -- one sentence]
```

Minimum 1 named blocker per full run. VIOLATION-06 if downstream stage does not acknowledge by LID.

**DUAL-DIRECTION TRACEABILITY**

Sending: `Escalates: [LID] -> [downstream stage] -- [one sentence]`
Receiving: `Inherits: [stage] [LID] -- escalate / confirm / contradict`

At least 1 finding must have both records. CARRY FORWARD is the aggregate handoff;
Inherits: is the per-finding confirmation.

**RETROACTIVE INVALIDATION**

```
INVALIDATION: [upstream stage] verdict affected by [LID]: [reason -- one sentence]
Required action: [action]
```

VIOLATION-07 if an upstream verdict is overturned without a named INVALIDATION record.

**SYNTHESIS -- REQUIRED AFTER ALL STAGES** [RULE SYNTHESIS applies -- see glossary]

```
## Synthesis

[RULE SYNTHESIS: cross-stage analytical artifact. NOT an audit section. Does NOT count toward
 RULE AUDIT-SUITE. VIOLATION-13 if used as substitute or if any required subsection is absent.
 Five required subsections:]

### Blockers
[All BLOCKER entries from the full run. For each: upstream stage, LID, downstream stage, impact.
 If none: "No blockers identified."]

### Cross-Cutting Themes Summary
[All document-level themes. For each: stage list, severity escalation note, primary owner.
 If none: "No cross-cutting themes identified."]

### Residual Open Items
| Originating Stage | LID | Intended Receiving Stage | Gap |
|-------------------|-----|--------------------------|-----|
[Every FINDING LEDGER row where Acknowledged By = blank. If none: "No residual open items."]

### Dual-Direction Check
| LID | Sent By | Escalates To | Acknowledged By | Acknowledged As |
|-----|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
[Complete for every finding with Escalated To filled. Acknowledged By = "--" if unacknowledged.]

### Inertia Pressure Summary

**IB-01 (Technical Displacement)**
[All FINDING LEDGER rows with Inertia Impact = IB-01 or IB-01+IB-02. All risk register rows
 with Inertia Link = IB-01 or both. Rate aggregate technical displacement pressure: HIGH / MED / LOW.
 State what migration resistance means for go/no-go readiness.]

**IB-02 (Organizational Adoption Resistance)**
[All FINDING LEDGER rows with Inertia Impact = IB-02 or IB-01+IB-02. All risk register rows
 with Inertia Link = IB-02 or both. Rate aggregate adoption resistance pressure: HIGH / MED / LOW.
 State what behavioral resistance means for rollout readiness.]

**Combined**
[What both pressure vectors together mean for go/no-go readiness.]
```

**POST-STAGE AUDIT SUITE** [RULE AUDIT-SUITE applies -- see glossary]

| [stage] | yes/no | [entries or CARRY: NONE] | present/absent | yes/no/n-a | [note or NONE] |

CARRY FORWARD GAPS: [named gaps or NONE]
```

**VIOLATION TAXONOMY**

[All named format rules are declared in the RUN-LEVEL RULE GLOSSARY above.]

VIOLATION-01: Stage lacks a labeled header.
*Consequence*: Cross-stage references by stage name cannot resolve to a stable document anchor.

VIOLATION-02: Via: field absent from the finding row schema entirely.
*Consequence*: Lens attribution has no structural home; coverage depends on active recall.

VIOLATION-03: Via: cell present but blank or placeholder.
*Consequence*: False confidence in lens coverage.

VIOLATION-04: Stage verdict expressed as prose -- Status / Rationale / Finding-IDs not in named columns.
*Consequence*: Status, Rationale, or Finding-IDs can be omitted without a structural gap.

VIOLATION-05: Phase gate uses generic readiness language without citing a specific LID or artifact.
*Consequence*: Gate cannot be falsified against findings; stage can declare exit with HIGH findings open.

VIOLATION-06: Downstream stage does not acknowledge upstream escalation by LID.
*Consequence*: No audit trail for whether the upstream concern was considered.

VIOLATION-07: Upstream verdict overturned without a named INVALIDATION record.
*Consequence*: Document presents two authoritative states with no reconciliation path.

VIOLATION-08: Cross-cutting theme elevated only within a single stage's findings.
*Consequence*: Aggregate severity signal is never surfaced to the go/no-go decision.

VIOLATION-09: Technical displacement concerns raised without IB-01 before Stage 1.
*Consequence*: Technical inertia assertions are self-contained with no shared reference anchor.

VIOLATION-10: Organizational adoption resistance concerns raised without IB-02 before Stage 1.
*Consequence*: Behavioral resistance findings collapse into IB-01; migration cost and behavior
change cannot be distinguished.

VIOLATION-10a: Via: not positioned as second column in finding table.
*Consequence*: Lens-coverage enforcement degrades from structural to instructional.

VIOLATION-11: Cross-stage citations produced without FINDING LEDGER initialized.
*Consequence*: Dual-direction traceability cannot be independently verified.

VIOLATION-12: Stage lacks labeled CARRY FORWARD block before its first finding.
*Consequence*: Inter-stage handoff undocumented as a structural artifact.

VIOLATION-13: SYNTHESIS used as a RULE AUDIT-SUITE section substitute; or any required
SYNTHESIS subsection absent.
*Consequence*: Counting SYNTHESIS toward RULE AUDIT-SUITE reduces required distinct audit
dimensions from three to two.

[Current series: VIOLATION-01 through VIOLATION-13.]

## V-02 -- C-35 + C-41 Named Anti-Pattern Clean Reproduction

**Axis**: Reproduce R12 V-02's C-35 (additive constraint on RULE AUDIT-TABLE) and C-41 (named
anti-pattern in RULE AUDIT-TABLE) as a clean isolated single-axis test. The glossary preamble
is intentionally generic (no exclusivity declaration -- C-40 absent) to isolate RULE AUDIT-TABLE
changes from glossary preamble changes. All other elements identical to R12 V-02: dimensional
dual baselines (IB-01 technical, IB-02 organizational), RULE CARRY-FORWARD with Inertia ID
column, full glossary.
**Hypothesis**: R12 V-02 achieves C-35 via the additive constraint and C-41 via the named
anti-pattern "Table that replaces the AUDIT RESULT block, silently dropping C-29." This is an
isolated single-axis test verifying C-41 is reliably achievable without C-40 interaction effects.
Prediction: all R12 V-02 criteria hold; C-35 PASS; C-41 PASS; C-40 FAIL (intentional); C-42
not scoreable (C-40 FAIL). Expected score under v13: 245/260.

**RUN-LEVEL RULE GLOSSARY**

All named format rules for this run are declared here before any stage output. Post-stage
sections reference rules by glossary name rather than redeclaring conditions inline.
Inline re-declaration of a rule already in the glossary creates inconsistency risk.

RULE CONDITION-ENUM
  Governs: AUDIT RESULT blocks in post-stage audit sections
  Structural element: Per-condition enumeration (a)/(b)/(c) mirroring the named audit schema
  Anti-pattern: Single aggregate "NONE" or "CLEAN" replacing per-condition enumeration

RULE AUDIT-TABLE
  Governs: Structured table layer in enforcement audit sections
  Structural element: Named-column table (Stage / Pre-Commitment / Honored / Deviation)
    inserted ABOVE the AUDIT RESULT block -- NOT replacing it
  Additive constraint: The table is a new layer above an existing artifact. Adding the table
    does NOT void RULE CONDITION-ENUM. The AUDIT RESULT block with per-condition (a)/(b)/(c)
    enumeration is preserved BENEATH the table and is mandatory regardless of table presence.
    Presence of the table does not substitute for the AUDIT RESULT block; both must coexist.
  Anti-pattern: Table that replaces the AUDIT RESULT block, silently dropping C-29's
    per-condition enumeration

RULE AUDIT-SUITE
  Governs: Multi-type post-stage audit section set
  Structural element: Three independent sections with distinct pre-commitment scopes
  Anti-pattern-1: Merged section covering multiple dimensions does not satisfy
  Anti-pattern-2: Same pre-commitment dimension repeated three times does not satisfy
  Note: SYNTHESIS does not count toward this suite -- see RULE SYNTHESIS below

RULE BOOKEND-AUDIT
  Governs: Mandatory gap-scan sections (ROLE CONCERN AUDIT, TRIAGE NOTE AUDIT)
  Rule: Absence is a FORMAT VIOLATION even on clean runs
  Anti-pattern: Omitting the section when no gaps exist

RULE ZERO-STATE
  Governs: All audit, enforcement, and gap-check sections reporting no violations
  Rule: Silence is not clean -- explicit zero-state required
  Structural element: VIOLATIONS: NONE / GAPS: NONE / (a) NONE per-condition enumeration

RULE SYNTHESIS
  Governs: SYNTHESIS section identity, non-audit status, and required subsections
  Identity: SYNTHESIS is a cross-stage analytical artifact -- NOT an audit section
  Rule: Does NOT count toward RULE AUDIT-SUITE's three required sections
  Required subsections (5 -- absence of any is VIOLATION-13):

**TRIAGE NOTE AUDIT SCHEMA** [declared here -- post-stage TRIAGE NOTE AUDIT sections reference
this schema by name rather than redeclaring conditions inline]:

**DUAL INERTIA BASELINES -- REQUIRED BEFORE STAGE 1** [RULE INERTIA-BASELINE applies -- see glossary]

```
## INERTIA BASELINES

### IB-01 -- Technical Displacement Baseline

IB-ID:            IB-01
Status-Quo:       [name the artifact, system, or API contract this topic displaces]
Incumbent Forces: [teams or services with hard technical dependencies on the current system]
Displacement Cost:[migration effort, breaking changes, or re-integration required -- specific]
Validity Window:  [date or event after which this baseline should be re-assessed]

### IB-02 -- Organizational Adoption Baseline

IB-ID:            IB-02
Adopted Behavior: [specific workflow, habit, or convention the new approach disrupts]
Resistance Source:[team or role most likely to resist -- and why, specifically]
Adoption Cost:    [retraining, tooling change, or process redesign required -- specific]
Validity Window:  [date or event after which this baseline should be re-assessed]
```

Every downstream structural position references the appropriate baseline by ID:
- Inertia Impact in finding ledger rows: IB-01 / IB-02 / IB-01+IB-02 / N/A
- Inertia ID in carry forward rows: IB-01 / IB-02 / IB-01+IB-02 / N/A
- Inertia Link in risk register entries: IB-01 / IB-02 / both / N/A
- Inertia Pressure Summary in synthesis: assess each baseline separately

### Triage Note

HIGH DRIVER:         [concern driving HIGH assignment -- why this concern outranks others]

**CARRY FORWARD AUDIT and VIOLATION TAXONOMY:** Same format as V-01.
VIOLATION-01 through VIOLATION-13 definitions identical.

---

## V-03 -- Imperative-Register C-42 with GLOSSARY-GOVERNED CRITERIA Block

**Axis**: Replace R12 V-01's inline criterion enumeration approach with a dedicated structured
block: GLOSSARY-GOVERNED CRITERIA. The block uses SHALL NOT / MUST language throughout and
appears as a named section of the glossary preamble rather than as inline sentences. This tests
a different phrasing register and block structure for C-42 -- the hypothesis is that a
separately labeled block with imperative language produces more reliable C-42 signal than
inline enumeration, because the block structure makes the criterion list a first-class artifact
rather than a qualifying clause. All other elements identical to R12 V-01.
**Hypothesis**: C-42 requires the exclusivity declaration to enumerate C-30 and C-34 by label.
The inline approach in V-01 weaves the enumeration into the preamble prose. The GLOSSARY-
GOVERNED CRITERIA block approach makes the enumeration a machine-scannable labeled section with
entries, closer to the tabular format of the rule glossary itself. Both approaches satisfy the
criterion text, but the block approach may be more reliably recognized. Prediction: C-40 PASS
(exclusivity declaration present); C-42 PASS (criterion enumeration present as labeled block);
C-35 FAIL (no additive constraint on RULE AUDIT-TABLE); C-41 not scoreable (C-35 FAIL).
Expected score under v13: 245/260.

**RUN-LEVEL RULE GLOSSARY**

This glossary is the **exclusive locus** for named format rule declarations in this run.
Named-rule requirements **SHALL NOT** be satisfied by inline rule declarations in stage
templates, section headers, or section bodies. A rule declared only at an application site
does not constitute a named-rule declaration for rubric purposes.

**GLOSSARY-GOVERNED CRITERIA** -- the following criteria are satisfied ONLY by declarations
appearing in this glossary before stage output begins:

```
C-30 (Run-Level Preamble Schema with Named Post-Stage Reference)
  MUST: Schema declarations appear in this glossary before any stage output.
  MUST: Post-stage audit sections reference the schema by name (e.g., "preamble declaration
        applies"), not by restating conditions inline.
  SHALL NOT: A schema co-located with a post-stage audit section (inside the section header
             or body) satisfy C-30 -- structural separation between declaration and application
             is required.

C-34 (Conditional Item vs Condition Enum Disambiguation)
  MUST: Disambiguation annotation on RULE CONDITIONAL-ITEM appear in this glossary, declaring
        the rule explicitly distinct from RULE CONDITION-ENUM.
  SHALL NOT: An inline annotation added to a stage verdict block satisfy C-34 -- the annotation
             must be a glossary-level rule declaration to satisfy the criterion.
```

Post-stage sections reference rules by glossary name rather than redeclaring conditions inline.

```
RULE INERTIA-BASELINE
  Governs: Dual baseline blocks IB-01 (technical) + IB-02 (organizational) before Stage 1
  Structural element IB-01: IB-ID / Status-Quo / Incumbent Forces / Displacement Cost /
    Validity Window
  Structural element IB-02: IB-ID / Adopted Behavior / Resistance Source / Adoption Cost /
    Validity Window
  Anti-pattern: Raising inertia concerns without both baselines before Stage 1
  Violation-09: Technical displacement concerns without IB-01
  Violation-10: Organizational adoption resistance concerns without IB-02

RULE FINDING-LEDGER
  Governs: FINDING LEDGER initialized before Stage 1
  Structural element: LID-indexed table with Stage / Via / Severity / Finding Summary /

  Anti-pattern: Cross-stage LID citations without initialized shared ledger
  Violation: VIOLATION-11

RULE CARRY-FORWARD

  Violation: VIOLATION-05

RULE CONDITIONAL-ITEM [governs conditional verdicts -- distinct from RULE CONDITION-ENUM]
  Governs: Conditional verdict items under APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS
  Structural element: Numbered items -- (1) what must happen, (2) owner by role title,
    (3) LID driving the condition
  Anti-pattern-1: Conditions stated only in prose rationale without numbered enumeration
  Anti-pattern-2: Using (a)/(b)/(c) audit-schema enumeration for verdict conditions
    [RULE CONDITIONAL-ITEM uses 1/2/3 numbered items; RULE CONDITION-ENUM uses (a)/(b)/(c)
     labeled conditions -- structurally distinct constructs governing different artifacts;
     not interchangeable]

RULE CONDITION-ENUM
  Governs: AUDIT RESULT blocks in post-stage audit sections
  Structural element: Per-condition enumeration (a)/(b)/(c) mirroring the named audit schema
  Anti-pattern: Single aggregate "NONE" or "CLEAN" replacing per-condition enumeration

RULE AUDIT-TABLE
  Governs: Structured table layer in enforcement audit sections
  Structural element: Named-column table (Stage / Pre-Commitment / Honored / Deviation)
  Anti-pattern: Table without per-condition AUDIT RESULT block beneath it

RULE AUDIT-SUITE
  Governs: Multi-type post-stage audit section set
  Structural element: Three independent sections with distinct pre-commitment scopes
  Anti-pattern-1: Merged section covering multiple dimensions does not satisfy
  Anti-pattern-2: Same pre-commitment dimension repeated three times does not satisfy
  Note: SYNTHESIS does not count toward this suite -- see RULE SYNTHESIS below

RULE BOOKEND-AUDIT
  Governs: Mandatory gap-scan sections (ROLE CONCERN AUDIT, TRIAGE NOTE AUDIT)
  Rule: Absence is a FORMAT VIOLATION even on clean runs
  Anti-pattern: Omitting the section when no gaps exist

RULE ZERO-STATE
  Governs: All audit, enforcement, and gap-check sections reporting no violations
  Rule: Silence is not clean -- explicit zero-state required
  Structural element: VIOLATIONS: NONE / GAPS: NONE / (a) NONE per-condition enumeration

RULE SYNTHESIS
  Governs: SYNTHESIS section identity, non-audit status, and required subsections
  Identity: SYNTHESIS is a cross-stage analytical artifact -- NOT an audit section
  Rule: Does NOT count toward RULE AUDIT-SUITE's three required sections
  Required subsections (5 -- absence of any is VIOLATION-13):
    1. BLOCKERS -- all named BLOCKER entries; zero-state: "No blockers identified."
    2. CROSS-CUTTING THEMES SUMMARY -- document-level themes with stage sources
    3. RESIDUAL OPEN ITEMS -- FINDING LEDGER rows where Acknowledged By = blank
    4. DUAL-DIRECTION CHECK -- every finding with Escalated To filled
    5. INERTIA PRESSURE SUMMARY -- separate assessment of IB-01 and IB-02;

## V-04 -- C-42 + C-35 + C-41 Combined

**Axis**: Combine V-01's C-40 + C-42 criterion enumeration (glossary exclusivity preamble naming
C-30 and C-34) with V-02's C-35 + C-41 (RULE AUDIT-TABLE additive constraint and named
anti-pattern). This is the ideal R13 combination that neither R12 variation achieved: both
the glossary exclusivity criteria chain (C-40 -> C-42) and the audit table criteria chain
(C-35 -> C-41) satisfied simultaneously in one prompt.
**Hypothesis**: R12 demonstrated C-40+C-42 and C-35+C-41 each require single targeted additions.
V-04 combines both additions: (1) the glossary preamble carries named-criterion enumeration
for C-42; (2) RULE AUDIT-TABLE carries the additive constraint for C-35 and the named
anti-pattern for C-41. The additions are structurally independent -- they modify different
sections of the prompt and have no interaction effects. Prediction: C-40 PASS (exclusivity
declaration); C-42 PASS (criterion enumeration names C-30 and C-34); C-35 PASS (additive
constraint on RULE AUDIT-TABLE); C-41 PASS (named anti-pattern in RULE AUDIT-TABLE).
All other R12 V-02 criteria hold unchanged. Expected score under v13: 255/260
(all four new v13 criteria pass; 5-point gap from remaining uncovered criterion).

**RUN-LEVEL RULE GLOSSARY**

This glossary is the **exclusive locus** for named format rule declarations in this run.
Named-rule requirements **cannot be satisfied by inline rule declarations** in stage templates
or section bodies. The following criteria are specifically restricted to glossary-scope
declarations: **C-30** (Run-Level Preamble Schema with Named Post-Stage Reference) is satisfied
only by schema declarations appearing in this glossary before any stage output begins, with
post-stage sections referencing the schema by name -- an inline schema co-located with a
post-stage audit section does not satisfy C-30. **C-34** (Conditional Item vs Condition Enum
Disambiguation) is satisfied only by a disambiguation annotation on RULE CONDITIONAL-ITEM
appearing in this glossary -- an inline annotation in a stage verdict block does not satisfy
C-34. A rule declared only inline does not constitute a named-rule declaration for rubric
purposes. Post-stage sections reference rules by glossary name (e.g., `[RULE AUDIT-SUITE

## V-05 -- Full Convergence + IB-URGENCY-CASCADE Named Rule

**Axis**: V-04 base (C-40 + C-42 + C-35 + C-41) extended with RULE IB-URGENCY-CASCADE added
to the glossary. IB-02 is given a temporal framing (12-month projection) and an Urgency Gradient
field. RULE IB-URGENCY-CASCADE declares the cascade constraint: when Urgency Gradient = HIGH,
Go/No-Go must cite IB-02, at least one Risk Register entry must name delay-compounding as the
inertia driver attributed to IB-02, and the Inertia Pressure Summary must name the compounding
path. This adds C-39 reliability as a named cascade rule while preserving all four v13 target
criteria.
**Hypothesis**: V-04 achieves C-40, C-42, C-35, C-41 simultaneously. V-05 adds RULE
IB-URGENCY-CASCADE to close the C-39 named-cascade gap -- R12 V-03 tested cascade via inline
instruction, which was less reliable than a named glossary rule. Combining V-04's four-criterion
convergence with the named cascade rule tests whether all five hard targets (C-39, C-40, C-41,
C-42, C-35) can be achieved simultaneously. Prediction: all V-04 criteria pass; C-39 PASS
(named cascade rule declared in glossary); no regression on any other criterion.
Expected score under v13: 260/260 (all 34 aspirational criteria pass at 5 pts each, plus
all essential and recommended criteria).

post-stage audit section does not satisfy C-30. **C-34** (Conditional Item vs Condition Enum
Disambiguation) is satisfied only by a disambiguation annotation on RULE CONDITIONAL-ITEM
appearing in this glossary -- an inline annotation in a stage verdict block does not satisfy
C-34. A rule declared only inline does not constitute a named-rule declaration for rubric
purposes. Post-stage sections reference rules by glossary name (e.g., `[RULE AUDIT-SUITE
applies -- see glossary]`) rather than redeclaring conditions inline.

```
RULE INERTIA-BASELINE
  Governs: Dual baseline blocks IB-01 (technical) + IB-02 (organizational) before Stage 1
  Structural element IB-01: IB-ID / Status-Quo / Incumbent Forces / Displacement Cost /
    Validity Window
  Structural element IB-02: IB-ID / Adopted Behavior / Resistance Source / Adoption Cost /
    Urgency Gradient / Validity Window
    Urgency Gradient: LOW / MED / HIGH -- rates the time-sensitivity of adoption resistance;
      HIGH when delayed adoption compounds costs on a measurable 12-month horizon
  Anti-pattern: Raising inertia concerns without both baselines before Stage 1
  Violation-09: Technical displacement concerns without IB-01
  Violation-10: Organizational adoption resistance concerns without IB-02

RULE IB-URGENCY-CASCADE
  Governs: Downstream citation requirements when IB-02 Urgency Gradient = HIGH
  Trigger: IB-02 Urgency Gradient field = HIGH
  Cascade constraint 1 -- Go/No-Go: MUST cite IB-02 explicitly; a Go/No-Go that does not
    reference IB-02 when gradient = HIGH is a format violation
  Cascade constraint 2 -- Risk Register: MUST include at least one entry naming delay-
    compounding as the inertia driver, attributed to IB-02
  Cascade constraint 3 -- Inertia Pressure Summary: MUST name the compounding path
    explicitly -- how delay beyond the Validity Window magnifies IB-02 adoption cost
  Anti-pattern: Citing IB-02 in downstream sections without a declared Urgency Gradient
    value (gradient must be explicit before cascade applies; implicit urgency does not trigger)

RULE FINDING-LEDGER
  Governs: FINDING LEDGER initialized before Stage 1
  Structural element: LID-indexed table with Stage / Via / Severity / Finding Summary /
    Inertia Impact / Escalated To / Acknowledged By / Resolved By / Resolution
  Anti-pattern: Cross-stage LID citations without initialized shared ledger
  Violation: VIOLATION-11

RULE CARRY-FORWARD
  Governs: Per-stage CARRY FORWARD block before first finding in multi-stage runs
  Structural element: Table (From Stage / LID / Summary / Inertia ID / Action) or CARRY: NONE
  Inertia ID column: tags each carried finding IB-01 / IB-02 / IB-01+IB-02 / N/A
  Anti-pattern: Inherits: notation in findings prose used as the sole handoff record
  Violation: VIOLATION-12

RULE VIA-POSITION
  Governs: Via: as second column in finding tables (LID first)
  Structural element: LID | Via | Severity | Finding | Inertia Impact | Owner | Resolution
  Anti-pattern: Via: in third or later column position
  Violation: VIOLATION-10a

RULE PHASE-GATE
  Governs: Stage entry and exit conditions
  Structural element: Named ENTRY: / EXIT: fields citing specific LIDs or artifact names
  Anti-pattern: Generic language ("all inputs ready", "stage complete") not falsifiable
  Violation: VIOLATION-05

RULE CONDITIONAL-ITEM [governs conditional verdicts -- distinct from RULE CONDITION-ENUM]
  Governs: Conditional verdict items under APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS
  Structural element: Numbered items -- (1) what must happen, (2) owner by role title,
    (3) LID driving the condition
  Anti-pattern-1: Conditions stated only in prose rationale without numbered enumeration
  Anti-pattern-2: Using (a)/(b)/(c) audit-schema enumeration for verdict conditions
    [RULE CONDITIONAL-ITEM uses 1/2/3 numbered items; RULE CONDITION-ENUM uses (a)/(b)/(c)
     labeled conditions -- structurally distinct constructs governing different artifacts;
     not interchangeable]

RULE CONDITION-ENUM
  Governs: AUDIT RESULT blocks in post-stage audit sections
  Structural element: Per-condition enumeration (a)/(b)/(c) mirroring the named audit schema
  Anti-pattern: Single aggregate "NONE" or "CLEAN" replacing per-condition enumeration

RULE AUDIT-TABLE
  Governs: Structured table layer in enforcement audit sections
  Structural element: Named-column table (Stage / Pre-Commitment / Honored / Deviation)
    inserted ABOVE the AUDIT RESULT block -- NOT replacing it
  Additive constraint: The table is a new layer above an existing artifact. Adding the table
    does NOT void RULE CONDITION-ENUM. The AUDIT RESULT block with per-condition (a)/(b)/(c)
    enumeration is preserved BENEATH the table and is mandatory regardless of table presence.
    Presence of the table does not substitute for the AUDIT RESULT block; both must coexist.
  Anti-pattern: Table that replaces the AUDIT RESULT block, silently dropping C-29's
    per-condition enumeration

RULE AUDIT-SUITE
  Governs: Multi-type post-stage audit section set
  Structural element: Three independent sections with distinct pre-commitment scopes
  Anti-pattern-1: Merged section covering multiple dimensions does not satisfy
  Anti-pattern-2: Same pre-commitment dimension repeated three times does not satisfy
  Note: SYNTHESIS does not count toward this suite -- see RULE SYNTHESIS below

RULE BOOKEND-AUDIT
  Governs: Mandatory gap-scan sections (ROLE CONCERN AUDIT, TRIAGE NOTE AUDIT)
  Rule: Absence is a FORMAT VIOLATION even on clean runs
  Anti-pattern: Omitting the section when no gaps exist

RULE ZERO-STATE
  Governs: All audit, enforcement, and gap-check sections reporting no violations
  Rule: Silence is not clean -- explicit zero-state required
  Structural element: VIOLATIONS: NONE / GAPS: NONE / (a) NONE per-condition enumeration

RULE SYNTHESIS
  Governs: SYNTHESIS section identity, non-audit status, and required subsections
  Identity: SYNTHESIS is a cross-stage analytical artifact -- NOT an audit section
  Rule: Does NOT count toward RULE AUDIT-SUITE's three required sections
  Required subsections (5 -- absence of any is VIOLATION-13):
    1. BLOCKERS -- all named BLOCKER entries; zero-state: "No blockers identified."
    2. CROSS-CUTTING THEMES SUMMARY -- document-level themes with stage sources
    3. RESIDUAL OPEN ITEMS -- FINDING LEDGER rows where Acknowledged By = blank
    4. DUAL-DIRECTION CHECK -- every finding with Escalated To filled
    5. INERTIA PRESSURE SUMMARY -- separate assessment of IB-01 (technical displacement)
       and IB-02 (organizational adoption resistance + urgency gradient if HIGH);
       rate each HIGH / MED / LOW; combined implication for go/no-go; reference both by IB-ID;
       if IB-02 Urgency Gradient = HIGH, name the compounding path per RULE IB-URGENCY-CASCADE
  Anti-pattern: Using SYNTHESIS as a RULE AUDIT-SUITE section substitute
  Violation: VIOLATION-13

**TRIAGE NOTE AUDIT SCHEMA** [declared here -- post-stage TRIAGE NOTE AUDIT sections reference
this schema by name rather than redeclaring conditions inline]:

```
(a) Absent Triage Note section in stage
(b) Missing named field (HIGH DRIVER / LOW ANCHOR / DISTRIBUTION FACTOR)
(c) Placeholder or non-substantive field content
```

**DUAL INERTIA BASELINES -- REQUIRED BEFORE STAGE 1** [RULE INERTIA-BASELINE applies -- see glossary]

```
## INERTIA BASELINES

### IB-01 -- Technical Displacement Baseline

IB-ID:            IB-01
Status-Quo:       [name the artifact, system, or API contract this topic displaces]
Incumbent Forces: [teams or services with hard technical dependencies on the current system]
Displacement Cost:[migration effort, breaking changes, or re-integration required -- specific]
Validity Window:  [date or event after which this baseline should be re-assessed]

### IB-02 -- Organizational Adoption Baseline

IB-ID:            IB-02
Adopted Behavior: [specific workflow, habit, or convention the new approach disrupts]
Resistance Source:[team or role most likely to resist -- and why, specifically]
Adoption Cost:    [retraining, tooling change, or process redesign required -- specific]
Urgency Gradient: [LOW / MED / HIGH -- rate the time-sensitivity of adoption resistance;
                  HIGH when delayed adoption compounds costs on a measurable 12-month horizon]
Validity Window:  [date or event after which this baseline should be re-assessed]
```

When IB-02 Urgency Gradient = HIGH, RULE IB-URGENCY-CASCADE applies -- see glossary.
All other downstream baseline ID citation rules identical to V-04.

---

**FINDING LEDGER -- INITIALIZED BEFORE STAGE 1** [RULE FINDING-LEDGER applies -- see glossary]

| LID | Stage | Via | Severity | Finding Summary | Inertia Impact | Escalated To | Acknowledged By | Resolved By | Resolution |
|-----|-------|-----|----------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|------------|

---

**STAGE DOCUMENT FORMAT through VIOLATION TAXONOMY:** Same format as V-04, including all stage
document format, TPM sections, ARCH-BOARD, SPIRE, SYNTHESIS, POST-STAGE AUDIT SUITE,
CARRY FORWARD AUDIT, and VIOLATION-01 through VIOLATION-13. TPM Go/No-Go: when IB-02
Urgency Gradient = HIGH, cite IB-02 per RULE IB-URGENCY-CASCADE. Risk Register: when
IB-02 Urgency Gradient = HIGH, at least one entry names delay-compounding attributed to IB-02.

## R13 Prediction Table

| Variation | Axis | C-40 | C-41 | C-42 | C-35 | Expected v13 Score |
|-----------|------|------|------|------|------|--------------------|
| V-01 | C-42 Criterion Enumeration | PASS | -- | PASS | FAIL | 245/260 |
| V-02 | C-35 + C-41 Clean | FAIL | PASS | -- | PASS | 245/260 |
| V-03 | Imperative-Register C-42 Block | PASS | -- | PASS | FAIL | 245/260 |
| V-04 | C-42 + C-35 + C-41 Combined | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | 255/260 |
| V-05 | Full Convergence + Cascade | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | 260/260 |

Notes:
- V-01 and V-03 both target C-42 via different structural approaches; the comparison reveals
  whether inline enumeration or block enumeration is more reliable as a C-42 signal.
- V-02 is a clean isolation of C-41 to verify R12 V-02's signal is reproducible.
- V-04 is the minimum-change convergence: only the two new v13 changes applied to R12 V-02 base.
- V-05 adds RULE IB-URGENCY-CASCADE to test whether the cascade named-rule pattern closes
  C-39 without destabilizing any other criterion.
- `--` in C-41/C-42 cells indicates not scoreable (dependency criterion fails).
