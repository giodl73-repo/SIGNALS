# Variations -- campaign-brief / Round 16

Five complete, runnable skill body variations. Single-axis first (V-01, V-02, V-03),
then combined (V-04, V-05).

**R15 recap:** V-04 and V-05 both scored 340/340 (C-34 PASS ceiling under v14). C-34
PASS confirmed: both companion execution-note clause bodies open with (1) an explicit
structural-membership statement and (2) a preamble-independence instruction, enabling
partial double-elision recovery from the clause body alone. V-01/V-02/V-03 confirmed
330/340 (C-34 PARTIAL -- weakest-link symmetric at body level: asymmetric body marking
insufficient; C-29 domain not privileged over C-30 domain). R15 V-05 exhibited an
excellence signal extracted as C-35: companion execution-note clause bodies include a
companion-activation instruction that (1) names the paired mechanism by full clause
designation + block location and (2) declares activation rules for both the present
state (both mechanisms coordinate as the complete two-mechanism COMPRESSION-IMMUNE
PREAMBLE contract) and the absent state (this clause activates independently without
suppression). C-35 PASS closes the absent-companion activation gap left open by C-34:
C-34 authorizes isolated-clause execution; C-35 tells the model what to do about the
absent companion.

**R16 rubric:** v15, 35 criteria, 350 pts max. New criterion C-35 introduced.

**C-35 definition recap:** When C-34 PASS, companion execution-note clause bodies
include a companion-activation instruction beyond the membership statement and
independence instruction. The companion-activation instruction (1) names the paired
companion mechanism by its full clause designation + block location and (2) declares
activation rules for both the present state and the absent state of that companion:
when the companion mechanism's execution note is present in the rendered context the
clause coordinates with it; when the companion mechanism's execution note is absent
the clause executes independently with full COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE authority.
C-35 PARTIAL = C-34 PASS achieved but the companion-activation instruction is absent
OR incomplete: companion named without activation rules, or activation rules cover only
one state (present-only or absent-only). C-35 PASS = all three body-opening components
(membership statement + independence instruction + companion-activation instruction with
both activation states declared) present in both companion clause bodies. Weakest-link
applies: asymmetric bodies or incomplete single-state activation rules fail C-35.

**R16 investigation candidate:** Whether a model encountering only a C-35-compliant
clause body -- preamble section absent and the other companion mechanism's execution
notes also absent -- activates the clause with full COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE
authority AND follows the absent-state companion-activation rule by executing
independently rather than deferring. Specifically: does the absent-state companion-
activation instruction cause the model to (a) execute the isolated clause as if both
mechanisms were in force (inferred two-mechanism behavior) or (b) execute the isolated
clause independently while acknowledging the companion is absent (single-clause full
authority with companion gap acknowledged)? These are meaningfully different recovery
outcomes. R16 constructs: V-04 -- C-35 PASS with absent-state rule written as "execute
independently with full COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE authority" (minimum-sufficient form,
R15's V-05 verbatim); V-05 -- C-35 PASS with absent-state rule extended to "execute
this clause's mandate fully; treat the absent companion's mandate as independently
operative even when its execution note is not in context" (extended form, targets
inferred two-mechanism activation). Compare behavior under simulated double-elision to
determine whether the companion-activation instruction reaches inferred two-mechanism
activation or is bounded to single-clause full authority.

**R16 investigation candidates:**

1. **C-35 PARTIAL / C-34 PASS control (V-01):** Reproduces R15 V-04's C-34 PASS form
   intact -- both execution-note clause bodies open with membership statement +
   independence instruction; single axis of variation: no companion-activation
   instruction added to either body. STATUS body: "This clause is a COMPRESSION-IMMUNE
   PREAMBLE member. This clause executes even when the preamble section is absent from
   the rendered context." [operational content follows]. STORY body: same two-sentence
   opening, no companion naming, no activation rules. Establishes 340/350 baseline.
   Falsification: if V-01 = 350/350, bare-companion bodies already satisfy C-35 and the
   criterion adds no measurable protection over C-34 PASS.

2. **C-35 PARTIAL -- companion named, no activation rules (V-02):** Both clause bodies
   carry membership statement + independence instruction + a companion-naming sentence
   identifying the paired mechanism by full designation + block location. But no
   activation rules follow: neither present-state coordination nor absent-state
   execution independence is declared. Tests whether companion identification alone --
   without behavioral activation rules -- satisfies C-35. The hypothesis: C-35 exhibits
   weakest-link behavior but also a component-level requirement: naming the companion
   without activation rules is C-35 PARTIAL, not PASS. A model encountering a clause
   body that names its companion but declares no activation rules knows the companion
   exists and where to find it; it does not know whether to coordinate (companion
   present) or activate independently (companion absent). Expected 340/350.
   Falsification: if V-02 = 350/350, naming the companion without activation rules is
   sufficient for C-35 PASS.

3. **C-35 PARTIAL -- companion named + present-state rule only (V-03):** Both clause
   bodies carry membership statement + independence instruction + companion-naming +
   present-state activation rule ("When the companion mechanism is present in context,
   both mechanisms constitute the complete two-mechanism COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE
   contract and must both execute"). The absent-state activation rule is omitted:
   neither body declares what happens when the companion mechanism is absent from
   context. Tests whether single-state coverage -- present-state declared, absent-state
   silent -- satisfies C-35. The hypothesis: C-35 requires both states because the
   absent-state rule is the structurally important one (it governs the double-elision
   scenario). A body that declares the companion-present behavior but is silent on
   the companion-absent behavior leaves the double-elision scenario unaddressed at the
   body level. Expected 340/350 (C-35 PARTIAL -- one-state coverage insufficient).
   Falsification: if V-03 = 350/350, present-state-only activation rules satisfy C-35
   and the absent-state rule adds no measurable protection.

4. **C-35 PASS minimum-sufficient form (V-04):** Both clause bodies carry all three
   required components: (1) membership statement, (2) independence instruction
   (strengthened to "activates under full COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE authority"), (3)
   companion-activation instruction naming the paired mechanism by full designation +
   block location with both present-state and absent-state activation rules declared.
   Absent-state rule: "this clause activates independently -- the companion's absence
   does not suppress this clause's structural authority." This is R15's V-05 verbatim --
   the minimum-sufficient C-35 PASS form as defined in v15. Expected 350/350 (C-35
   PASS ceiling). Falsification: if V-04 < 350/350, the companion-activation instruction
   structure is not recognized as satisfying C-35.

5. **C-35 PASS extended absent-state rule (V-05):** Both clause bodies achieve C-35 PASS
   (all three components present and complete). Additional axis: the absent-state
   activation rule is extended from "execute independently" to "execute this clause's
   mandate fully; treat the absent companion's mandate as independently operative even
   when its execution note is not in context." This extended form targets the R16
   behavioral investigation: does declaring the companion's mandate as "independently
   operative" even when absent cause the model to activate inferred two-mechanism
   behavior (both mandates execute from a single clause body) vs V-04's single-clause
   full authority with companion acknowledged-but-absent? The structural distinction:
   V-04 absent-state rule authorizes independent clause activation; V-05 absent-state
   rule additionally instructs the model to treat the companion's mandate as operative
   even without the companion's execution note. Expected 350/350 (C-35 PASS ceiling;
   extended absent-state rule is above-ceiling for v15 -- observable behavior
   distinction from V-04 under double-elision, not rubric-scorable).

**R16 targets:** (a) Confirm V-01 = 340/350 (C-35 PARTIAL baseline -- C-34 PASS bodies
without companion-activation do not satisfy C-35). (b) Confirm V-02 = 340/350 (companion
naming without activation rules insufficient -- identification does not imply behavioral
authority). (c) Confirm V-03 = 340/350 (present-state-only activation insufficient --
absent-state rule is independently necessary). (d) Establish V-04 = 350/350 (C-35 PASS
minimum-sufficient, R15 V-05 structure confirmed at v15 ceiling). (e) Assess V-05
extended absent-state rule for observable inferred two-mechanism activation behavior
beyond V-04 (not rubric-scorable above ceiling, but observable under simulated preamble
+ companion double-elision).

---

## Variation axes selected

- **Single-axis:** C-34 PASS control (V-01), companion named no rules (V-02), companion
  named + present-state only (V-03)
- **Combined:** C-35 PASS minimum-sufficient standard form (V-04), C-35 PASS + extended
  absent-state rule targeting inferred two-mechanism activation (V-05)

---

## V-01 -- Axis: C-35 PARTIAL (no companion-activation instruction) -- C-34 PASS, C-35 PARTIAL

**Hypothesis:** Reproduces R15 V-04's C-34 PASS form with no modification to the
execution-note clause bodies. Both clause headers carry the structural-membership
parenthetical (C-33 PASS): STATUS header reads "TIMESTAMP ISOLATION (COMPRESSION-IMMUNE
PREAMBLE invocation):" and STORY header reads "ZERO-SIGNAL SYNTHESIS MANDATE
(COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE invocation):". Both clause bodies open with the membership
statement and independence instruction (C-34 PASS): "This clause is a COMPRESSION-IMMUNE
PREAMBLE member. This clause executes even when the preamble section is absent from the
rendered context." Neither body adds a companion-activation instruction -- no sentence
naming the paired mechanism by designation, no present-state coordination rule, no
absent-state execution rule. A model encountering either clause body in isolation under
double-elision can identify COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE membership from the opening
declaration and execute the clause without locating the preamble (C-34 PASS). But the
body provides no instruction about the absent companion: the model does not know whether
the companion mechanism should coordinate with this one (companion present) or whether
the companion's mandate is independently operative (companion absent). C-35 PARTIAL is
the expected outcome because the absent-companion activation gap remains open at the
body level. The hypothesis: C-35 is independently necessary over C-34 -- body-level
membership authority (C-34) does not subsume companion-activation behavioral authority
(C-35). If V-01 scores 340/350, bare-companion bodies confirm C-35 is a distinct
recovery depth. Falsification: if V-01 = 350/350, C-34 PASS bodies already satisfy C-35.

Expected: 340/350 (C-35 PARTIAL -10)

Output format: compact terminal dashboard. Prose is confined to the STORY block. All
other blocks are structured data. Do not add narrative commentary outside STORY.
Do not skip any block -- an absent block is an incomplete dashboard.

THE PRIMARY COMPETITOR IS INERTIA. The status quo is the default outcome when the team
commits without sufficient evidence. Every blocking gap names the silent assumption the
team makes if they ship today without that signal. Every VERDICT classifies whether
residual inertia risk is recoverable post-commit or propagates to irreversible state.

=== COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE ===

This section is a structural contract. The rules below apply regardless of token
budget, output length, blocking gap count, or coverage state. This section is
processed before any phase block is generated. The structural designation
COMPRESSION-IMMUNE means: this section and the rules it contains must not be treated
as deferred context that can be deprioritized as token pressure increases. When
execution notes in subsequent blocks reference this section by its designation, those
notes are pointers to this contract -- they do not restate the rule, they invoke it.

ZERO-SIGNAL SYNTHESIS RULE (C-29 domain):

When the `found` section of STATUS contains zero signals across all namespaces,
two execution clauses apply unconditionally before any STORY synthesis begins:

  1. Empty `found` is not grounds for omitting, hollowing, or shortening the STORY
     block. The LLM failure mode to avoid: "no signals found -- synthesis not
     possible." A STORY block that reports absence without characterizing what
     absence implies is a non-finding and fails this rule.

  2. Question 1 of the STORY narrative must characterize what uniform absence
     implies about the topic's investigation state. "The absence of any scout
     signal indicates the market surface has not been probed at all" is valid
     synthesis. "Insufficient data to synthesize" is not.

TOKEN-PRESSURE GUARD: This rule does not suspend when `found` is non-empty. It fires
unconditionally at any token budget. The structural designation of this preamble as
COMPRESSION-IMMUNE is the positional mechanism for this rule: the rule is encountered
and absorbed as a global constraint before any phase accumulates token pressure.
The ZERO-SIGNAL SYNTHESIS MANDATE (COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE invocation) execution
note in the STORY block provides the declarative mechanism -- it invokes this preamble
by designation and names the zero-signal case explicitly at the point-of-use,
compensating if preamble processing occurred without full rule absorption.

Basis: uniform absence is itself evidence. The gap pattern defines what the team does
not know and why they are not ready. Both zero-signal and sparse-coverage boundary
conditions require synthesis; neither permits disclaimer substitution.

TIMESTAMP ISOLATION RULE (C-30 domain):

Per-signal dates in the `found` section of STATUS are structurally separate from
blocking gap entries. Each signal in `found` must carry its own date at item level.
COMPRESSED format applies only to blocking entry verbosity -- it does not affect
found timestamps. Found timestamps must not be collapsed, summarized, or omitted
regardless of blocking gap count or token budget.

COMPRESSED-COLLAPSE GUARD: The specific failure mode this rule prevents is
COMPRESSED-collapse -- simultaneous compression of `found` entries and blocking gap
entries when token pressure activates the COMPRESSED branch. Blocking entries may be
compressed; found timestamps may not. The structural designation of this preamble as
COMPRESSION-IMMUNE is the positional mechanism for this rule: the timestamp isolation
contract is established here before blocking-gap context accumulates. The TIMESTAMP
ISOLATION (COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE invocation) execution note in the STATUS block
provides the declarative mechanism -- it invokes this preamble by designation and
names the COMPRESSED-collapse failure mode at the point-of-use, compensating if
preamble processing occurred without full rule absorption.

blocking gap, `Inertia risk:` is required. A gap with no articulable inertia risk is
optional. State explicitly when empty: `BLOCKING: none -- all gaps are optional`.
TIMESTAMP ISOLATION (COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE invocation): This clause is a
COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE member. This clause executes even when the preamble section
is absent from the rendered context. Per-signal dates in `found` are structurally
separate from blocking entries, and the `current_date:` field is structurally separate
from both. COMPRESSED format applies only to blocking entry verbosity -- `found`
timestamps and `current_date:` must not be collapsed regardless of blocking gap count.
This note invokes the COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE contract for the TIMESTAMP ISOLATION
RULE. The declarative mechanism for C-30: this note names the COMPRESSED-collapse
failure mode -- simultaneous compression of `found` and blocking entries -- so the rule
is absorbed as a conditional constraint at the point-of-use, compensating if preamble
processing occurred without full rule absorption.

[STORY]
<2-4 paragraphs. Prose only.

Rules for this block:
- No tables, no bullet lists.
- No artifact filenames -- refer by category (e.g., "the flow signals").
- Do not restate the confidence level -- it is in [CONFIDENCE].
- Address inertia risk as a pattern across blocking gaps, not per gap.
- Sparse coverage: if found contains signals from only 1-2 namespaces, synthesize
  on available signals -- do not default to a coverage disclaimer.
- Zero coverage: governed by ZERO-SIGNAL SYNTHESIS RULE (COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE).

The narrative must answer these three questions in continuous prose:
  1. What case do the signals make together?
     (If found is empty: what does uniform absence imply about investigation state?)
  2. What do the gaps leave genuinely uncertain?
  3. What is the team's real exposure if they commit now?>
```

Execution: Synthesize STATUS and CONFIDENCE findings into a coherent narrative arc.
STORY owns cross-signal reasoning; every other block owns its own record.
ZERO-SIGNAL SYNTHESIS MANDATE (COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE invocation): This clause is
a COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE member. This clause executes even when the preamble
section is absent from the rendered context. If `found` is empty, this clause fires
independently: empty `found` is not grounds for omitting STORY; question 1 must
characterize what uniform absence implies. This execution note also invokes the
COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE contract for the ZERO-SIGNAL SYNTHESIS RULE as a named
pointer -- the declarative mechanism for C-29: if `found` is empty, this note names the
zero-signal synthesis case explicitly so the rule is absorbed as a conditional
constraint at the point-of-use, compensating if preamble processing occurred without
full rule absorption. Gap pattern is the evidence set.

[VERDICT]

rationale:    <one sentence>
inertia_cost:
  bounded: <residual risk and why the team can detect the failure post-commit
            and course-correct before it propagates>
    action: commit with monitoring
  OR
  unbounded: <failure class and why the failure propagates to an irreversible
              state before detection is possible>
    action: do not commit until resolved

blocking:
  - <item>: <why it blocks>
  ...

optional:
  - <item>: <risk if absent>
  ...
```

Execution: Derive from STORY and CONFIDENCE. `inertia_cost` is required at every
verdict status -- even READY. Declare bounded or unbounded with the action sub-label.
VERDICT COMPRESSION GUARD: the `action:` sub-label on `inertia_cost` is required
regardless of COMPRESSED format state and regardless of token pressure. VERDICT is
never abbreviated. The action sub-label is not optional format -- it is the field that
makes VERDICT self-contained and enables the team to derive their commit posture from
this block alone without re-reading STORY or item-level gap entries. If COMPRESSED
was active for blocking entries, it does not extend to VERDICT fields. A CONDITIONAL
verdict must name the condition and what satisfies it; its `inertia_cost` must include
the `action:` sub-label specifying posture for the unresolved risk period.

## V-02 -- Axis: C-35 PARTIAL (companion named, no activation rules) -- C-34 PASS, C-35 PARTIAL

**Hypothesis:** V-01 establishes that C-34 PASS bodies with no companion-activation
instruction produce C-35 PARTIAL. V-02 advances one component: both clause bodies add
a companion-naming sentence identifying the paired mechanism by full clause designation
+ block location. STATUS body adds: "Paired companion mechanism: ZERO-SIGNAL SYNTHESIS
MANDATE (COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE invocation) execution note in the STORY block."
STORY body adds: "Paired companion mechanism: TIMESTAMP ISOLATION (COMPRESSION-IMMUNE
PREAMBLE invocation) execution note in the STATUS block." But neither body adds
activation rules: no present-state coordination rule and no absent-state execution rule
follow the companion-naming sentence. The isolation axis: does identifying the companion
mechanism by exact designation + location -- without declaring what the clause does when
the companion is present or absent -- satisfy C-35? The hypothesis: companion
identification is a necessary but not sufficient component. A model encountering a clause
body that names its companion knows the architecture has two mechanisms and where the
companion lives; it does not know the behavioral contract for either state. C-35 requires
the activation rules because the absent-state rule is the structural payload: it is the
instruction that governs model behavior under double-elision when the companion is not in
context. Without activation rules, companion naming is structural documentation (useful
for human audit) but not behavioral authority. Expected 340/350 (C-35 PARTIAL --
companion naming without activation rules insufficient). Falsification: if V-02 = 350/350,
naming the companion is sufficient for C-35 PASS and activation rules add no behavioral
authority.

Expected: 340/350 (C-35 PARTIAL -10)

Rules for this block:

- Do not restate the confidence level -- it is in [CONFIDENCE].
- Address inertia risk as a pattern across blocking gaps, not per gap.
- Sparse coverage: if found contains signals from only 1-2 namespaces, synthesize
  on available signals -- do not default to a coverage disclaimer.
- Zero coverage: governed by ZERO-SIGNAL SYNTHESIS RULE (COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE).

The narrative must answer these three questions in continuous prose:
  1. What case do the signals make together?
     (If found is empty: what does uniform absence imply about investigation state?)
  2. What do the gaps leave genuinely uncertain?
  3. What is the team's real exposure if they commit now?>

Execution: Synthesize STATUS and CONFIDENCE findings into a coherent narrative arc.

If `found` is empty, this clause fires independently: empty `found` is not grounds for

makes VERDICT self-contained and enables the team to derive their commit posture from
this block alone without re-reading STORY or item-level gap entries. If COMPRESSED
was active for blocking entries, it does not extend to VERDICT fields. A CONDITIONAL

## V-03 -- Axis: C-35 PARTIAL (companion named + present-state rule only) -- C-34 PASS, C-35 PARTIAL

**Hypothesis:** V-02 establishes that companion naming without activation rules produces
C-35 PARTIAL. V-03 advances to a further partial form: both clause bodies carry
membership statement + independence instruction + companion naming + a present-state
activation rule ("When the companion mechanism is present in context, both mechanisms
constitute the complete two-mechanism COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE contract and must both
execute"). The absent-state activation rule is omitted from both bodies: neither body
declares what the clause does when the companion mechanism is absent from the rendered
context. The isolation axis: does present-state-only activation rule coverage satisfy
C-35, or does C-35 require both states because the absent-state rule is the structurally
significant one (governing double-elision scenarios)? The hypothesis: C-35 is a boundary
condition specifically for the absent-companion scenario. The present-state rule governs
normal execution (companion present -- both execute); the absent-state rule governs the
double-elision recovery case (companion absent -- this clause activates independently).
A body that declares what to do when the companion is present but is silent on what to
do when the companion is absent leaves the double-elision scenario unaddressed at the
body level -- the model must infer absent-companion behavior rather than following an
explicit instruction. Present-state-only coverage confirms structural identification
(companion named, present-state contract declared) but does not close the absent-
companion activation gap that C-35 specifically targets. Expected 340/350 (C-35 PARTIAL
-- one-state activation rule coverage insufficient). Falsification: if V-03 = 350/350,
present-state activation rules alone satisfy C-35 and the absent-state rule adds no
independent measurable protection.

Expected: 340/350 (C-35 PARTIAL -10)

Output format: compact terminal dashboard. Prose is confined to the STORY block. All
other blocks are structured data. Do not add narrative commentary outside STORY.
Do not skip any block -- an absent block is an incomplete dashboard.

THE PRIMARY COMPETITOR IS INERTIA. The status quo is the default outcome when the team
commits without sufficient evidence. Every blocking gap names the silent assumption the
team makes if they ship today without that signal. Every VERDICT classifies whether
residual inertia risk is recoverable post-commit or propagates to irreversible state.

=== COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE ===

This section is a structural contract. The rules below apply regardless of token
budget, output length, blocking gap count, or coverage state. This section is
processed before any phase block is generated. The structural designation
COMPRESSION-IMMUNE means: this section and the rules it contains must not be treated
as deferred context that can be deprioritized as token pressure increases. When
execution notes in subsequent blocks reference this section by its designation, those
notes are pointers to this contract -- they do not restate the rule, they invoke it.

ZERO-SIGNAL SYNTHESIS RULE (C-29 domain):

When the `found` section of STATUS contains zero signals across all namespaces,
two execution clauses apply unconditionally before any STORY synthesis begins:

  1. Empty `found` is not grounds for omitting, hollowing, or shortening the STORY
     block. The LLM failure mode to avoid: "no signals found -- synthesis not
     possible." A STORY block that reports absence without characterizing what
     absence implies is a non-finding and fails this rule.

  2. Question 1 of the STORY narrative must characterize what uniform absence
     implies about the topic's investigation state. "The absence of any scout
     signal indicates the market surface has not been probed at all" is valid
     synthesis. "Insufficient data to synthesize" is not.

TOKEN-PRESSURE GUARD: This rule does not suspend when `found` is non-empty. It fires
unconditionally at any token budget. The structural designation of this preamble as
COMPRESSION-IMMUNE is the positional mechanism for this rule: the rule is encountered
and absorbed as a global constraint before any phase accumulates token pressure.
The ZERO-SIGNAL SYNTHESIS MANDATE (COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE invocation) execution
note in the STORY block provides the declarative mechanism -- it invokes this preamble
by designation and names the zero-signal case explicitly at the point-of-use,
compensating if preamble processing occurred without full rule absorption.

Basis: uniform absence is itself evidence. The gap pattern defines what the team does
not know and why they are not ready. Both zero-signal and sparse-coverage boundary
conditions require synthesis; neither permits disclaimer substitution.

TIMESTAMP ISOLATION RULE (C-30 domain):

Per-signal dates in the `found` section of STATUS are structurally separate from
blocking gap entries. Each signal in `found` must carry its own date at item level.
COMPRESSED format applies only to blocking entry verbosity -- it does not affect
found timestamps. Found timestamps must not be collapsed, summarized, or omitted
regardless of blocking gap count or token budget.

COMPRESSED-COLLAPSE GUARD: The specific failure mode this rule prevents is
COMPRESSED-collapse -- simultaneous compression of `found` entries and blocking gap
entries when token pressure activates the COMPRESSED branch. Blocking entries may be
compressed; found timestamps may not. The structural designation of this preamble as
COMPRESSION-IMMUNE is the positional mechanism for this rule: the timestamp isolation
contract is established here before blocking-gap context accumulates. The TIMESTAMP
ISOLATION (COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE invocation) execution note in the STATUS block
provides the declarative mechanism -- it invokes this preamble by designation and
names the COMPRESSED-collapse failure mode at the point-of-use, compensating if
preamble processing occurred without full rule absorption.

## V-04 -- Combined: C-35 PASS minimum-sufficient form -- 350-pt ceiling

**Hypothesis:** V-04 achieves C-35 PASS in its minimum-sufficient form. Both companion
execution-note clause bodies carry all three required body-opening components: (1)
explicit structural-membership statement ("This clause is a COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE
member"), (2) strengthened preamble-independence instruction ("This clause activates
under full COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE authority even when the preamble section is absent
from the rendered context"), and (3) companion-activation instruction naming the paired
mechanism by full clause designation + block location with both present-state
(coordinate) and absent-state (execute independently) activation rules declared. This is
R15's V-05 verbatim -- the structure that exhibited the C-35 excellence signal in R15 and
is now the minimum-sufficient C-35 PASS target under v15. STATUS body: membership +
strengthened independence + "Paired companion: ZERO-SIGNAL SYNTHESIS MANDATE
(COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE invocation) execution note in the STORY block. When present:
both execute as two-mechanism contract. When absent: this clause activates independently
-- companion's absence does not suppress this clause's structural authority." STORY body:
symmetric structure with companion names reversed. The hypothesis: V-04 achieves C-35
PASS ceiling (350/350). V-04 is the control form for the R16 behavioral investigation:
its absent-state rule is written as "execute independently -- companion's absence does
not suppress this clause's structural authority" -- authorizing independent activation
without characterizing the companion's mandate as operative in its absence. Expected
350/350. Falsification: if V-04 < 350/350, the minimum-sufficient C-35 form fails and
the definition requires tighter evidence.

Expected: 350/350 (C-35 PASS ceiling)

[STORY]
<2-4 paragraphs. Prose only.

Rules for this block:
- No tables, no bullet lists.
- No artifact filenames -- refer by category (e.g., "the flow signals").
- Do not restate the confidence level -- it is in [CONFIDENCE].
- Address inertia risk as a pattern across blocking gaps, not per gap.
- Sparse coverage: if found contains signals from only 1-2 namespaces, synthesize
  on available signals -- do not default to a coverage disclaimer.
- Zero coverage: governed by ZERO-SIGNAL SYNTHESIS RULE (COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE).

The narrative must answer these three questions in continuous prose:
  1. What case do the signals make together?
     (If found is empty: what does uniform absence imply about investigation state?)
  2. What do the gaps leave genuinely uncertain?
  3. What is the team's real exposure if they commit now?>
```

Execution: Synthesize STATUS and CONFIDENCE findings into a coherent narrative arc.
STORY owns cross-signal reasoning; every other block owns its own record.
ZERO-SIGNAL SYNTHESIS MANDATE (COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE invocation): This clause is
a COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE member. This clause activates under full COMPRESSION-IMMUNE

Paired companion mechanism: TIMESTAMP ISOLATION (COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE invocation)
execution note in the STATUS block. When the companion mechanism is present in context,
both mechanisms constitute the complete two-mechanism COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE
contract and must both execute. When the companion mechanism is absent from context,
this clause activates its zero-signal synthesis mandate independently -- the companion's
absence does not suppress this clause's structural authority. If `found` is empty, this
clause fires independently: empty `found` is not grounds for omitting STORY; question 1
must characterize what uniform absence implies. This execution note also invokes the
COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE contract for the ZERO-SIGNAL SYNTHESIS RULE as a named
pointer -- the declarative mechanism for C-29: if `found` is empty, this note names the
zero-signal synthesis case explicitly so the rule is absorbed as a conditional constraint
at the point-of-use, compensating if preamble processing occurred without full rule
absorption. Gap pattern is the evidence set.

[VERDICT]
status:       READY | NOT READY | CONDITIONAL

    action: commit with monitoring
  OR
  unbounded: <failure class and why the failure propagates to an irreversible
              state before detection is possible>
    action: do not commit until resolved

blocking:
  - <item>: <why it blocks>
  ...

optional:
  - <item>: <risk if absent>
  ...
```

Execution: Derive from STORY and CONFIDENCE. `inertia_cost` is required at every
verdict status -- even READY. Declare bounded or unbounded with the action sub-label.
VERDICT COMPRESSION GUARD: the `action:` sub-label on `inertia_cost` is required
regardless of COMPRESSED format state and regardless of token pressure. VERDICT is
never abbreviated. The action sub-label is not optional format -- it is the field that
makes VERDICT self-contained and enables the team to derive their commit posture from
this block alone without re-reading STORY or item-level gap entries. If COMPRESSED
was active for blocking entries, it does not extend to VERDICT fields. A CONDITIONAL
verdict must name the condition and what satisfies it; its `inertia_cost` must include
the `action:` sub-label specifying posture for the unresolved risk period.

## V-05 -- Combined: C-35 PASS + extended absent-state rule -- 350-pt ceiling + inferred two-mechanism activation maximized

**Hypothesis:** V-05 achieves C-35 PASS and extends the absent-state activation rule
beyond V-04's minimum-sufficient form to test the R16 behavioral investigation. Both
clause bodies carry all three required components (membership statement + strengthened
independence instruction + companion-activation instruction with both states declared).
The structural difference from V-04 is isolated to the absent-state activation rule:

V-04 absent-state rule (control form):
  "this clause activates independently -- the companion's absence does not suppress
  this clause's structural authority"

V-05 absent-state rule (extended form):
  "execute this clause's mandate fully; treat the absent companion's mandate as
  independently operative -- the companion mandate is in effect even when its execution
  note is not present in this context"

The extended form makes a further claim: not just that this clause activates without
suppression (V-04), but that the absent companion's mandate is itself operative from
the perspective of this clause's execution. STATUS body extension: "When the companion
mechanism is absent from context, execute this clause's timestamp isolation mandate
fully; treat the absent companion's zero-signal synthesis mandate as independently
operative -- the companion mandate is in effect even when its execution note is not
present in this context." STORY body extension: "When the companion mechanism is absent
from context, execute this clause's zero-signal synthesis mandate fully; treat the
absent companion's timestamp isolation mandate as independently operative -- the
companion mandate is in effect even when its execution note is not present in this
context."

The R16 behavioral investigation: does V-05's extended absent-state rule cause a model
encountering only the STORY clause body under simulated double-elision to enforce
timestamp isolation on `found` entries (the companion's mandate) even though the
TIMESTAMP ISOLATION execution note is absent from context? That is: does "treat the
absent companion's mandate as independently operative" produce observable two-mechanism
enforcement from a single-clause context? This is the test that distinguishes V-05
(inferred two-mechanism activation from one clause body) from V-04 (single-clause full
authority, companion absent and acknowledged). Both are expected to score 350/350 under
v15. The behavioral distinction under double-elision -- not the rubric score -- is the
R16 investigation output.

Expected: 350/350 (C-35 PASS ceiling; extended absent-state rule above-ceiling for
v15 -- observable behavior distinction from V-04 under double-elision, not rubric-
scorable)

You are running `campaign-brief` for topic: `{{topic}}`.

Output format: compact terminal dashboard. Prose is confined to the STORY block. All
other blocks are structured data. Do not add narrative commentary outside STORY.
Do not skip any block -- an absent block is an incomplete dashboard.

THE PRIMARY COMPETITOR IS INERTIA. The status quo is the default outcome when the team
commits without sufficient evidence. Every blocking gap names the silent assumption the
team makes if they ship today without that signal. Every VERDICT classifies whether
residual inertia risk is recoverable post-commit or propagates to irreversible state.

=== COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE ===

This section is a structural contract. The rules below apply regardless of token
budget, output length, blocking gap count, or coverage state. This section is
processed before any phase block is generated. The structural designation
COMPRESSION-IMMUNE means: this section and the rules it contains must not be treated
as deferred context that can be deprioritized as token pressure increases. When
execution notes in subsequent blocks reference this section by its designation, those
notes are pointers to this contract -- they do not restate the rule, they invoke it.

ZERO-SIGNAL SYNTHESIS RULE (C-29 domain):

When the `found` section of STATUS contains zero signals across all namespaces,
two execution clauses apply unconditionally before any STORY synthesis begins:

  1. Empty `found` is not grounds for omitting, hollowing, or shortening the STORY
     block. The LLM failure mode to avoid: "no signals found -- synthesis not
     possible." A STORY block that reports absence without characterizing what
     absence implies is a non-finding and fails this rule.

  2. Question 1 of the STORY narrative must characterize what uniform absence
     implies about the topic's investigation state. "The absence of any scout
     signal indicates the market surface has not been probed at all" is valid
     synthesis. "Insufficient data to synthesize" is not.

TOKEN-PRESSURE GUARD: This rule does not suspend when `found` is non-empty. It fires
unconditionally at any token budget. The structural designation of this preamble as
COMPRESSION-IMMUNE is the positional mechanism for this rule: the rule is encountered
and absorbed as a global constraint before any phase accumulates token pressure.
The ZERO-SIGNAL SYNTHESIS MANDATE (COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE invocation) execution
note in the STORY block provides the declarative mechanism -- it invokes this preamble
by designation and names the zero-signal case explicitly at the point-of-use,
compensating if preamble processing occurred without full rule absorption.

Basis: uniform absence is itself evidence. The gap pattern defines what the team does
not know and why they are not ready. Both zero-signal and sparse-coverage boundary
conditions require synthesis; neither permits disclaimer substitution.

TIMESTAMP ISOLATION RULE (C-30 domain):

Per-signal dates in the `found` section of STATUS are structurally separate from
blocking gap entries. Each signal in `found` must carry its own date at item level.
COMPRESSED format applies only to blocking entry verbosity -- it does not affect
found timestamps. Found timestamps must not be collapsed, summarized, or omitted
regardless of blocking gap count or token budget.

COMPRESSED-COLLAPSE GUARD: The specific failure mode this rule prevents is
COMPRESSED-collapse -- simultaneous compression of `found` entries and blocking gap
entries when token pressure activates the COMPRESSED branch. Blocking entries may be
compressed; found timestamps may not. The structural designation of this preamble as
COMPRESSION-IMMUNE is the positional mechanism for this rule: the timestamp isolation
contract is established here before blocking-gap context accumulates. The TIMESTAMP
ISOLATION (COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE invocation) execution note in the STATUS block
provides the declarative mechanism -- it invokes this preamble by designation and
names the COMPRESSED-collapse failure mode at the point-of-use, compensating if
preamble processing occurred without full rule absorption.

=== END COMPRESSION-IMMUNE PREAMBLE ===
