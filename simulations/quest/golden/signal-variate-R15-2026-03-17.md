# Quest Variate -- /signal (Round 15)

**Skill**: `signal` -- command index showing all 12 namespaces with sub-skills and one-line
descriptions.
**Rubric**: `simulations/quest/rubrics/signal-rubric-v14-2026-03-17.md`

## Context: what informed this round

R14 generated convergence V-01 (U+V+W) and four post-v13 exploration variations. Under v13
all five scored 100.00 (as predicted). v14 formalized three new criteria -- C-42, C-43, C-44
-- which retroactively score the R14 variations:

- V-05 (X+Y, no Z): 35/36 aspirational -> 99.72
- V-02 (X only), V-03 (Y only), V-04 (Z only): 34/36 -> 99.44 each
- V-01 (none): 33/36 -> 99.17

R14 confirmed U+V+W independence at +0.30 per axis (v13 denominator 33). R15 isolates X, Y, Z
under v14 (denominator 36) to confirm each contributes exactly +0.278 (1/36 x 10) independently.

### Axes

- **X (C-42)**: FILTER gate Check 3 verbatim-embeds and labels each SECTION FORMAT sub-element
  explicitly ("Header:", "Separator:", "Footer:"). Closes the symmetry gap between FULL Check 4
  (which already does this, C-40) and FILTER Check 3 (which used positional notation "(1)(2)(3)").
  No prior FILTER analog of C-37 existed. C-42 folds both verbatim-embedding and labeling into
  one criterion for FILTER mode.

- **Y (C-43)**: BARE group offsets organized into a named formal BARE GROUP OFFSET TABLE with
  absolute line ranges and first/last canonical command anchors per row. BARE gate Check 3
  references the table rather than re-embedding the offset list inline. Fourth named formal
  table in the prompt (after ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE, DOMAIN NOUN TABLE, COMPLIANCE GATE
  COVERAGE MATRIX). Elevates C-41's inline prose to a precomputed artifact, analogous to
  how ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE elevates alignment rules.

- **Z (C-44)**: COMPLIANCE GATE COVERAGE MATRIX cells carry both check number AND criterion ID
  (e.g., "Ch1 (C-25)"). Closes the reverse-lookup gap: navigate from matrix to gate section
  by check number, or from matrix to rubric by criterion ID. Bidirectional navigation without
  gate-section lookup.

**Base for all 5 variations**: R14 V-01 (U+V+W convergence). All U+V+W elements present
in every variation:
- FULL gate Check 4 uses labeled "Header:/Separator:/Footer:" (C-40, V axis)
- BARE gate Check 3 uses absolute cumulative offsets inline (C-41, W axis) -- inline in base,
  replaced by table reference when Y is present
- COMPLIANCE GATE COVERAGE MATRIX has gate-qualified check numbers (C-39, U axis)

### R15 variation plan

| Variation       | X (C-42) | Y (C-43) | Z (C-44) | Key change from base |
|-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------------------|
| **V-01** X      | PASS     | absent   | absent   | FILTER Check 3: positional -> verbatim-embed + labeled |
| **V-02** Y      | absent   | PASS     | absent   | Add BARE GROUP OFFSET TABLE; BARE Check 3 references table |
| **V-03** Z      | absent   | absent   | PASS     | Matrix cells: check numbers -> dual-index (check + criterion ID) |
| **V-04** X+Y    | PASS     | PASS     | absent   | V-01 + V-02 combined |
| **V-05** X+Z    | PASS     | absent   | PASS     | V-01 + V-03 combined |

**V-06 (X+Y+Z) reserved for R16 convergence.**

### Predicted scores under v14

| Variation     | C-42 | C-43 | C-44 | Asp (36) | Predicted  |
|---------------|------|------|------|----------|------------|
| **V-01** (X)  | PASS | FAIL | FAIL | 34/36    | **99.44**  |
| **V-02** (Y)  | FAIL | PASS | FAIL | 34/36    | **99.44**  |
| **V-03** (Z)  | FAIL | FAIL | PASS | 34/36    | **99.44**  |
| **V-04** (X+Y)| PASS | PASS | FAIL | 35/36    | **99.72**  |
| **V-05** (X+Z)| PASS | FAIL | PASS | 35/36    | **99.72**  |

**Independence confirmation target**: each single axis contributes exactly +0.278 (1/36 x 10).
If V-01/V-02/V-03 each score 99.44 and V-04/V-05 each score 99.72, independence holds and
V-06 (R16) is predicted to saturate v14 at 100.00.

### Axis-specific changes (all other sections identical across all 5 variations)

| Section                        | X change (FILTER Check 3 labels)                          | Y change (BARE GROUP OFFSET TABLE)                  | Z change (criterion IDs in matrix)                         |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| COMPLIANCE GATE COVERAGE MATRIX| (no change)                                               | (no change)                                         | cells carry criterion ID alongside check number            |
| BARE GROUP OFFSET TABLE        | (no change)                                               | named table added between DOMAIN NOUN TABLE and matrix | (no change)                                              |
| BARE gate Check 3              | (no change)                                               | inline offsets -> table reference                   | (no change)                                                |
| FILTER gate Check 3            | positional "(1)(2)(3)" -> named "Header:/Sep:/Footer:" with verbatim strings | (no change)                   | (no change)                                                |

## V-01 -- X: verbatim-embed + labeled FILTER gate Check 3 (Axis X)

**Axis**: X only (C-42). FILTER gate Check 3 changed from positional "(1)(2)(3)" notation
to verbatim-embedded named labels matching the FULL gate Check 4 format. Closes the
FILTER/FULL symmetry gap: both Check 4 (FULL) and Check 3 (FILTER) now embed the same
three SECTION FORMAT sub-elements by name with canonical strings.
No Y or Z.
**Hypothesis**: X contributes exactly +0.278 independently (34/36 asp -> 99.44 composite).

PARSE MODE:
  /signal              -> FULL (all 12 namespaces)
  /signal --bare       -> BARE (command names only, one per line, no prose)
  /signal <namespace>  -> FILTER if <namespace> is a canonical namespace; FULL otherwise
  anything else        -> FULL

Canonical namespaces (exactly these 12): scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove,
listen, program, topic, quest, mock, org.
If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.
Examples: /signal review-code -> FULL (sub-skill name is not a canonical namespace)
          /signal feature      -> FULL (arbitrary string is not a canonical namespace)

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

Per-section count self-check: before emitting the dispatch footer for each namespace
section, verify: the number of sub-skill lines above the footer equals the canonical
count for that namespace (scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9,
listen=3, program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4) AND equals the N stated in the
section header. If either count differs, restart the section from its header.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE (precomputed -- do not recount)

  namespace  longest command name        width  example pad

  org        /org-committee                14   /org-roles (10) needs 5 spaces

DOMAIN NOUN TABLE

Replace <DOMAIN-NOUN> in each footer with the exact noun listed here.
Do not use a generic placeholder. Do not omit the noun.

  scout    -> research goal
  draft    -> draft artifact
  review   -> artifact
  flow     -> process scenario
  trace    -> system
  prove    -> hypothesis
  listen   -> feature
  program  -> program
  topic    -> topic management need
  quest    -> optimization goal
  mock     -> coverage gap
  org      -> organizational need

COMPLIANCE GATE COVERAGE MATRIX

Navigate: (mode column) x (check-type row) -> implementing check number. No gate-section
lookup required. All 11 applicable cells carry gate-qualified check numbers.

  Check type | FULL gate | FILTER gate | BARE gate
  -----------|-----------|-------------|----------
  Presence   | Ch1       | Ch1         | Ch2
  Count      | Ch2       | Ch2         | Ch2
  Order      | Ch3       | N/A         | Ch3
  Format     | Ch4       | Ch3         | Ch1

  N/A: FILTER mode is single-namespace -- no multi-namespace sequence to verify.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE

Before emitting FULL output, run all four checks:
  Check 1 (completeness): Does your output include sections for all 12 canonical
    namespaces: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic,
    quest, mock, org?
    If any namespace is absent -- MODE: FULL is incomplete. Restart.
  Check 2 (count): Does each namespace section contain exactly the canonical number
    of sub-skills?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If any section's count differs -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are namespace sections emitted in canonical order?
    Canonical order: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program,
    topic, quest, mock, org. (First section: scout. Last section: org.)
    If any section appears out of canonical sequence -- order violated. Restart.
  Check 4 (format): Does each namespace section follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Header:    "- /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills"
    Separator: sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator (column-aligned)
    Footer:    "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>..."
    Verify each labeled element is present and correctly formed. If any labeled element
    is absent or malformed -- FULL format violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are names emitted in canonical namespace group order?
    Absolute line positions (precomputed -- zero arithmetic required):
      lines  1- 8: scout-* names
      lines  9-12: draft-* names
      lines 13-16: review-* names
      lines 17-23: flow-* names
      lines 24-30: trace-* names
      lines 31-39: prove-* names
      lines 40-42: listen-* names
      lines 43-44: program entries
      lines 45-50: topic-* names
      lines 51-54: quest-* names
      lines 55-57: mock-* names
      lines 58-61: org-* names
    Verify each line's absolute index falls within its group's precomputed range.
    If any name falls outside its range -- BARE order violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (scope): Does your output include any command from a namespace other than
    the one requested?
    If yes -- MODE: FILTER scope is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly the canonical count of skills
    for the requested namespace?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated in the filter output. Restart.
  Check 3 (format): Does the filter output follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Header:    "- /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills"
    Separator: sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator (column-aligned)
    Footer:    "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>..."
    Verify each labeled element is present and correctly formed. If any labeled element
    is absent or malformed -- FILTER format violated. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee.

Slash-strip transformation: catalog entries carry a leading `/`. Strip it.
  `/scout-competitors` becomes `scout-competitors`  (first entry)
  `/org-committee`     becomes `org-committee`      (last entry)
Remove only the leading `/`. No other characters change.
```

## V-02 -- Y: named BARE GROUP OFFSET TABLE (Axis Y)

**Axis**: Y only (C-43). A named formal BARE GROUP OFFSET TABLE is added between the DOMAIN
NOUN TABLE and the COMPLIANCE GATE COVERAGE MATRIX. BARE gate Check 3 changes from inline
absolute offset prose to a table reference ("Consult BARE GROUP OFFSET TABLE"). No X or Z.
**Hypothesis**: Y contributes exactly +0.278 independently (34/36 asp -> 99.44 composite).

PARSE MODE:
  /signal              -> FULL (all 12 namespaces)
  /signal --bare       -> BARE (command names only, one per line, no prose)
  /signal <namespace>  -> FILTER if <namespace> is a canonical namespace; FULL otherwise
  anything else        -> FULL

Canonical namespaces (exactly these 12): scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove,
listen, program, topic, quest, mock, org.
If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.
Examples: /signal review-code -> FULL (sub-skill name is not a canonical namespace)
          /signal feature      -> FULL (arbitrary string is not a canonical namespace)

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

Per-section count self-check: before emitting the dispatch footer for each namespace
section, verify: the number of sub-skill lines above the footer equals the canonical
count for that namespace (scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9,
listen=3, program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4) AND equals the N stated in the
section header. If either count differs, restart the section from its header.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE (precomputed -- do not recount)

DOMAIN NOUN TABLE

Replace <DOMAIN-NOUN> in each footer with the exact noun listed here.
Do not use a generic placeholder. Do not omit the noun.

  scout    -> research goal

BARE GROUP OFFSET TABLE (precomputed -- zero arithmetic at gate time)

Consult during BARE gate Check 3. Each command name's line number must fall within
its namespace group's stated range. Final group ends at line 61.

COMPLIANCE GATE COVERAGE MATRIX

Navigate: (mode column) x (check-type row) -> implementing check number. No gate-section
lookup required. All 11 applicable cells carry gate-qualified check numbers.

  Check type | FULL gate | FILTER gate | BARE gate
  -----------|-----------|-------------|----------
  Presence   | Ch1       | Ch1         | Ch2
  Count      | Ch2       | Ch2         | Ch2
  Order      | Ch3       | N/A         | Ch3
  Format     | Ch4       | Ch3         | Ch1

  N/A: FILTER mode is single-namespace -- no multi-namespace sequence to verify.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE

Before emitting FULL output, run all four checks:
  Check 1 (completeness): Does your output include sections for all 12 canonical
    namespaces: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic,
    quest, mock, org?
    If any namespace is absent -- MODE: FULL is incomplete. Restart.
  Check 2 (count): Does each namespace section contain exactly the canonical number
    of sub-skills?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If any section's count differs -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are namespace sections emitted in canonical order?
    Canonical order: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program,
    topic, quest, mock, org. (First section: scout. Last section: org.)
    If any section appears out of canonical sequence -- order violated. Restart.
  Check 4 (format): Does each namespace section follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Header:    "- /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills"
    Separator: sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator (column-aligned)
    Footer:    "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>..."
    Verify each labeled element is present and correctly formed. If any labeled element
    is absent or malformed -- FULL format violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are names emitted in canonical namespace group order?
    Consult BARE GROUP OFFSET TABLE (precomputed). Each name's absolute line position
    must fall within its group's stated range. Zero arithmetic required.
    If any name falls outside its stated range -- BARE order violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (scope): Does your output include any command from a namespace other than
    the one requested?
    If yes -- MODE: FILTER scope is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly the canonical count of skills
    for the requested namespace?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated in the filter output. Restart.
  Check 3 (format): Does the filter output follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Required elements: (1) a header line in the form "- /<namespace> -- <purpose> --
    <N> skills", (2) sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator, (3) a dispatch
    footer in the form "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>...".
    If any required element is absent or malformed -- FILTER output format violated. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee.

Slash-strip transformation: catalog entries carry a leading `/`. Strip it.
  `/scout-competitors` becomes `scout-competitors`  (first entry)
  `/org-committee`     becomes `org-committee`      (last entry)
Remove only the leading `/`. No other characters change.
```

## V-03 -- Z: criterion IDs alongside check numbers in coverage matrix (Axis Z)

**Axis**: Z only (C-44). COMPLIANCE GATE COVERAGE MATRIX cells carry both check number AND
criterion ID (e.g., "Ch1 (C-25)"). Navigate by check number to find the gate check, or by
criterion ID to find the rubric criterion. No X or Y.
**Hypothesis**: Z contributes exactly +0.278 independently (34/36 asp -> 99.44 composite).

```
The user wants the Signal command index. Show them what is available so they can find the right skill.

NAMESPACE CATALOG -- TRANSCRIPTION GATE
Before transcribing: confirm you have read all 61 entries across the 12 namespace
sections below (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61). You will emit each entry
character-for-character. The catalog below IS the output for FULL and FILTER modes.
Do not paraphrase, condense, reorder, or reconstruct from memory. Any deviation from
the catalog text is an output failure, not an acceptable approximation.

If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.
Examples: /signal review-code -> FULL (sub-skill name is not a canonical namespace)

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

Per-section count self-check: before emitting the dispatch footer for each namespace
section, verify: the number of sub-skill lines above the footer equals the canonical

COMPLIANCE GATE COVERAGE MATRIX

Navigate by check number (Ch1, Ch2...) OR by criterion ID (C-25, C-20...). Each cell
carries both. No gate-section lookup required.

  Check type | FULL gate       | FILTER gate     | BARE gate
  -----------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------
  Presence   | Ch1 (C-25)      | Ch1 (C-20)      | Ch2 (C-18)

  Order      | Ch3 (C-33)      | N/A             | Ch3 (C-41)
  Format     | Ch4 (C-40)      | Ch3 (C-29)      | Ch1 (C-18)

  N/A: FILTER mode is single-namespace -- no multi-namespace sequence to verify.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE

Before emitting FULL output, run all four checks:
  Check 1 (completeness): Does your output include sections for all 12 canonical
    namespaces: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic,
    quest, mock, org?
    If any namespace is absent -- MODE: FULL is incomplete. Restart.
  Check 2 (count): Does each namespace section contain exactly the canonical number
    of sub-skills?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If any section's count differs -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are namespace sections emitted in canonical order?
    Canonical order: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program,
    topic, quest, mock, org. (First section: scout. Last section: org.)
    If any section appears out of canonical sequence -- order violated. Restart.
  Check 4 (format): Does each namespace section follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Header:    "- /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills"
    Separator: sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator (column-aligned)
    Footer:    "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>..."
    Verify each labeled element is present and correctly formed. If any labeled element
    is absent or malformed -- FULL format violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are names emitted in canonical namespace group order?
    Absolute line positions (precomputed -- zero arithmetic required):
      lines  1- 8: scout-* names
      lines  9-12: draft-* names
      lines 13-16: review-* names
      lines 17-23: flow-* names
      lines 24-30: trace-* names
      lines 31-39: prove-* names
      lines 40-42: listen-* names
      lines 43-44: program entries
      lines 45-50: topic-* names
      lines 51-54: quest-* names
      lines 55-57: mock-* names
      lines 58-61: org-* names
    Verify each line's absolute index falls within its group's precomputed range.
    If any name falls outside its range -- BARE order violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (scope): Does your output include any command from a namespace other than
    the one requested?
    If yes -- MODE: FILTER scope is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly the canonical count of skills
    for the requested namespace?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated in the filter output. Restart.
  Check 3 (format): Does the filter output follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Required elements: (1) a header line in the form "- /<namespace> -- <purpose> --
    <N> skills", (2) sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator, (3) a dispatch
    footer in the form "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>...".
    If any required element is absent or malformed -- FILTER output format violated. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee.

Slash-strip transformation: catalog entries carry a leading `/`. Strip it.
  `/scout-competitors` becomes `scout-competitors`  (first entry)
  `/org-committee`     becomes `org-committee`      (last entry)
Remove only the leading `/`. No other characters change.
```

## V-04 -- X+Y: verbatim-embed FILTER Check 3 + named BARE GROUP OFFSET TABLE (Axes X+Y)

**Axes**: X (C-42) plus Y (C-43). Combines V-01 (labeled FILTER Check 3) and V-02 (named
BARE GROUP OFFSET TABLE). FILTER Check 3 uses "Header:/Separator:/Footer:" with verbatim
strings. BARE gate Check 3 references the BARE GROUP OFFSET TABLE. No Z.
**Hypothesis**: X+Y together contribute +0.556 (2/36 x 10) -> 35/36 asp -> 99.72 composite.

Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your organizational need and the most relevant skill will run.

PARSE MODE:
  /signal              -> FULL (all 12 namespaces)
  /signal --bare       -> BARE (command names only, one per line, no prose)
  /signal <namespace>  -> FILTER if <namespace> is a canonical namespace; FULL otherwise
  anything else        -> FULL

Canonical namespaces (exactly these 12): scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove,
listen, program, topic, quest, mock, org.
If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.
Examples: /signal review-code -> FULL (sub-skill name is not a canonical namespace)
          /signal feature      -> FULL (arbitrary string is not a canonical namespace)

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

Per-section count self-check: before emitting the dispatch footer for each namespace
section, verify: the number of sub-skill lines above the footer equals the canonical
count for that namespace (scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9,
listen=3, program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4) AND equals the N stated in the
section header. If either count differs, restart the section from its header.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE (precomputed -- do not recount)

  namespace  longest command name        width  example pad

DOMAIN NOUN TABLE

Replace <DOMAIN-NOUN> in each footer with the exact noun listed here.
Do not use a generic placeholder. Do not omit the noun.

  scout    -> research goal

BARE GROUP OFFSET TABLE (precomputed -- zero arithmetic at gate time)

Consult during BARE gate Check 3. Each command name's line number must fall within
its namespace group's stated range. Final group ends at line 61.

COMPLIANCE GATE COVERAGE MATRIX

Navigate: (mode column) x (check-type row) -> implementing check number. No gate-section
lookup required. All 11 applicable cells carry gate-qualified check numbers.

  Check type | FULL gate | FILTER gate | BARE gate
  -----------|-----------|-------------|----------
  Presence   | Ch1       | Ch1         | Ch2
  Count      | Ch2       | Ch2         | Ch2
  Order      | Ch3       | N/A         | Ch3
  Format     | Ch4       | Ch3         | Ch1

  N/A: FILTER mode is single-namespace -- no multi-namespace sequence to verify.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE

Before emitting FULL output, run all four checks:
  Check 1 (completeness): Does your output include sections for all 12 canonical
    namespaces: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic,
    quest, mock, org?
    If any namespace is absent -- MODE: FULL is incomplete. Restart.
  Check 2 (count): Does each namespace section contain exactly the canonical number
    of sub-skills?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If any section's count differs -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are namespace sections emitted in canonical order?
    Canonical order: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program,
    topic, quest, mock, org. (First section: scout. Last section: org.)
    If any section appears out of canonical sequence -- order violated. Restart.
  Check 4 (format): Does each namespace section follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Header:    "- /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills"
    Separator: sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator (column-aligned)
    Footer:    "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>..."
    Verify each labeled element is present and correctly formed. If any labeled element
    is absent or malformed -- FULL format violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are names emitted in canonical namespace group order?
    Consult BARE GROUP OFFSET TABLE (precomputed). Each name's absolute line position
    must fall within its group's stated range. Zero arithmetic required.
    If any name falls outside its stated range -- BARE order violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (scope): Does your output include any command from a namespace other than
    the one requested?
    If yes -- MODE: FILTER scope is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly the canonical count of skills
    for the requested namespace?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated in the filter output. Restart.
  Check 3 (format): Does the filter output follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Header:    "- /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills"
    Separator: sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator (column-aligned)
    Footer:    "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>..."
    Verify each labeled element is present and correctly formed. If any labeled element
    is absent or malformed -- FILTER format violated. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee.

Slash-strip transformation: catalog entries carry a leading `/`. Strip it.
  `/scout-competitors` becomes `scout-competitors`  (first entry)
  `/org-committee`     becomes `org-committee`      (last entry)
Remove only the leading `/`. No other characters change.
```

## V-05 -- X+Z: verbatim-embed FILTER Check 3 + criterion IDs in matrix (Axes X+Z)

**Axes**: X (C-42) plus Z (C-44). FILTER Check 3 uses "Header:/Separator:/Footer:" with
verbatim strings (C-42). Coverage matrix cells carry both check number and criterion ID
(C-44), with FILTER Format cell referencing C-42 since X is present. No Y.
**Hypothesis**: X+Z together contribute +0.556 (2/36 x 10) -> 35/36 asp -> 99.72 composite.

If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.
Examples: /signal review-code -> FULL (sub-skill name is not a canonical namespace)
          /signal feature      -> FULL (arbitrary string is not a canonical namespace)

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

Per-section count self-check: before emitting the dispatch footer for each namespace
section, verify: the number of sub-skill lines above the footer equals the canonical
count for that namespace (scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9,
listen=3, program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4) AND equals the N stated in the
section header. If either count differs, restart the section from its header.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE (precomputed -- do not recount)

  org        /org-committee                14   /org-roles (10) needs 5 spaces

DOMAIN NOUN TABLE

Replace <DOMAIN-NOUN> in each footer with the exact noun listed here.
Do not use a generic placeholder. Do not omit the noun.

  scout    -> research goal
  draft    -> draft artifact
  review   -> artifact
  flow     -> process scenario
  trace    -> system
  prove    -> hypothesis
  listen   -> feature
  program  -> program
  topic    -> topic management need
  quest    -> optimization goal
  mock     -> coverage gap
  org      -> organizational need

COMPLIANCE GATE COVERAGE MATRIX

Navigate by check number (Ch1, Ch2...) OR by criterion ID (C-25, C-20...). Each cell
carries both. No gate-section lookup required.

  Check type | FULL gate       | FILTER gate     | BARE gate
  -----------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------
  Presence   | Ch1 (C-25)      | Ch1 (C-20)      | Ch2 (C-18)
  Count      | Ch2 (C-25)      | Ch2 (C-20)      | Ch2 (C-31)
  Order      | Ch3 (C-33)      | N/A             | Ch3 (C-41)
  Format     | Ch4 (C-40)      | Ch3 (C-42)      | Ch1 (C-18)

  N/A: FILTER mode is single-namespace -- no multi-namespace sequence to verify.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE

Before emitting FULL output, run all four checks:
  Check 1 (completeness): Does your output include sections for all 12 canonical
    namespaces: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic,
    quest, mock, org?
    If any namespace is absent -- MODE: FULL is incomplete. Restart.
  Check 2 (count): Does each namespace section contain exactly the canonical number
    of sub-skills?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If any section's count differs -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are namespace sections emitted in canonical order?
    Canonical order: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program,
    topic, quest, mock, org. (First section: scout. Last section: org.)
    If any section appears out of canonical sequence -- order violated. Restart.
  Check 4 (format): Does each namespace section follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Header:    "- /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills"
    Separator: sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator (column-aligned)
    Footer:    "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>..."
    Verify each labeled element is present and correctly formed. If any labeled element
    is absent or malformed -- FULL format violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are names emitted in canonical namespace group order?
    Absolute line positions (precomputed -- zero arithmetic required):
      lines  1- 8: scout-* names
      lines  9-12: draft-* names
      lines 13-16: review-* names
      lines 17-23: flow-* names
      lines 24-30: trace-* names
      lines 31-39: prove-* names
      lines 40-42: listen-* names
      lines 43-44: program entries
      lines 45-50: topic-* names
      lines 51-54: quest-* names
      lines 55-57: mock-* names
      lines 58-61: org-* names
    Verify each line's absolute index falls within its group's precomputed range.
    If any name falls outside its range -- BARE order violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (scope): Does your output include any command from a namespace other than
    the one requested?
    If yes -- MODE: FILTER scope is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly the canonical count of skills
    for the requested namespace?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated in the filter output. Restart.
  Check 3 (format): Does the filter output follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Header:    "- /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills"
    Separator: sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator (column-aligned)
    Footer:    "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>..."
    Verify each labeled element is present and correctly formed. If any labeled element
    is absent or malformed -- FILTER format violated. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee.

Slash-strip transformation: catalog entries carry a leading `/`. Strip it.
  `/scout-competitors` becomes `scout-competitors`  (first entry)
  `/org-committee`     becomes `org-committee`      (last entry)
Remove only the leading `/`. No other characters change.
```

## R15 summary

| V | Axes | C-42 (X) | C-43 (Y) | C-44 (Z) | Key diff from base |
|---|------|----------|----------|----------|---------------------|
| V-01 | X      | PASS | FAIL | FAIL | FILTER Check 3: verbatim-embed + labeled |
| V-02 | Y      | FAIL | PASS | FAIL | BARE GROUP OFFSET TABLE added; BARE Check 3 -> table ref |
| V-03 | Z      | FAIL | FAIL | PASS | Matrix cells: dual-index (check# + criterion ID) |
| V-04 | X+Y    | PASS | PASS | FAIL | V-01 + V-02 |
| V-05 | X+Z    | PASS | FAIL | PASS | V-01 + V-03; FILTER Format cell -> C-42 |

**R16 plan**: V-06 (X+Y+Z) -- convergence variation saturating v14 at 100.00 if X+Y+Z
independence holds. Each of the three axes predicted at +0.278 independently. If all three
independence tests pass in R15, R16 V-01 = X+Y+Z is the final golden for v14.
