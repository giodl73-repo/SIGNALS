# topic-plan Skill Variations -- Round 16 (2026-03-15)

Rubric: v16 (C-01--C-51, 43 aspirational, formula: essential*60 + recommended*30 + aspirational*10)
New criteria this round: C-50 (condition-line semantic category grouping),
C-51 (pass/halt specification co-location in dedicated labeled field)

---

## Round 16 Design Notes

R15 V-04 is the implicit ceiling that revealed C-50 and C-51. The two new v16
criteria emerge from contrasting R15 V-04 against the other R15 variations at Gate-0:

1. **C-50 from R15 V-01/V-03/V-05 condition-line gap** -- R15 V-01, V-03, and V-05 all
   satisfy C-47 (every item named individually in the condition line) using a flat
   AND-conjunction: `[A1] AND [A2] AND ... AND [D]` or items listed without category
   labels. R15 V-02 and V-04 use the grouped form: `schemas [A1][A2][A3][A4][A5][A6]
   [A7][A8] all present + phase index [B] + constraint index [C] + null annotations [D]`.
   The grouped form adds a second auditing dimension: a reader can verify completeness
   at the category level (are all expected categories present?) and at the item level
   (are all items within each category present?). V-01/V-03/V-05 satisfy C-47 at the
   item level only. C-50 requires both levels.

2. **C-51 from R15 V-01/V-02/V-05 annotation structure gap** -- R15 V-01, V-02, and V-05
   state the pass threshold and halt trigger in the same annotation sentence but not in a
   dedicated labeled field: "Gate-0 passes when all 11 items confirmed; one STOP result
   halts Phase 1." R15 V-03 and V-04 use a dedicated labeled field: "GATE-0 PASS
   THRESHOLD: passes when all 11 items confirmed; blocked by any single STOP result."
   The labeled-field form makes the complete two-sided specification independently
   locatable by field-name scan, and places pass threshold and halt trigger as a
   structural unit. V-01/V-02/V-05 each satisfy C-46 and C-48 independently but not
   C-51's co-location requirement.

**R15 gap analysis for R16:**

| Gap | R15 variations missing | R16 axis |
|-----|------------------------|----------|
| G-01 | V-01/V-03/V-05 lack C-50; V-05 lacks C-51 | V-01: Lifecycle -- semantic grouping on attestation base (C-50 isolated) |
| G-02 | V-01/V-03/V-05 lack C-51; V-05 lacks C-50 | V-02: Output format -- labeled THRESHOLD on attestation+flat base (C-51 isolated) |
| G-03 | No variation tests C-50+C-51 without C-49 | V-03: Phrasing register -- grouped+labeled THRESHOLD, no attestation (C-50+C-51, C-49 absent) |
| G-04 | No variation names C-49+C-50+C-51 as combined target | V-04: Combined LC+OF -- grouped+labeled THRESHOLD+attestation (C-49+C-50+C-51 together) |
| G-05 | C-43 through C-51 require simultaneous satisfaction | V-05: Full ceiling -- all axes (C-43--C-51) |

**Round 16 variation map:**

| Variation | Axis | Criteria targeted | C-50 | C-51 |
|-----------|------|-------------------|------|------|
| V-01 | Lifecycle emphasis -- grouped format on C-49 base | C-50 | YES | NO |
| V-02 | Output format -- labeled THRESHOLD field on C-49 base | C-51 | NO | YES |
| V-03 | Phrasing register -- grouped+labeled THRESHOLD, no attestation | C-50+C-51 (C-49 absent) | YES | YES |
| V-04 | Combined lifecycle + output format | C-49+C-50+C-51 | YES | YES |
| V-05 | Combined all axes (full R16 ceiling) | C-43--C-51 | YES | YES |

---

## V-01: Lifecycle Emphasis -- Semantic Grouping on Attestation Base

**Variation axis**: Lifecycle emphasis -- single axis. The Gate-0 condition line is
upgraded from R15 V-05 (flat AND-conjunction + attestation) to the grouped-label form:
`schemas [A1][A2][A3][A4][A5][A6][A7][A8] all present + phase index [B] + constraint
index [C] + null annotations [D]`. The attestation clause from R15 V-02 is preserved.
The pass/halt annotation remains inline (not a labeled field): "Gate-0 passes when all
11 items confirmed; one STOP result halts Phase 1." C-49 and C-48 carry forward from
R15 V-05. C-51 is deliberately absent -- the labeled-field form is not used.

**Hypothesis**: C-50 requires the condition line to organize named items into labeled
semantic categories, enabling category-level completeness verification. R15 V-05 names
all 11 items individually (C-47) and includes the attestation (C-49) but uses flat
AND-conjunction with no category structure. V-01 tests whether replacing flat AND with
semantic grouping (`schemas [...] all present + phase index [B] + ...`) satisfies C-50
while preserving C-47, C-48, and C-49 unchanged. The inline halt annotation satisfies
C-48 but not C-51. The mechanism difference between inline halt and labeled THRESHOLD
field is the isolated variable for C-51.

SKILL EXECUTION CONTRACT
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

All output templates, constraint rules, phase authorization, and null obligations are
pre-declared below. Every phase executes against this contract and may audit against it.

§1  SCHEMA A TEMPLATE
    D-N | Dimension label | Current value
    Source: strategy.md (filled before any signal is examined).
    Null behavior: all strategy dimensions must appear; no row may be omitted.
    Phase authorization: Phase 1 only.

§2  VERBATIM BLOCK TEMPLATE
    ===VERBATIM BLOCK START===
    "[exact quoted sentence from strategy.md]"
    Source dimension: D-N -- [label matching a Schema A row]
    Enforcement note: A Source dimension field not matching a D-N label in Schema A
                      at seal time is a SEAL violation and fails this block.
    ===VERBATIM BLOCK END===
    Phase authorization: Phase 1 only.

§3  SEALED BLOCK TEMPLATE
    ===STRATEGY SEALED===
    Schema A: COMPLETE
    VERBATIM BLOCK: PRESENT -- D-N source, enforcement note labeled
    Temporal attestation: Commitment phase complete. No signal artifacts read yet.
    Re-read prohibition: strategy.md may not be re-opened until user applies changes. [R-1]
    SEAL violation: A Before value not in Schema A at seal time is a SEAL violation. [R-2]
    ===STRATEGY SEALED===
    Phase authorization: Phase 1 only.

§4  NAMESPACE INVENTORY TABLE TEMPLATE
    namespace | total artifacts | new (date > STRATEGY DATE)
    All 9 namespaces listed. Absent: 0 total | 0 new.
    missing row != absent namespace -- a missing row means the namespace was not checked.
    Phase authorization: Phase 2 only.

§5  PROPOSAL SCOPE BLOCK TEMPLATE
    HIGH-PRESSURE NAMESPACES: [namespaces with new > 0; "none" if list is empty]
    Evidence restriction: Only HIGH-PRESSURE namespace artifacts may support proposals.
    SCOPE violation: A proposal row citing an excluded namespace is a SCOPE violation.
    missing block != null -- a missing §5 block means the scope filter was not applied.
    Phase authorization: Phase 5 only.

§6  PROPOSALS TABLE TEMPLATE
    Action | Proposal | Before (from §1 Schema A) | After | Evidence artifact |
    Why this beats NO CHANGE [R-0]
    Action types: ADD / REMOVE / REPRIORITIZE.
    Null row: "[TYPE]: none -- inertia holds [R-0]."
    missing null row != no proposals -- a missing null row means the type was not evaluated.
    Phase authorization: Phase 5 only.

§7  GATE BLOCK TEMPLATE
    [PHASE N GATE: PASS/STOP -- condition: ...]
    Compound gates use [Na][Nb][Nc] labels on sub-conditions.
    Phase authorization: any gate phase.

§8  CONFLICT AUDIT BLOCK TEMPLATE
    Conflict audit: [typed null "no cross-artifact contradictions found"
                     or contradiction table: Artifact A | Artifact B | Dimension | Contradiction]
    missing block != null -- a missing §8 block means the audit was not run.
    Phase authorization: Phase 4 only.

PHASE AUTHORIZATION INDEX:
  Phase 1 -- §1 §2 §3 §7
  Phase 2 -- §4 §7
  Phase 3 -- §7 only
  Phase 4 -- §8 §7
  Phase 5 -- §5 §6 §7
  Phase 6 -- §7 (confirmation variant) only
  Phase 7 -- write to strategy.md (post-confirmation only)

CONSTRAINT RULES:
  R-0: Default outcome is NO CHANGE. Every proposal must prove that leaving the strategy
       unchanged produces a worse outcome than the proposed change. A proposal unable to
       name a concrete consequence of NOT changing fails R-0 and must be dropped.
  R-1: strategy.md sealed after §3. May not be re-read before user confirmation.
  R-2: Before values in §6 must trace to §1 Schema A rows at seal time. A Before value
       not in Schema A at seal time is a SEAL violation and must be dropped.
  R-3: Evidence restricted to artifacts dated after STRATEGY DATE. Evidence from prior
       artifacts is ineligible regardless of namespace.
  R-4: Enforcement reproductions cite both contract name and §ID (double-anchored attribution).

CONSTRAINT SCOPE INDEX:
  R-0: Phases 5-6 (active during proposal evaluation and confirmation framing)
  R-1: Phases 1-6 (active from §3 seal through Phase 6 confirmation)
  R-2: Phase 5 only (Before-value sourcing in §6 proposals table)
  R-3: Phases 4-5 (delta detection in Phase 4; proposal evidence in Phase 5)
  R-4: Phase 5 only (§5 PROPOSAL SCOPE and §6 reproductions)

PHASE SEQUENCE:
  Phase 1 (Commitment) -> Phase 2 (Inventory) -> Phase 3 (Gate) ->
  Phase 4 (Reading + Conflict Audit) -> Phase 5 (Proposals) ->
  Phase 6 (Confirmation -- halt) -> Phase 7 (Apply -- only after YES or REVISED)

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Gate-0 -- CONTRACT COMPLETENESS GATE
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before Phase 1 begins, verify the SKILL EXECUTION CONTRACT above is complete.

  8 declared schemas + 3 structural checks = 11 items.
  Gate-0 passes when all 11 items confirmed; one STOP result halts Phase 1.

  Schema checks -- one item per declared §ID:
  Check [A1]: §1 SCHEMA A -- columns D-N | Dimension label | Current value present,
              null behavior "no row may be omitted" present, phase authorization Phase 1?
  Check [A2]: §2 VERBATIM BLOCK -- delimiters present, Source dimension field present,
              Enforcement note field present, phase authorization Phase 1?
  Check [A3]: §3 SEALED BLOCK -- Schema A complete field present, VERBATIM BLOCK present
              field present, Temporal attestation present, Re-read prohibition [R-1] present,
              SEAL violation [R-2] present, phase authorization Phase 1?
  Check [A4]: §4 NAMESPACE INVENTORY TABLE -- columns namespace | total artifacts | new
              present, missing-row annotation present, phase authorization Phase 2?
  Check [A5]: §5 PROPOSAL SCOPE BLOCK -- HIGH-PRESSURE NAMESPACES field present, Evidence
              restriction present, SCOPE violation line present, missing-block annotation
              present, phase authorization Phase 5?
  Check [A6]: §6 PROPOSALS TABLE -- columns Action | Proposal | Before | After | Evidence
              artifact | Why present, null row format present, missing-null annotation present,
              phase authorization Phase 5?
  Check [A7]: §7 GATE BLOCK -- [PHASE N GATE: PASS/STOP] format present, compound [Na][Nb]
              labeling present, phase authorization "any gate phase" present?
  Check [A8]: §8 CONFLICT AUDIT BLOCK -- typed null or contradiction table format present,
              missing-block annotation present, phase authorization Phase 4?

  Structural checks:
  Check [B]: PHASE AUTHORIZATION INDEX present and populated?
    All 7 phases (Phase 1 through Phase 7) listed with their authorized §IDs.
  Check [C]: CONSTRAINT SCOPE INDEX present and populated?
    All R-N rules (R-0 through R-4) listed with their active phase ranges.
  Check [D]: Null annotations present on all typed-null-capable sections?
    §4 "missing row != absent namespace"
    §5 "missing block != null"
    §6 "missing null row != no proposals"
    §8 "missing block != null"

  Item count: 11 items ([A1][A2][A3][A4][A5][A6][A7][A8][B][C][D]) = 8 schemas + 3 structural.
  A missing §ID produces a detectable missing check item, not a silently failing compound condition.

  [GATE-0: PASS/STOP -- condition: schemas [A1][A2][A3][A4][A5][A6][A7][A8] all present +
  phase index [B] complete + constraint index [C] complete + null annotations [D] all present;
  reading this condition line enumerates all 11 required items; no item may be inferred by range]

## V-02: Output Format -- Labeled THRESHOLD Field on Attestation+Flat Base

**Variation axis**: Output format -- single axis. The Gate-0 annotation is restructured
from R15 V-05 (inline halt in annotation sentence) to a dedicated labeled field: "GATE-0
PASS THRESHOLD: passes when all 11 items confirmed; blocked by any single STOP result."
The condition line retains the flat AND-conjunction from R15 V-05 (C-50 absent) and the
self-containment attestation (C-49 preserved). C-48 is satisfied by the halt trigger in
the labeled field. C-51 is satisfied by the labeled-field co-location. C-50 is
deliberately absent -- the flat AND-conjunction is preserved unchanged.

**Hypothesis**: C-51 requires pass threshold and halt declaration to appear within a
single dedicated labeled structural field, independently locatable by field-name scan.
R15 V-05 satisfies C-48 and C-49 via an inline sentence ("Gate-0 passes when all 11
items confirmed; one STOP result halts Phase 1") appended to the arithmetic
decomposition. Both pass threshold and halt trigger are present (C-46, C-48), but they
appear as clauses in a running sentence rather than as a named field. V-02 tests whether
extracting both clauses into "GATE-0 PASS THRESHOLD: ..." satisfies C-51 while the flat
AND-conjunction condition line (no category grouping) continues to fail C-50. Attestation
is preserved (C-49 carries forward). The sole addition over R15 V-05 is C-51.

  R-2: Before values in §6 must trace to §1 Schema A rows at seal time. A Before value
       not in Schema A at seal time is a SEAL violation and must be dropped.
  R-3: Evidence restricted to artifacts dated after STRATEGY DATE. Evidence from prior
       artifacts is ineligible regardless of namespace.

Gate-0 -- CONTRACT COMPLETENESS GATE
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before Phase 1 begins, verify the SKILL EXECUTION CONTRACT above is complete.

  Arithmetic decomposition: 8 declared schemas + 3 structural checks = 11 items.
  GATE-0 PASS THRESHOLD: passes when all 11 items confirmed; blocked by any single STOP result.

  Schema checks -- one item per declared §ID:
  Check [A1]: §1 SCHEMA A -- columns D-N | Dimension label | Current value present,
              null behavior "no row may be omitted" present, phase authorization Phase 1?
  Check [A2]: §2 VERBATIM BLOCK -- delimiters present, Source dimension field present,
              Enforcement note field present, phase authorization Phase 1?
  Check [A3]: §3 SEALED BLOCK -- Schema A complete field present, VERBATIM BLOCK present

              present, missing-row annotation present, phase authorization Phase 2?
  Check [A5]: §5 PROPOSAL SCOPE BLOCK -- HIGH-PRESSURE NAMESPACES field present, Evidence
              restriction present, SCOPE violation line present, missing-block annotation
              present, phase authorization Phase 5?

## V-03: Phrasing Register -- Grouped + Labeled THRESHOLD Without Attestation

**Variation axis**: Phrasing register -- single axis. Gate-0 combines the grouped
condition-line format (C-50: `schemas [A1]...[A8] all present + phase index [B] +
constraint index [C] + null annotations [D]`) with the labeled THRESHOLD field (C-51:
`GATE-0 PASS THRESHOLD: passes when all 11 items confirmed; blocked by any single STOP
result`). The self-containment attestation clause (C-49: "reading this condition line
enumerates all N items required; no item may be inferred by range") is deliberately
absent. This tests C-50 and C-51 as a pair without C-49, isolating whether the two new
criteria can be satisfied independently of the attestation.

**Hypothesis**: C-50 requires semantic category grouping; C-51 requires pass/halt
co-location in a dedicated labeled field. Neither criterion references the attestation
(C-49). R15 V-04 satisfied all four (C-48/C-49/C-50/C-51) in combination, but no
R15 variation tested C-50+C-51 without C-49. V-03 tests the minimal form: grouped
condition line + labeled THRESHOLD, no attestation. If C-50 and C-51 are satisfied while
C-49 fails, the scoring separation confirms that C-49 operates independently on the
condition line, regardless of grouping. The more direct phrasing (no trailing attestation
clause) is the register change -- a style preference that removes hedging while
preserving structural completeness.

You are executing the topic-plan skill: revise the signal strategy as new information arrives.

The default outcome of this skill is NO CHANGE to strategy.md.
Every proposal carries the burden of proof against leaving the strategy unchanged.

§4  NAMESPACE INVENTORY TABLE TEMPLATE
    namespace | total artifacts | new (date > STRATEGY DATE)

## V-04: Combined Lifecycle + Output Format -- C-49+C-50+C-51 Together

**Variation axis**: Combined lifecycle emphasis + output format. Gate-0 applies all three
criteria simultaneously: the grouped condition-line format (C-50), the dedicated labeled
THRESHOLD field (C-51), and the self-containment attestation (C-49). This is the R15
V-04 form, now named as the R16 combination target for C-49+C-50+C-51. Phases 1-7 carry
over unchanged from prior variations. The mechanism difference between V-04 and V-05 is
inertia framing: V-04 uses the standard R-0 per-row test; V-05 adds a dedicated NO
CHANGE EVALUATION block before proposals.

**Hypothesis**: V-01 isolated C-50 (grouped, no labeled field, with attestation). V-02
isolated C-51 (labeled field, flat, with attestation). V-03 confirmed C-50+C-51 without
C-49. V-04 tests whether grouped format + labeled THRESHOLD field + attestation satisfy
all three criteria simultaneously without interference. Specifically: the labeled
THRESHOLD field (above the checklist) and the attestation clause (at the end of the
condition line) operate at different structural positions -- V-04 tests whether their
co-presence creates any ambiguity. If the combination is coherent, V-04 establishes
the baseline for V-05 to extend with inertia framing.

The default outcome of this skill is NO CHANGE to strategy.md.
Every proposal carries the burden of proof against leaving the strategy unchanged.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SKILL EXECUTION CONTRACT
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

All output templates, constraint rules, phase authorization, and null obligations are
pre-declared below. Every phase executes against this contract and may audit against it.

§1  SCHEMA A TEMPLATE
    D-N | Dimension label | Current value
    Source: strategy.md (filled before any signal is examined).
    Null behavior: all strategy dimensions must appear; no row may be omitted.
    Phase authorization: Phase 1 only.

§2  VERBATIM BLOCK TEMPLATE
    ===VERBATIM BLOCK START===
    "[exact quoted sentence from strategy.md]"
    Source dimension: D-N -- [label matching a Schema A row]
    Enforcement note: A Source dimension field not matching a D-N label in Schema A
                      at seal time is a SEAL violation and fails this block.
    ===VERBATIM BLOCK END===
    Phase authorization: Phase 1 only.

§3  SEALED BLOCK TEMPLATE
    ===STRATEGY SEALED===
    Schema A: COMPLETE
    VERBATIM BLOCK: PRESENT -- D-N source, enforcement note labeled
    Temporal attestation: Commitment phase complete. No signal artifacts read yet.
    Re-read prohibition: strategy.md may not be re-opened until user applies changes. [R-1]
    SEAL violation: A Before value not in Schema A at seal time is a SEAL violation. [R-2]
    ===STRATEGY SEALED===
    Phase authorization: Phase 1 only.

§4  NAMESPACE INVENTORY TABLE TEMPLATE
    namespace | total artifacts | new (date > STRATEGY DATE)
    All 9 namespaces listed. Absent: 0 total | 0 new.
    missing row != absent namespace -- a missing row means the namespace was not checked.
    Phase authorization: Phase 2 only.

§5  PROPOSAL SCOPE BLOCK TEMPLATE
    HIGH-PRESSURE NAMESPACES: [namespaces with new > 0; "none" if list is empty]
    Evidence restriction: Only HIGH-PRESSURE namespace artifacts may support proposals.
    SCOPE violation: A proposal row citing an excluded namespace is a SCOPE violation.
    missing block != null -- a missing §5 block means the scope filter was not applied.
    Phase authorization: Phase 5 only.

§6  PROPOSALS TABLE TEMPLATE
    Action | Proposal | Before (from §1 Schema A) | After | Evidence artifact |
    Why this beats NO CHANGE [R-0]
    Action types: ADD / REMOVE / REPRIORITIZE.
    Null row: "[TYPE]: none -- inertia holds [R-0]."
    missing null row != no proposals -- a missing null row means the type was not evaluated.
    Phase authorization: Phase 5 only.

§7  GATE BLOCK TEMPLATE
    [PHASE N GATE: PASS/STOP -- condition: ...]
    Compound gates use [Na][Nb][Nc] labels on sub-conditions.
    Phase authorization: any gate phase.

§8  CONFLICT AUDIT BLOCK TEMPLATE
    Conflict audit: [typed null "no cross-artifact contradictions found"
                     or contradiction table: Artifact A | Artifact B | Dimension | Contradiction]
    missing block != null -- a missing §8 block means the audit was not run.
    Phase authorization: Phase 4 only.

PHASE AUTHORIZATION INDEX:
  Phase 1 -- §1 §2 §3 §7
  Phase 2 -- §4 §7
  Phase 3 -- §7 only
  Phase 4 -- §8 §7
  Phase 5 -- §5 §6 §7
  Phase 6 -- §7 (confirmation variant) only
  Phase 7 -- write to strategy.md (post-confirmation only)

CONSTRAINT RULES:
  R-0: Default outcome is NO CHANGE. Every proposal must prove that leaving the strategy
       unchanged produces a worse outcome than the proposed change. A proposal unable to
       name a concrete consequence of NOT changing fails R-0 and must be dropped.
  R-1: strategy.md sealed after §3. May not be re-read before user confirmation.
  R-2: Before values in §6 must trace to §1 Schema A rows at seal time. A Before value
       not in Schema A at seal time is a SEAL violation and must be dropped.
  R-3: Evidence restricted to artifacts dated after STRATEGY DATE. Evidence from prior
       artifacts is ineligible regardless of namespace.
  R-4: Enforcement reproductions cite both contract name and §ID (double-anchored attribution).

CONSTRAINT SCOPE INDEX:
  R-0: Phases 5-6 (active during proposal evaluation and confirmation framing)
  R-1: Phases 1-6 (active from §3 seal through Phase 6 confirmation)
  R-2: Phase 5 only (Before-value sourcing in §6 proposals table)
  R-3: Phases 4-5 (delta detection in Phase 4; proposal evidence in Phase 5)
  R-4: Phase 5 only (§5 PROPOSAL SCOPE and §6 reproductions)

  Item count: 11 items ([A1][A2][A3][A4][A5][A6][A7][A8][B][C][D]) = 8 schemas + 3 structural.
  A missing §ID produces a detectable missing check item, not a silently failing compound condition.

## V-05: Full Ceiling -- Combined All Axes (C-43--C-51)

**Variation axis**: Combined lifecycle emphasis + output format + inertia framing. Gate-0
carries all three new criteria from V-04 (grouped condition line C-50, labeled THRESHOLD
field C-51, attestation C-49). The inertia framing axis is added in Phase 5: before the
§6 proposals table, a dedicated §5b NO CHANGE EVALUATION block explicitly names the
strategy status quo as a competing option, evaluates it against signal evidence per
dimension, and declares an outcome. This converts R-0 from a per-row test to an upfront
named competitor. §5b is declared in the contract and authorized in Phase 5.

**Hypothesis**: The C-49+C-50+C-51 combination in Gate-0 was confirmed by V-04. V-05
tests whether adding §5b (inertia framing) changes any other criterion behavior.
Specific question: does the NO CHANGE EVALUATION block make R-0 more structurally
explicit than the per-row "Why this beats NO CHANGE" column alone? V-05 is also the
ceiling test for all nine criteria introduced since R13 (C-43 through C-51), confirming
that every criterion is simultaneously satisfiable in a single coherent prompt. The
additional §5b schema raises the item count in Gate-0 from 11 to 12, testing whether
the grouped condition line scales cleanly when a new schema is added.

You are executing the topic-plan skill: revise the signal strategy as new information arrives.

The default outcome of this skill is NO CHANGE to strategy.md.
Every proposal carries the burden of proof against leaving the strategy unchanged.
NO CHANGE is not a fallback -- it is the named default option that proposals must
explicitly defeat, dimension by dimension, against new signal evidence.

    SEAL violation: A Before value not in Schema A at seal time is a SEAL violation. [R-2]
    ===STRATEGY SEALED===
    Phase authorization: Phase 1 only.

§4  NAMESPACE INVENTORY TABLE TEMPLATE
    namespace | total artifacts | new (date > STRATEGY DATE)
    All 9 namespaces listed. Absent: 0 total | 0 new.
    missing row != absent namespace -- a missing row means the namespace was not checked.
    Phase authorization: Phase 2 only.

§5  PROPOSAL SCOPE BLOCK TEMPLATE
    HIGH-PRESSURE NAMESPACES: [namespaces with new > 0; "none" if list is empty]
    Evidence restriction: Only HIGH-PRESSURE namespace artifacts may support proposals.
    SCOPE violation: A proposal row citing an excluded namespace is a SCOPE violation.
    missing block != null -- a missing §5 block means the scope filter was not applied.
    Phase authorization: Phase 5 only.

§5b NO CHANGE EVALUATION BLOCK TEMPLATE
    NO CHANGE EVALUATION [R-0]:
    Status quo dimensions: [every §1 Schema A D-N label with current value]
    New signal pressure: [HIGH-PRESSURE namespaces with artifact counts; "none" if empty]
    Evaluation: [for each dimension under new signal pressure, state whether the new
                 signal evidence reveals a concrete consequence of NOT changing that
                 dimension; "no pressure" is a valid finding for dimensions with no coverage]
    Outcome: NO CHANGE HOLDS / PARTIAL CHANGE WARRANTED / FULL CHANGE WARRANTED
    Null behavior: if no HIGH-PRESSURE namespaces, write "Outcome: NO CHANGE HOLDS --
                   no new signals since strategy date."
    missing block != null -- a missing §5b block means the inertia evaluation was not run.
    Phase authorization: Phase 5 only (after §5 PROPOSAL SCOPE, before §6 PROPOSALS TABLE).

§6  PROPOSALS TABLE TEMPLATE
    Action | Proposal | Before (from §1 Schema A) | After | Evidence artifact |
    Why this beats NO CHANGE [R-0]
    Action types: ADD / REMOVE / REPRIORITIZE.
    Null row: "[TYPE]: none -- inertia holds [R-0]."
    missing null row != no proposals -- a missing null row means the type was not evaluated.
    Phase authorization: Phase 5 only (after §5b NO CHANGE EVALUATION).

§7  GATE BLOCK TEMPLATE
    [PHASE N GATE: PASS/STOP -- condition: ...]
    Compound gates use [Na][Nb][Nc] labels on sub-conditions.
    Phase authorization: any gate phase.

§8  CONFLICT AUDIT BLOCK TEMPLATE
    Conflict audit: [typed null "no cross-artifact contradictions found"
                     or contradiction table: Artifact A | Artifact B | Dimension | Contradiction]
    missing block != null -- a missing §8 block means the audit was not run.
    Phase authorization: Phase 4 only.

PHASE AUTHORIZATION INDEX:
  Phase 1 -- §1 §2 §3 §7
  Phase 2 -- §4 §7
  Phase 3 -- §7 only
  Phase 4 -- §8 §7
  Phase 5 -- §5 §5b §6 §7
  Phase 6 -- §7 (confirmation variant) only
  Phase 7 -- write to strategy.md (post-confirmation only)

CONSTRAINT RULES:
  R-0: Default outcome is NO CHANGE. Every proposal must prove that leaving the strategy
       unchanged produces a worse outcome than the proposed change. A proposal unable to
       name a concrete consequence of NOT changing fails R-0 and must be dropped.
       NO CHANGE is evaluated first as a named option in §5b before any proposals are
       generated; proposals must beat the §5b evaluation outcome for that dimension.
  R-1: strategy.md sealed after §3. May not be re-read before user confirmation.
  R-2: Before values in §6 must trace to §1 Schema A rows at seal time. A Before value
       not in Schema A at seal time is a SEAL violation and must be dropped.
  R-3: Evidence restricted to artifacts dated after STRATEGY DATE. Evidence from prior
       artifacts is ineligible regardless of namespace.
  R-4: Enforcement reproductions cite both contract name and §ID (double-anchored attribution).

CONSTRAINT SCOPE INDEX:
  R-0: Phases 5-6 (§5b evaluation, §6 proposal generation, and confirmation framing)
  R-1: Phases 1-6 (active from §3 seal through Phase 6 confirmation)
  R-2: Phase 5 only (Before-value sourcing in §6 proposals table)
  R-3: Phases 4-5 (delta detection in Phase 4; proposal evidence in Phase 5)
  R-4: Phase 5 only (§5, §5b, and §6 reproductions)

PHASE SEQUENCE:
  Phase 1 (Commitment) -> Phase 2 (Inventory) -> Phase 3 (Gate) ->
  Phase 4 (Reading + Conflict Audit) -> Phase 5 (Proposals) ->
  Phase 6 (Confirmation -- halt) -> Phase 7 (Apply -- only after YES or REVISED)

Gate-0 -- CONTRACT COMPLETENESS GATE
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before Phase 1 begins, verify the SKILL EXECUTION CONTRACT above is complete.

  Arithmetic decomposition: 9 declared schemas ([A1] through [A9]) + 3 structural checks
  ([B][C][D]) = 12 items total.
  GATE-0 PASS THRESHOLD: passes when all 12 items confirmed; blocked by any single STOP result.

  Schema checks -- one item per declared §ID:

  Check [A4]: §4 NAMESPACE INVENTORY TABLE -- columns namespace | total artifacts | new
              present, missing-row annotation present, phase authorization Phase 2?
  Check [A5]: §5 PROPOSAL SCOPE BLOCK -- HIGH-PRESSURE NAMESPACES field present, Evidence
              restriction present, SCOPE violation line present, missing-block annotation
              present, phase authorization Phase 5?

              null behavior for zero-pressure case present, missing-block annotation present,
              phase authorization Phase 5 (after §5, before §6)?
  Check [A7]: §6 PROPOSALS TABLE -- columns Action | Proposal | Before | After | Evidence
              artifact | Why present, null row format present, missing-null annotation present,
              phase authorization Phase 5 (after §5b)?

  Check [A9]: §8 CONFLICT AUDIT BLOCK -- typed null or contradiction table format present,
              missing-block annotation present, phase authorization Phase 4?

  Structural checks:
  Check [B]: PHASE AUTHORIZATION INDEX present and populated?
    All 7 phases listed with authorized §IDs.
    Phase 5 must list §5, §5b, §6, and §7.
  Check [C]: CONSTRAINT SCOPE INDEX present and populated?
    All R-N rules (R-0 through R-4) listed with active phase ranges.
    R-0 must reference §5b evaluation in its scope description.

    §5 "missing block != null"
    §5b "missing block != null"
    §6 "missing null row != no proposals"
    §8 "missing block != null"

  Item count: 12 items ([A1][A2][A3][A4][A5][A6][A7][A8][A9][B][C][D]) = 9 schemas + 3 structural.
  A missing §ID produces a detectable missing check item, not a silently failing compound condition.

  [GATE-0: PASS/STOP -- condition: schemas [A1][A2][A3][A4][A5][A6][A7][A8][A9] all present +
  phase index [B] complete + constraint index [C] complete + null annotations [D] all present;
  reading this condition line enumerates all 12 required items; no item may be inferred by range]
