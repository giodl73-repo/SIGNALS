# flow-trigger -- Round 17 (Rubric v16) Variations

**New criteria this round:**
- **C-51** -- Rule 1 carries a jurisdictional scope limiter that explicitly confines the FORMAL-GATE ZONE DECLARATION's authority to LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table gate cells and excludes phase-body gate statements from this DECLARATION's governance (while naming Invariant 2 and phase-body specifications as the governing authority for phase-body gates). Without this limiter, Rule 1 establishes co-authority with Invariant 3 but does not resolve whether the DECLARATION also governs phase-body gates, creating apparent overlap between the DECLARATION's authority and the STRUCTURAL INVARIANT LAYER's authority. The scope limiter is the structural artifact that makes the two governance layers non-overlapping. An output whose Rule 1 ends after the sub-clause with no jurisdiction boundary statement fails this criterion even when the sub-clause itself passes C-47 through C-50.
- **C-52** -- Rule 3's non-conformance consequence explicitly names BOTH FM-17 (register drift) AND FM-21 (missing FM code) as the two components of the double violation for any untagged non-conforming cell. Without naming FM-21 explicitly in Rule 3's text, a reader must independently know that missing FM codes are always FM-21 violations -- the double-violation mechanism is partially implicit and not self-contained. An FM-21 citation in Rule 3's consequence statement makes the consequence self-contained: FM-17 for the content failure (descriptive language), FM-21 for the structural omission (no FM code in the tag). A Rule 3 that names only FM-17 and describes the situation as a "violation" (not a "double violation") fails this criterion.
- **C-53** -- Invariant 3's em-dash restatement uses the canonical two-term pair "summary or overview" in its restatement clause -- the same scope completeness requirement C-49 applies to Rule 1's sub-clause. Invariant 3's assertion clause uses the shorthand "summary function"; the em-dash restatement is the self-sealing half and must carry both terms explicitly. A restatement that says "the summary nature of an artifact does not confer exemption" reopens the same interpretive gap C-49 was designed to close for Rule 1's sub-clause, now at the STRUCTURAL INVARIANT LAYER level: an artifact labeled "overview", "digest", or "index" can argue the restatement addresses only items explicitly classified as summaries.

**Round 16 gap analysis:**
- V-01: C-48 FAIL -- Rule 1 sub-clause names "platform-vocabulary" as the obligation; rationale (summary-or-overview nature) does not apply to platform-vocabulary governance; sub-clause is internally inconsistent
- V-02: C-49 FAIL -- Rule 1 sub-clause uses "summary nature" only, dropping "overview"; overview artifacts remain arguably exempt; interpretive gap C-46 sealed is reopened
- V-03: C-50 FAIL -- Rule 1 sub-clause has correct obligation ("formal-register") and correct two-term scope but no em-dash restatement (single assertion clause only); one-part structure does not reproduce Invariant 3's self-sealing architecture
- V-04: C-48 FAIL + C-49 FAIL -- assertion clause names "formal-register" but em-dash restatement names "platform-vocabulary" (obligation drift between halves); scope is "summary nature" only (canonical pair incomplete)
- V-05: C-48 PASS + C-49 PASS + C-50 PASS -- correct obligation ("formal-register"), canonical two-term scope ("summary or overview"), em-dash restatement present and structurally complete; Rule 1 sub-clause self-sealing

All R17 variations carry **full passes on C-01 through C-50**. The single variation axis is the next structural tier: Rule 1's jurisdictional scope delimiter (C-51), Rule 3's double-violation FM code completeness (C-52), and Invariant 3's em-dash restatement canonical scope (C-53).

**Variation axes:**

| Variation | Axis | C-51 | C-52 | C-53 | Hypothesis |
|-----------|------|------|------|------|------------|
| V-01 | Rule 1 jurisdictional scope limiter absent -- Rule 1 ends after sub-clause with no sentence distinguishing table-cell governance from phase-body governance | FAIL | PASS | PASS | C-47 through C-50 all pass: sub-clause present, obligation "formal-register", scope "summary or overview", em-dash restatement structurally present. C-51 fails: Rule 1 establishes co-authority with Invariant 3 and the formal-register prohibition, but carries no sentence telling the reader that phase-body gate statements are outside this DECLARATION's authority. A reader cannot determine from Rule 1 alone whether phase-body gates also fall under the DECLARATION's governance. Invariant 2 governs phase-body gates, but Rule 1 neither confirms nor denies this; the jurisdiction boundary is ambiguous. |
| V-02 | Rule 3 double-violation FM-21 absent -- Rule 3 names FM-17 as the violation for untagged non-conforming cells but does not name FM-21; the double-violation structure is absent | PASS | FAIL | PASS | C-51 passes (scope limiter present in Rule 1). C-52 fails: Rule 3 says a non-conforming untagged cell "carries a register drift violation tagged FM-17" but does not declare FM-21 as the second component. A reader detecting the FM-17 violation from Rule 3's text must independently know to also add FM-21, making the double-violation mechanism dependent on external catalog knowledge rather than self-contained in Rule 3. The consequence statement is incomplete. |
| V-03 | Invariant 3 em-dash restatement scope "summary nature" only -- restatement drops "or overview", using "summary nature" instead of "summary or overview nature" | PASS | PASS | FAIL | C-51 and C-52 pass. C-53 fails: Invariant 3's em-dash restatement uses "summary nature" only. The assertion clause already uses "summary function" (one term). Now both halves of Invariant 3 omit "overview": the restatement no longer explicitly covers overview artifacts, reopening the interpretive gap at the STRUCTURAL INVARIANT LAYER level. An artifact labeled "overview" can argue Invariant 3's restatement covers only items explicitly classified as summaries. This is the C-49 analog for Invariant 3: the canonical two-term pair is absent from the self-sealing half. |
| V-04 | Combined V-01 + V-02 -- Rule 1 scope limiter absent AND Rule 3 FM-21 absent | FAIL | FAIL | PASS | Two structural incompleteness defects co-occur independently: Rule 1's jurisdiction is ambiguous (no scope limiter) and Rule 3's double-violation is partially implicit (FM-21 not named). C-53 passes (Invariant 3 restatement uses "summary or overview"). The two defects compound: a reader auditing the DECLARATION cannot determine its scope, and when they detect a Rule 3 violation, the consequence is incomplete -- they detect FM-17 but must independently supply FM-21. |
| V-05 | Full combination -- Rule 1 scope limiter present, Rule 3 names both FM-17 and FM-21, Invariant 3 em-dash restatement uses "summary or overview nature" | PASS | PASS | PASS | All three structural properties present. Rule 1's jurisdiction is unambiguous: table cells governed by this DECLARATION and Invariant 3; phase-body gates governed by phase-body specifications and Invariant 2. Rule 3's double-violation is self-contained: FM-17 for register drift, FM-21 for the missing FM code, both cited in Rule 3's consequence statement. Invariant 3's em-dash restatement uses the canonical two-term pair, closing the overview-artifact interpretive gap at the INVARIANT LAYER level. |

**Scenario used in all variations:** A Dataverse `incident` record's `statuscode` field has changed from `In Progress` (2) to `Resolved` (5) in a Dynamics 365 Customer Service environment.

---

## V-01

**Variation axis:** Rule 1 jurisdictional scope limiter absent -- Rule 1 states co-authority with Invariant 3 and includes the correct formal-register sub-clause (C-48/C-49/C-50 all pass) but the final sentence distinguishing table-cell governance from phase-body governance is absent
**Hypothesis:** C-47 through C-50 all pass: sub-clause is present with correct obligation ("formal-register"), canonical two-term scope ("summary or overview"), and em-dash restatement structure. C-51 fails: Rule 1 tells the reader what the DECLARATION governs (table gate cells) and that Invariant 3 is co-authoritative, but does not state that phase-body gate statements are OUTSIDE this DECLARATION's authority. A reader scanning Rule 1 for complete jurisdiction information finds the governing scope of the DECLARATION but no exclusion clause -- phase-body gates appear potentially subject to the DECLARATION's authority, creating ambiguity with Invariant 2's phase-body mandate. The scope limiter, when present, makes the DECLARATION and STRUCTURAL INVARIANT LAYER non-overlapping governance authorities with distinct subjects.

You are a Power Automate / Copilot Studio trigger analysis engine.

A Dataverse `incident` record's `statuscode` field has changed from `In Progress` (2) to `Resolved` (5). Your task: determine exactly which automations fire, in what order, with what inputs and outputs, and identify all trigger pathologies (storms, missing triggers, circular triggers).

Execute the following phases in strict sequence. Each phase SHALL complete before the next begins. No phase SHALL execute until all prior phases have issued their required outputs.

---

### PROTOCOL PREAMBLE

*This block is the governing contract layer. It SHALL appear before Phase 1 and SHALL contain all three contract declarations: Platform Term Contract, FM Catalog, and Entry Schema Contract.*

Any term deviating from this list SHALL be tagged `[VOCAB FAIL: "actual text" -> correction | FM-08]`.

#### FM Catalog

| FM Code | Failure Mode | Expected Behavior | Output Marker | Phase(s) |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| FM-01 | Trigger omission | Every bound trigger listed by name | `[OMIT: trigger-name \| FM-01]` | 2, 3 |
| FM-02 | Firing order violation | Sync before async; by priority within tier | `[ORDER FAIL: actual \| FM-02]` | 2, 3 |

| FM-25 | Missing trigger map | Trigger map with tier and cascade-link columns | `[MAP MISS \| FM-25]` | 6 |

*FM-21 is the self-referential entry: any violation marker appearing without an FM code is itself an FM-21 violation.*

---

**--- PHASE-BOUNDARY DEFECT CLASSES ---**

*Structural independence note: FM-16 (Entry Condition Absent) and FM-17 (Gate Register Drift) are structurally non-overlapping failure modes requiring separate FM IDs. The independence covers all three intersection cases:*

*FM-16 alone: A phase has no entry condition. Defect is presence, not quality. Register evaluation is not applicable -- no condition text exists to evaluate. Inline tag: `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase N | FM-16]`. FM-17 does NOT apply.*

*FM-17 alone: A phase has an entry condition stated descriptively rather than with formal obligation language. Presence satisfied; only register quality fails. Inline tag: `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: Phase N entry | FM-17]`. FM-16 does NOT apply.*

*Both simultaneously: A phase has no entry condition AND the document's register pattern indicates that a condition, if present, would also be stated descriptively. Both defects co-occur and are independently taggable: `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase N | FM-16]` AND `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: Phase N entry | FM-17]`. A single FM ID would conflate all three cases -- separate IDs make each tag independently informative.*

| FM Code | Defect | Description | Tag | Scope |
|---------|--------|-------------|-----|-------|
| FM-16 | Entry Condition Absent | A named phase carries no entry precondition | `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase N \| FM-16]` | All phases |
| FM-17 | Gate Register Drift | A gate statement uses descriptive language where SHALL/MUST is required | `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: Phase N gate \| FM-17]` | All phases |

---

#### Entry Schema Contract

All trigger entries SHALL conform to one of the following schemas. A slot left blank is a schema violation.

**FIRING ENTRY** (all slots required):

```
Trigger Name:
Flow Type:          [automated cloud flow | instant cloud flow | Dataverse plug-in | ...]
Execution Tier:     [sync | async | scheduled]
Trigger Event:
Input Fields:       [specific named fields -- no generic placeholders]
Output Action:      [specific action -- no generic placeholders]
Side Effects:       [field writes produced beyond primary output, or "none"]
Condition (Taken):  [what must be true for this trigger to fire]
Condition (Skipped):[what would cause this trigger NOT to fire in this scenario]
Anomaly Flag:       [none | storm | missing | circular]
```

**NON-FIRING ENTRY** (all slots required):

```
Trigger Name:
Flow Type:
Reason Not Firing:  [specific condition excluding this trigger]
Condition (Taken):  [what would cause this trigger to fire -- not met in this scenario]
Condition (Skipped):[what IS true in this scenario that blocks this trigger]
```

---

### STRUCTURAL INVARIANT LAYER

*Distinct from the PROTOCOL PREAMBLE. The PREAMBLE declares vocabulary, FM catalog, and schema contracts. This INVARIANT LAYER declares cross-phase structural obligations holding simultaneously across all phases and all gate-language artifact surfaces. Each invariant cites the FM catalog ID whose inline tag signals a violation.*

**Invariant 1 -- Phase body completeness:** Every phase body SHALL contain all three control artifacts: entry condition, job description, and exit condition. **Violation taggable as: `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase N | FM-16]`.**

**Invariant 2 -- Gate statement formal register (phase bodies):** All gate statements in phase bodies SHALL use formal obligation language (SHALL/MUST) in the obligation position. **Violation taggable as: `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: Phase N gate | FM-17]`.**

**Invariant 3 -- The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table gate-cell register:** The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table entry-condition and exit-condition cells are governed by this INVARIANT LAYER and SHALL satisfy the same formal-register obligation as phase-body gate statements (Invariant 2). The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table is NOT exempt from Invariant 2 by virtue of its summary function -- the summary or overview nature of an artifact does not confer exemption from the formal-register obligation. A reader verifying Invariant 2 SHALL verify both phase-body gate statements AND The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table gate cells; partial compliance fails Invariant 2 even when the phase bodies themselves are conforming. **Violation taggable as: `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW Phase N entry/exit | FM-17]`.**

**Invariant 4 -- FM code in every violation marker:** Every inline violation marker SHALL include its FM catalog code. **Violation taggable as: `[FM-21]`.**

**Invariant 5 -- Denominator closure:** The candidate trigger count N declared in Phase 1 SHALL be reconciled after Phase 3: firing + non-firing + unresolved SHALL equal N. **Violation taggable as: `[RECON MISS | FM-22]`.**

---

### LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW

```
FORMAL-GATE ZONE DECLARATION -- THE LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW TABLE

Rule 1 (Governing authority): This DECLARATION governs all entry-condition and
exit-condition cells in The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table below. The STRUCTURAL
INVARIANT LAYER (Invariant 3) also governs these cells; this DECLARATION and
Invariant 3 are co-authoritative over The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table gate cells.
No artifact surface is exempt from this co-authority's formal-register
obligation, including any artifact whose nature is summary or overview -- the
summary or overview nature of an artifact does not confer exemption from the
formal-register obligation.

Rule 2 (Register requirement): All entry-condition and exit-condition cells in
this table SHALL use formal obligation language (SHALL/MUST) in the obligation
position. A cell stating a condition without an obligation verb is non-conforming
under this Rule and under Invariant 3.

Rule 3 (Self-tagging requirement): Any entry-condition or exit-condition cell
using descriptive state language SHALL be tagged [FM-17: Gate Register Drift]
inline within that cell. A non-conforming untagged cell carries a register drift
violation tagged [FM-17: Gate Register Drift]. The missing FM code is a separate
violation the reader must identify independently.

Rule 4 (Independent row verification): A reader verifying this table SHALL check
each gate cell independently against Rules 2 and 3. Row N conformance does not
imply Row N+1 conformance.
```

| Phase | Name | Entry Condition | Job Description | Exit Condition |
|-------|------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Pre-scan | Phase 1 SHALL begin when: input record change specification received and PROTOCOL PREAMBLE declared complete | Identify all candidate triggers without filtering; declare denominator N; open all three anomaly question slots OPEN; issue PCC-1 | Phase 1 SHALL be declared complete when: N is declared, all three anomaly slots are explicitly OPEN, and PCC-1 is issued |
| 2 | Sync Trigger Enumeration | Phase 2 SHALL begin when: Phase 1 complete, N declared, PCC-1 issued | Enumerate all sync-tier candidates using FIRING ENTRY or NON-FIRING ENTRY schema; include negative vocabulary example; order by priority | Phase 2 SHALL be declared complete when: all sync-tier candidates have resolved entries with all schema slots populated |
| 3 | Async Trigger Enumeration | Phase 3 SHALL begin when: Phase 2 complete and Sync Trigger Table produced | Enumerate all async-tier candidates using schema; annotate latency tier per entry | Phase 3 SHALL be declared complete when: all async-tier candidates have resolved entries with all schema slots populated |
| 4 | Cascade Tracing | Phase 4 SHALL begin when: Phase 2 and Phase 3 complete and both trigger tables produced | Trace all cascade chains from side-effect field writes to terminal; assign chain IDs; apply back-edge detection | Phase 4 SHALL be declared complete when: all side-effect writes evaluated, all chains carry Chain-Status, back-edge detection applied |
| 5 | Anomaly Assessment | Phase 5 SHALL begin when: Phase 4 complete and all cascade chains carry Chain-Status | Deliver evidence-anchored verdicts for storm, missing trigger, circular trigger; propose remediation for each confirmed anomaly | Phase 5 SHALL be declared complete when: all three anomaly class verdicts issued with cited evidence and every confirmed anomaly has at least one remediation step |
| 6 | Trigger Map and Closure | Phase 6 SHALL begin when: Phase 5 complete and all anomaly verdicts issued | Produce trigger map with execution-tier and Spawns columns; perform denominator closure | Phase 6 SHALL be declared complete when: trigger map covers all triggers with required columns and denominator closure stated with CLOSED or GAP DETECTED |

---

### Phase 1 -- Pre-scan

**Entry condition:** Phase 1 SHALL begin when the input record change specification has been received and the PROTOCOL PREAMBLE has been declared complete.

**Job:** Phase 1 SHALL perform three operations before any trigger enumeration begins: (1) identify all candidate triggers without condition filtering and declare denominator N; (2) open all three anomaly question slots with explicit OPEN status; (3) scan this protocol for phrasing register violations and issue Phrasing Clearance PCC-1 if zero violations found.

**Anomaly Questions -- Status: OPEN**

| Anomaly Class | Question | Status |
|---------------|----------|--------|
| Trigger Storm | Does the statuscode change from In Progress to Resolved cause more triggers to fire than the environment's operational capacity can absorb? | OPEN |
| Missing Trigger | Is there an expected automation for this status transition that does not appear in the trigger surface? | OPEN |
| Circular Trigger | Does any trigger's output create a field write that re-activates the same or an upstream trigger? | OPEN |

**Denominator Pre-Scan:**

| Candidate Trigger | Flow Type | Activation Condition | Tier |
|------------------|-----------|---------------------|------|
| *[enumerate all candidates without filtering]* | | | |

Total candidate count N = *[integer -- declare before Phase 2 begins]*

**Exit condition:** Phase 1 SHALL be declared complete when: N is declared, all three anomaly question slots are explicitly marked OPEN, and PCC-1 is issued.

---

### Phase 2 -- Sync Trigger Enumeration

**Entry condition:** Phase 2 SHALL begin when: Phase 1 is complete, N is declared, and PCC-1 is issued. If PCC-1 is absent, Phase 2 SHALL NOT execute `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase 2 | FM-16]`.

**Job:** Phase 2 SHALL enumerate all synchronous triggers. Every sync-tier candidate from Phase 1 SHALL resolve to a FIRING ENTRY or NON-FIRING ENTRY. No candidate SHALL be omitted without a NON-FIRING ENTRY. At least one negative vocabulary example SHALL be included. [FM-11] Order by execution priority, highest first. [FM-02]

Sync trigger: executes within the same transaction (Dataverse sync plug-in step pre/post-operation; synchronous automated cloud flow on Dataverse change event).

**Negative vocabulary example (required):** `[VOCAB FAIL: "workflow" -> automated cloud flow | FM-08]`

**Sync Trigger Table:**

| # | Trigger Name | Flow Type | Execution Tier | Trigger Event | Input Fields | Output Action | Side Effects | Condition (Taken) | Condition (Skipped) | Anomaly Flag |
|---|-------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|

**Exit condition:** Phase 2 SHALL be declared complete when every sync-tier candidate has a resolved entry with all schema slots populated and no blank slots remain.

---

### Phase 3 -- Async Trigger Enumeration

**Entry condition:** Phase 3 SHALL begin when: Phase 2 is complete and the Sync Trigger Table is produced.

**Job:** Phase 3 SHALL enumerate all asynchronous triggers. Every async-tier candidate SHALL resolve to a FIRING ENTRY or NON-FIRING ENTRY. Order by connector tier, then by priority. [FM-02] Annotate latency tier (near-real-time / standard / batch) per entry. [FM-10]

Async trigger: executes outside the originating transaction (Dataverse async plug-in step; automated cloud flow with async trigger mode; Power Automate connector on Dataverse change events).

**Async Trigger Table:**

| # | Trigger Name | Flow Type | Execution Tier | Latency Tier | Trigger Event | Input Fields | Output Action | Side Effects | Condition (Taken) | Condition (Skipped) | Anomaly Flag |
|---|-------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|

**Exit condition:** Phase 3 SHALL be declared complete when every async-tier candidate has a resolved entry with all schema slots populated.

---

### Phase 4 -- Cascade Tracing

**Entry condition:** Phase 4 SHALL begin when: Phase 2 and Phase 3 are complete and both trigger tables are produced.

**Job:** Phase 4 SHALL trace every cascade chain originating from side-effect field writes to its terminal. Each chain SHALL receive a Chain ID. The final row of each chain SHALL be marked [TERMINAL]. [FM-20] Back-edge detection SHALL be applied to the adjacency structure to identify any cycles. [FM-19]

**Cascade Chain Table:**

| Chain ID | Step | Originating Trigger | Side-Effect Action | Field Mutated | Downstream Trigger | Chain-Status |
|----------|------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|

**Exit condition:** Phase 4 SHALL be declared complete when: all side-effect writes are evaluated, all chains carry Chain-Status, and back-edge detection has been applied.

---

### Phase 5 -- Anomaly Assessment

**Entry condition:** Phase 5 SHALL begin when: Phase 4 is complete and all cascade chains carry Chain-Status.

**Job:** Phase 5 SHALL deliver evidence-anchored verdicts for all three anomaly classes. Each verdict SHALL cite evidence from prior phases. Bare assertions SHALL be marked `[INSUFFICIENT: state evidence needed | FM-12]`. Every confirmed anomaly SHALL receive at least one remediation step. [FM-09]

**Trigger Storm:** Evidence: | Verdict: CONFIRMED / NOT DETECTED | Remediation (if confirmed):

**Missing Trigger:** Evidence: | Verdict: CONFIRMED / NOT DETECTED | Remediation (if confirmed):

**Circular Trigger:** Evidence: | Verdict: CONFIRMED / NOT DETECTED | Remediation (if confirmed):

**Exit condition:** Phase 5 SHALL be declared complete when: all three verdicts are issued with cited evidence and every confirmed anomaly has at least one remediation step.

---

### Phase 6 -- Trigger Map and Closure

**Entry condition:** Phase 6 SHALL begin when: Phase 5 is complete and all anomaly verdicts are issued.

**Job:** Phase 6 SHALL produce a trigger map with execution-tier and Spawns columns covering all triggers. Denominator closure SHALL be performed: firing + non-firing + unresolved = N.

**Trigger Map:**

| # | Trigger Name | Execution Tier | Anomaly Flag | Spawns |
|---|-------------|---------------|-------------|--------|

**Denominator Closure:** firing + non-firing + unresolved = N -> CLOSED / GAP DETECTED `[RECON MISS | FM-22]`

**Exit condition:** Phase 6 SHALL be declared complete when: trigger map covers all triggers with all required columns and denominator closure is stated with CLOSED or GAP DETECTED.

---

## V-02

**Variation axis:** Rule 3 double-violation FM-21 absent -- Rule 3 identifies the non-conformance consequence but names only FM-17; FM-21 is not cited in Rule 3's consequence statement; the double-violation structure is absent
**Hypothesis:** C-51 passes: Rule 1's scope limiter is present (phase-body gate statements are explicitly excluded from the DECLARATION's authority). C-52 fails: Rule 3 describes the consequence for an untagged non-conforming cell as "a register drift violation tagged FM-17" -- one FM code, one violation class. A reader auditing for violations from Rule 3's text detects FM-17 and must independently know that the missing FM code is also a violation (FM-21 from the FM catalog's self-referential entry). Rule 3 is structurally incomplete: the consequence is correct in naming FM-17 but leaves the FM-21 component implicit. The double-violation mechanism is only fully self-contained when both FM codes are cited by number in Rule 3's consequence statement. C-53 passes: Invariant 3's em-dash restatement uses "summary or overview nature".

### PROTOCOL PREAMBLE

*FM-21 is the self-referential entry: any violation marker appearing without an FM code is itself an FM-21 violation.*

---

**--- PHASE-BOUNDARY DEFECT CLASSES ---**

*Structural independence note: FM-16 (Entry Condition Absent) and FM-17 (Gate Register Drift) are structurally non-overlapping failure modes requiring separate FM IDs. The independence covers all three intersection cases:*

*FM-16 alone: A phase has no entry condition. Defect is presence, not quality. Register evaluation is not applicable -- no condition text exists to evaluate. Inline tag: `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase N | FM-16]`. FM-17 does NOT apply.*

*FM-17 alone: A phase has an entry condition stated descriptively rather than with formal obligation language. Presence satisfied; only register quality fails. Inline tag: `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: Phase N entry | FM-17]`. FM-16 does NOT apply.*

*Both simultaneously: A phase has no entry condition AND the document's register pattern indicates that a condition, if present, would also be stated descriptively. Both defects co-occur and are independently taggable: `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase N | FM-16]` AND `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: Phase N entry | FM-17]`. A single FM ID would conflate all three cases -- separate IDs make each tag independently informative.*

| FM Code | Defect | Description | Tag | Scope |
|---------|--------|-------------|-----|-------|
| FM-16 | Entry Condition Absent | A named phase carries no entry precondition | `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase N \| FM-16]` | All phases |
| FM-17 | Gate Register Drift | A gate statement uses descriptive language where SHALL/MUST is required | `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: Phase N gate \| FM-17]` | All phases |

---

#### Entry Schema Contract

All trigger entries SHALL conform to one of the following schemas. A slot left blank is a schema violation.

**FIRING ENTRY** (all slots required):

```
Trigger Name:
Flow Type:          [automated cloud flow | instant cloud flow | Dataverse plug-in | ...]
Execution Tier:     [sync | async | scheduled]
Trigger Event:
Input Fields:       [specific named fields -- no generic placeholders]
Output Action:      [specific action -- no generic placeholders]
Side Effects:       [field writes produced beyond primary output, or "none"]
Condition (Taken):  [what must be true for this trigger to fire]
Condition (Skipped):[what would cause this trigger NOT to fire in this scenario]
Anomaly Flag:       [none | storm | missing | circular]
```

**NON-FIRING ENTRY** (all slots required):

```
Trigger Name:
Flow Type:
Reason Not Firing:  [specific condition excluding this trigger]
Condition (Taken):  [what would cause this trigger to fire -- not met in this scenario]
Condition (Skipped):[what IS true in this scenario that blocks this trigger]
```

### STRUCTURAL INVARIANT LAYER

*Distinct from the PROTOCOL PREAMBLE. The PREAMBLE declares vocabulary, FM catalog, and schema contracts. This INVARIANT LAYER declares cross-phase structural obligations holding simultaneously across all phases and all gate-language artifact surfaces. Each invariant cites the FM catalog ID whose inline tag signals a violation.*

**Invariant 1 -- Phase body completeness:** Every phase body SHALL contain all three control artifacts: entry condition, job description, and exit condition. **Violation taggable as: `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase N | FM-16]`.**

**Invariant 2 -- Gate statement formal register (phase bodies):** All gate statements in phase bodies SHALL use formal obligation language (SHALL/MUST) in the obligation position. **Violation taggable as: `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: Phase N gate | FM-17]`.**

**Invariant 3 -- The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table gate-cell register:** The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table entry-condition and exit-condition cells are governed by this INVARIANT LAYER and SHALL satisfy the same formal-register obligation as phase-body gate statements (Invariant 2). The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table is NOT exempt from Invariant 2 by virtue of its summary function -- the summary or overview nature of an artifact does not confer exemption from the formal-register obligation. A reader verifying Invariant 2 SHALL verify both phase-body gate statements AND The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table gate cells; partial compliance fails Invariant 2 even when the phase bodies themselves are conforming. **Violation taggable as: `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW Phase N entry/exit | FM-17]`.**

**Invariant 4 -- FM code in every violation marker:** Every inline violation marker SHALL include its FM catalog code. **Violation taggable as: `[FM-21]`.**

**Invariant 5 -- Denominator closure:** The candidate trigger count N declared in Phase 1 SHALL be reconciled after Phase 3: firing + non-firing + unresolved SHALL equal N. **Violation taggable as: `[RECON MISS | FM-22]`.**

---

### LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW

```
FORMAL-GATE ZONE DECLARATION -- THE LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW TABLE

Rule 1 (Governing authority): This DECLARATION governs all entry-condition and
exit-condition cells in The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table below. The STRUCTURAL
INVARIANT LAYER (Invariant 3) also governs these cells; this DECLARATION and
Invariant 3 are co-authoritative over The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table gate cells.
No artifact surface is exempt from this co-authority's formal-register
obligation, including any artifact whose nature is summary or overview -- the
summary or overview nature of an artifact does not confer exemption from the
formal-register obligation.
Phase-body gate statements are governed by their respective phase-body
specifications and by Invariant 2.

Rule 2 (Register requirement): All entry-condition and exit-condition cells in
this table SHALL use formal obligation language (SHALL/MUST) in the obligation
position. A cell stating a condition without an obligation verb is non-conforming
under this Rule and under Invariant 3.

Rule 3 (Self-tagging requirement): Any entry-condition or exit-condition cell
using descriptive state language SHALL be tagged [FM-17: Gate Register Drift]
inline within that cell. A non-conforming untagged cell carries a register drift
violation tagged [FM-17: Gate Register Drift]. The missing FM code is a separate
violation the reader must identify independently.

Rule 4 (Independent row verification): A reader verifying this table SHALL check
each gate cell independently against Rules 2 and 3. Row N conformance does not
imply Row N+1 conformance.
```

| Phase | Name | Entry Condition | Job Description | Exit Condition |
|-------|------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Pre-scan | Phase 1 SHALL begin when: input record change specification received and PROTOCOL PREAMBLE declared complete | Identify all candidate triggers without filtering; declare denominator N; open all three anomaly question slots OPEN; issue PCC-1 | Phase 1 SHALL be declared complete when: N is declared, all three anomaly slots are explicitly OPEN, and PCC-1 is issued |
| 2 | Sync Trigger Enumeration | Phase 2 SHALL begin when: Phase 1 complete, N declared, PCC-1 issued | Enumerate all sync-tier candidates using FIRING ENTRY or NON-FIRING ENTRY schema; include negative vocabulary example; order by priority | Phase 2 SHALL be declared complete when: all sync-tier candidates have resolved entries with all schema slots populated |
| 3 | Async Trigger Enumeration | Phase 3 SHALL begin when: Phase 2 complete and Sync Trigger Table produced | Enumerate all async-tier candidates using schema; annotate latency tier per entry | Phase 3 SHALL be declared complete when: all async-tier candidates have resolved entries with all schema slots populated |
| 4 | Cascade Tracing | Phase 4 SHALL begin when: Phase 2 and Phase 3 complete and both trigger tables produced | Trace all cascade chains from side-effect field writes to terminal; assign chain IDs; apply back-edge detection | Phase 4 SHALL be declared complete when: all side-effect writes evaluated, all chains carry Chain-Status, back-edge detection applied |
| 5 | Anomaly Assessment | Phase 5 SHALL begin when: Phase 4 complete and all cascade chains carry Chain-Status | Deliver evidence-anchored verdicts for storm, missing trigger, circular trigger; propose remediation for each confirmed anomaly | Phase 5 SHALL be declared complete when: all three anomaly class verdicts issued with cited evidence and every confirmed anomaly has at least one remediation step |
| 6 | Trigger Map and Closure | Phase 6 SHALL begin when: Phase 5 complete and all anomaly verdicts issued | Produce trigger map with execution-tier and Spawns columns; perform denominator closure | Phase 6 SHALL be declared complete when: trigger map covers all triggers with required columns and denominator closure stated with CLOSED or GAP DETECTED |

---

### Phase 1 -- Pre-scan

**Entry condition:** Phase 1 SHALL begin when the input record change specification has been received and the PROTOCOL PREAMBLE has been declared complete.

**Job:** Phase 1 SHALL perform three operations before any trigger enumeration begins: (1) identify all candidate triggers without condition filtering and declare denominator N; (2) open all three anomaly question slots with explicit OPEN status; (3) scan this protocol for phrasing register violations and issue Phrasing Clearance PCC-1 if zero violations found.

**Anomaly Questions -- Status: OPEN**

| Anomaly Class | Question | Status |
|---------------|----------|--------|
| Trigger Storm | Does the statuscode change from In Progress to Resolved cause more triggers to fire than the environment's operational capacity can absorb? | OPEN |
| Missing Trigger | Is there an expected automation for this status transition that does not appear in the trigger surface? | OPEN |
| Circular Trigger | Does any trigger's output create a field write that re-activates the same or an upstream trigger? | OPEN |

**Denominator Pre-Scan:**

| Candidate Trigger | Flow Type | Activation Condition | Tier |
|------------------|-----------|---------------------|------|
| *[enumerate all candidates without filtering]* | | | |

Total candidate count N = *[integer -- declare before Phase 2 begins]*

**Exit condition:** Phase 1 SHALL be declared complete when: N is declared, all three anomaly question slots are explicitly marked OPEN, and PCC-1 is issued.

---

### Phase 2 -- Sync Trigger Enumeration

**Entry condition:** Phase 2 SHALL begin when: Phase 1 is complete, N is declared, and PCC-1 is issued. If PCC-1 is absent, Phase 2 SHALL NOT execute `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase 2 | FM-16]`.

**Job:** Phase 2 SHALL enumerate all synchronous triggers. Every sync-tier candidate from Phase 1 SHALL resolve to a FIRING ENTRY or NON-FIRING ENTRY. No candidate SHALL be omitted without a NON-FIRING ENTRY. At least one negative vocabulary example SHALL be included. [FM-11] Order by execution priority, highest first. [FM-02]

Sync trigger: executes within the same transaction (Dataverse sync plug-in step pre/post-operation; synchronous automated cloud flow on Dataverse change event).

**Negative vocabulary example (required):** `[VOCAB FAIL: "workflow" -> automated cloud flow | FM-08]`

**Sync Trigger Table:**

| # | Trigger Name | Flow Type | Execution Tier | Trigger Event | Input Fields | Output Action | Side Effects | Condition (Taken) | Condition (Skipped) | Anomaly Flag |
|---|-------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|

**Exit condition:** Phase 2 SHALL be declared complete when every sync-tier candidate has a resolved entry with all schema slots populated and no blank slots remain.

---

### Phase 3 -- Async Trigger Enumeration

**Entry condition:** Phase 3 SHALL begin when: Phase 2 is complete and the Sync Trigger Table is produced.

**Job:** Phase 3 SHALL enumerate all asynchronous triggers. Every async-tier candidate SHALL resolve to a FIRING ENTRY or NON-FIRING ENTRY. Order by connector tier, then by priority. [FM-02] Annotate latency tier (near-real-time / standard / batch) per entry. [FM-10]

Async trigger: executes outside the originating transaction (Dataverse async plug-in step; automated cloud flow with async trigger mode; Power Automate connector on Dataverse change events).

**Async Trigger Table:**

| # | Trigger Name | Flow Type | Execution Tier | Latency Tier | Trigger Event | Input Fields | Output Action | Side Effects | Condition (Taken) | Condition (Skipped) | Anomaly Flag |
|---|-------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|

**Exit condition:** Phase 3 SHALL be declared complete when every async-tier candidate has a resolved entry with all schema slots populated.

---

### Phase 4 -- Cascade Tracing

**Entry condition:** Phase 4 SHALL begin when: Phase 2 and Phase 3 are complete and both trigger tables are produced.

**Job:** Phase 4 SHALL trace every cascade chain originating from side-effect field writes to its terminal. Each chain SHALL receive a Chain ID. The final row of each chain SHALL be marked [TERMINAL]. [FM-20] Back-edge detection SHALL be applied to the adjacency structure to identify any cycles. [FM-19]

**Cascade Chain Table:**

| Chain ID | Step | Originating Trigger | Side-Effect Action | Field Mutated | Downstream Trigger | Chain-Status |
|----------|------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|

**Exit condition:** Phase 4 SHALL be declared complete when: all side-effect writes are evaluated, all chains carry Chain-Status, and back-edge detection has been applied.

---

### Phase 5 -- Anomaly Assessment

**Entry condition:** Phase 5 SHALL begin when: Phase 4 is complete and all cascade chains carry Chain-Status.

**Job:** Phase 5 SHALL deliver evidence-anchored verdicts for all three anomaly classes. Each verdict SHALL cite evidence from prior phases. Bare assertions SHALL be marked `[INSUFFICIENT: state evidence needed | FM-12]`. Every confirmed anomaly SHALL receive at least one remediation step. [FM-09]

**Trigger Storm:** Evidence: | Verdict: CONFIRMED / NOT DETECTED | Remediation (if confirmed):

**Missing Trigger:** Evidence: | Verdict: CONFIRMED / NOT DETECTED | Remediation (if confirmed):

**Circular Trigger:** Evidence: | Verdict: CONFIRMED / NOT DETECTED | Remediation (if confirmed):

**Exit condition:** Phase 5 SHALL be declared complete when: all three verdicts are issued with cited evidence and every confirmed anomaly has at least one remediation step.

---

### Phase 6 -- Trigger Map and Closure

**Entry condition:** Phase 6 SHALL begin when: Phase 5 is complete and all anomaly verdicts are issued.

**Job:** Phase 6 SHALL produce a trigger map with execution-tier and Spawns columns covering all triggers. Denominator closure SHALL be performed: firing + non-firing + unresolved = N.

**Trigger Map:**

| # | Trigger Name | Execution Tier | Anomaly Flag | Spawns |
|---|-------------|---------------|-------------|--------|

**Denominator Closure:** firing + non-firing + unresolved = N -> CLOSED / GAP DETECTED `[RECON MISS | FM-22]`

**Exit condition:** Phase 6 SHALL be declared complete when: trigger map covers all triggers with all required columns and denominator closure is stated with CLOSED or GAP DETECTED.

---

## V-03

**Variation axis:** Invariant 3 em-dash restatement scope "summary nature" only -- the em-dash restatement drops "or overview", using "the summary nature of an artifact does not confer exemption" instead of "the summary or overview nature of an artifact does not confer exemption"
**Hypothesis:** C-51 passes: Rule 1's jurisdictional scope limiter is present (phase-body gate statements excluded from DECLARATION authority). C-52 passes: Rule 3 names both FM-17 and FM-21 as the double violation. C-53 fails: Invariant 3's assertion clause already uses "summary function" (one term). The em-dash restatement is the self-sealing half that should carry the canonical two-term pair -- but it now uses "summary nature" only. An artifact labeled "overview", "digest", or "index" can argue Invariant 3's restatement covers only items explicitly classified as summaries, and that overview-type artifacts are a distinct class not covered by Invariant 3's prohibition. This reopens the same interpretive gap at the STRUCTURAL INVARIANT LAYER level that C-49 closed for Rule 1's sub-clause at the LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW level. The restatement's one-term form is structurally weaker than Rule 1's sub-clause (which does use "summary or overview"), creating an incoherence between the two prohibition layers.

You are a Power Automate / Copilot Studio trigger analysis engine.

A Dataverse `incident` record's `statuscode` field has changed from `In Progress` (2) to `Resolved` (5). Your task: determine exactly which automations fire, in what order, with what inputs and outputs, and identify all trigger pathologies (storms, missing triggers, circular triggers).

Execute the following phases in strict sequence. Each phase SHALL complete before the next begins. No phase SHALL execute until all prior phases have issued their required outputs.

---

### PROTOCOL PREAMBLE

*This block is the governing contract layer. It SHALL appear before Phase 1 and SHALL contain all three contract declarations: Platform Term Contract, FM Catalog, and Entry Schema Contract.*

#### Platform Term Contract

Approved vocabulary:

| Approved Term | Prohibited Substitutions |
|--------------|-------------------------|

| sync plug-in step | synchronous plugin, pre-stage plugin |
| async plug-in step | asynchronous plugin, background plugin |
| trigger event: When a row is added, modified or deleted | record trigger, update trigger |

| FM-25 | Missing trigger map | Trigger map with tier and cascade-link columns | `[MAP MISS \| FM-25]` | 6 |

*FM-21 is the self-referential entry: any violation marker appearing without an FM code is itself an FM-21 violation.*

---

**--- PHASE-BOUNDARY DEFECT CLASSES ---**

*Structural independence note: FM-16 (Entry Condition Absent) and FM-17 (Gate Register Drift) are structurally non-overlapping failure modes requiring separate FM IDs. The independence covers all three intersection cases:*

*FM-16 alone: A phase has no entry condition. Defect is presence, not quality. Register evaluation is not applicable -- no condition text exists to evaluate. Inline tag: `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase N | FM-16]`. FM-17 does NOT apply.*

*FM-17 alone: A phase has an entry condition stated descriptively rather than with formal obligation language. Presence satisfied; only register quality fails. Inline tag: `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: Phase N entry | FM-17]`. FM-16 does NOT apply.*

*Both simultaneously: A phase has no entry condition AND the document's register pattern indicates that a condition, if present, would also be stated descriptively. Both defects co-occur and are independently taggable: `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase N | FM-16]` AND `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: Phase N entry | FM-17]`. A single FM ID would conflate all three cases -- separate IDs make each tag independently informative.*

| FM Code | Defect | Description | Tag | Scope |
|---------|--------|-------------|-----|-------|
| FM-16 | Entry Condition Absent | A named phase carries no entry precondition | `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase N \| FM-16]` | All phases |
| FM-17 | Gate Register Drift | A gate statement uses descriptive language where SHALL/MUST is required | `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: Phase N gate \| FM-17]` | All phases |

---

#### Entry Schema Contract

All trigger entries SHALL conform to one of the following schemas. A slot left blank is a schema violation.

**FIRING ENTRY** (all slots required):

```
Trigger Name:
Flow Type:          [automated cloud flow | instant cloud flow | Dataverse plug-in | ...]
Execution Tier:     [sync | async | scheduled]
Trigger Event:
Input Fields:       [specific named fields -- no generic placeholders]
Output Action:      [specific action -- no generic placeholders]
Side Effects:       [field writes produced beyond primary output, or "none"]
Condition (Taken):  [what must be true for this trigger to fire]
Condition (Skipped):[what would cause this trigger NOT to fire in this scenario]
Anomaly Flag:       [none | storm | missing | circular]
```

**NON-FIRING ENTRY** (all slots required):

```
Trigger Name:
Flow Type:
Reason Not Firing:  [specific condition excluding this trigger]
Condition (Taken):  [what would cause this trigger to fire -- not met in this scenario]
Condition (Skipped):[what IS true in this scenario that blocks this trigger]
```

---

### STRUCTURAL INVARIANT LAYER

*Distinct from the PROTOCOL PREAMBLE. The PREAMBLE declares vocabulary, FM catalog, and schema contracts. This INVARIANT LAYER declares cross-phase structural obligations holding simultaneously across all phases and all gate-language artifact surfaces. Each invariant cites the FM catalog ID whose inline tag signals a violation.*

**Invariant 1 -- Phase body completeness:** Every phase body SHALL contain all three control artifacts: entry condition, job description, and exit condition. **Violation taggable as: `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase N | FM-16]`.**

**Invariant 2 -- Gate statement formal register (phase bodies):** All gate statements in phase bodies SHALL use formal obligation language (SHALL/MUST) in the obligation position. **Violation taggable as: `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: Phase N gate | FM-17]`.**

**Invariant 3 -- The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table gate-cell register:** The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table entry-condition and exit-condition cells are governed by this INVARIANT LAYER and SHALL satisfy the same formal-register obligation as phase-body gate statements (Invariant 2). The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table is NOT exempt from Invariant 2 by virtue of its summary function -- the summary nature of an artifact does not confer exemption from the formal-register obligation. A reader verifying Invariant 2 SHALL verify both phase-body gate statements AND The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table gate cells; partial compliance fails Invariant 2 even when the phase bodies themselves are conforming. **Violation taggable as: `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW Phase N entry/exit | FM-17]`.**

**Invariant 4 -- FM code in every violation marker:** Every inline violation marker SHALL include its FM catalog code. **Violation taggable as: `[FM-21]`.**

**Invariant 5 -- Denominator closure:** The candidate trigger count N declared in Phase 1 SHALL be reconciled after Phase 3: firing + non-firing + unresolved SHALL equal N. **Violation taggable as: `[RECON MISS | FM-22]`.**

---

### LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW

```
FORMAL-GATE ZONE DECLARATION -- THE LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW TABLE

Rule 1 (Governing authority): This DECLARATION governs all entry-condition and
exit-condition cells in The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table below. The STRUCTURAL
INVARIANT LAYER (Invariant 3) also governs these cells; this DECLARATION and
Invariant 3 are co-authoritative over The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table gate cells.
No artifact surface is exempt from this co-authority's formal-register
obligation, including any artifact whose nature is summary or overview -- the
summary or overview nature of an artifact does not confer exemption from the
formal-register obligation.
Phase-body gate statements are governed by their respective phase-body
specifications and by Invariant 2.

Rule 2 (Register requirement): All entry-condition and exit-condition cells in
this table SHALL use formal obligation language (SHALL/MUST) in the obligation
position. A cell stating a condition without an obligation verb is non-conforming
under this Rule and under Invariant 3.

Rule 3 (Self-tagging requirement): Any entry-condition or exit-condition cell
using descriptive state language SHALL be tagged [FM-17: Gate Register Drift]
inline within that cell. A non-conforming untagged cell is a double violation:
FM-17 for register drift and FM-21 for the missing FM code.

Rule 4 (Independent row verification): A reader verifying this table SHALL check
each gate cell independently against Rules 2 and 3. Row N conformance does not
imply Row N+1 conformance.
```

| Phase | Name | Entry Condition | Job Description | Exit Condition |
|-------|------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Pre-scan | Phase 1 SHALL begin when: input record change specification received and PROTOCOL PREAMBLE declared complete | Identify all candidate triggers without filtering; declare denominator N; open all three anomaly question slots OPEN; issue PCC-1 | Phase 1 SHALL be declared complete when: N is declared, all three anomaly slots are explicitly OPEN, and PCC-1 is issued |
| 2 | Sync Trigger Enumeration | Phase 2 SHALL begin when: Phase 1 complete, N declared, PCC-1 issued | Enumerate all sync-tier candidates using FIRING ENTRY or NON-FIRING ENTRY schema; include negative vocabulary example; order by priority | Phase 2 SHALL be declared complete when: all sync-tier candidates have resolved entries with all schema slots populated |

| 4 | Cascade Tracing | Phase 4 SHALL begin when: Phase 2 and Phase 3 complete and both trigger tables produced | Trace all cascade chains from side-effect field writes to terminal; assign chain IDs; apply back-edge detection | Phase 4 SHALL be declared complete when: all side-effect writes evaluated, all chains carry Chain-Status, back-edge detection applied |
| 5 | Anomaly Assessment | Phase 5 SHALL begin when: Phase 4 complete and all cascade chains carry Chain-Status | Deliver evidence-anchored verdicts for storm, missing trigger, circular trigger; propose remediation for each confirmed anomaly | Phase 5 SHALL be declared complete when: all three anomaly class verdicts issued with cited evidence and every confirmed anomaly has at least one remediation step |
| 6 | Trigger Map and Closure | Phase 6 SHALL begin when: Phase 5 complete and all anomaly verdicts issued | Produce trigger map with execution-tier and Spawns columns; perform denominator closure | Phase 6 SHALL be declared complete when: trigger map covers all triggers with required columns and denominator closure stated with CLOSED or GAP DETECTED |

---

### Phase 1 -- Pre-scan

**Entry condition:** Phase 1 SHALL begin when the input record change specification has been received and the PROTOCOL PREAMBLE has been declared complete.

**Job:** Phase 1 SHALL perform three operations before any trigger enumeration begins: (1) identify all candidate triggers without condition filtering and declare denominator N; (2) open all three anomaly question slots with explicit OPEN status; (3) scan this protocol for phrasing register violations and issue Phrasing Clearance PCC-1 if zero violations found.

**Anomaly Questions -- Status: OPEN**

| Trigger Storm | Does the statuscode change from In Progress to Resolved cause more triggers to fire than the environment's operational capacity can absorb? | OPEN |
| Missing Trigger | Is there an expected automation for this status transition that does not appear in the trigger surface? | OPEN |
| Circular Trigger | Does any trigger's output create a field write that re-activates the same or an upstream trigger? | OPEN |

**Denominator Pre-Scan:**

| Candidate Trigger | Flow Type | Activation Condition | Tier |
|------------------|-----------|---------------------|------|
| *[enumerate all candidates without filtering]* | | | |

Total candidate count N = *[integer -- declare before Phase 2 begins]*

**Exit condition:** Phase 1 SHALL be declared complete when: N is declared, all three anomaly question slots are explicitly marked OPEN, and PCC-1 is issued.

---

### Phase 2 -- Sync Trigger Enumeration

**Entry condition:** Phase 2 SHALL begin when: Phase 1 is complete, N is declared, and PCC-1 is issued. If PCC-1 is absent, Phase 2 SHALL NOT execute `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase 2 | FM-16]`.

**Job:** Phase 2 SHALL enumerate all synchronous triggers. Every sync-tier candidate from Phase 1 SHALL resolve to a FIRING ENTRY or NON-FIRING ENTRY. No candidate SHALL be omitted without a NON-FIRING ENTRY. At least one negative vocabulary example SHALL be included. [FM-11] Order by execution priority, highest first. [FM-02]

Sync trigger: executes within the same transaction (Dataverse sync plug-in step pre/post-operation; synchronous automated cloud flow on Dataverse change event).

**Negative vocabulary example (required):** `[VOCAB FAIL: "workflow" -> automated cloud flow | FM-08]`

**Sync Trigger Table:**

| # | Trigger Name | Flow Type | Execution Tier | Trigger Event | Input Fields | Output Action | Side Effects | Condition (Taken) | Condition (Skipped) | Anomaly Flag |
|---|-------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|

**Exit condition:** Phase 2 SHALL be declared complete when every sync-tier candidate has a resolved entry with all schema slots populated and no blank slots remain.

---

### Phase 3 -- Async Trigger Enumeration

**Entry condition:** Phase 3 SHALL begin when: Phase 2 is complete and the Sync Trigger Table is produced.

**Job:** Phase 3 SHALL enumerate all asynchronous triggers. Every async-tier candidate SHALL resolve to a FIRING ENTRY or NON-FIRING ENTRY. Order by connector tier, then by priority. [FM-02] Annotate latency tier (near-real-time / standard / batch) per entry. [FM-10]

Async trigger: executes outside the originating transaction (Dataverse async plug-in step; automated cloud flow with async trigger mode; Power Automate connector on Dataverse change events).

**Async Trigger Table:**

| # | Trigger Name | Flow Type | Execution Tier | Latency Tier | Trigger Event | Input Fields | Output Action | Side Effects | Condition (Taken) | Condition (Skipped) | Anomaly Flag |
|---|-------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|

**Exit condition:** Phase 3 SHALL be declared complete when every async-tier candidate has a resolved entry with all schema slots populated.

---

### Phase 4 -- Cascade Tracing

**Entry condition:** Phase 4 SHALL begin when: Phase 2 and Phase 3 are complete and both trigger tables are produced.

**Job:** Phase 4 SHALL trace every cascade chain originating from side-effect field writes to its terminal. Each chain SHALL receive a Chain ID. The final row of each chain SHALL be marked [TERMINAL]. [FM-20] Back-edge detection SHALL be applied to the adjacency structure to identify any cycles. [FM-19]

**Cascade Chain Table:**

| Chain ID | Step | Originating Trigger | Side-Effect Action | Field Mutated | Downstream Trigger | Chain-Status |
|----------|------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|

**Exit condition:** Phase 4 SHALL be declared complete when: all side-effect writes are evaluated, all chains carry Chain-Status, and back-edge detection has been applied.

---

### Phase 5 -- Anomaly Assessment

**Entry condition:** Phase 5 SHALL begin when: Phase 4 is complete and all cascade chains carry Chain-Status.

**Job:** Phase 5 SHALL deliver evidence-anchored verdicts for all three anomaly classes. Each verdict SHALL cite evidence from prior phases. Bare assertions SHALL be marked `[INSUFFICIENT: state evidence needed | FM-12]`. Every confirmed anomaly SHALL receive at least one remediation step. [FM-09]

**Trigger Storm:** Evidence: | Verdict: CONFIRMED / NOT DETECTED | Remediation (if confirmed):

**Missing Trigger:** Evidence: | Verdict: CONFIRMED / NOT DETECTED | Remediation (if confirmed):

**Circular Trigger:** Evidence: | Verdict: CONFIRMED / NOT DETECTED | Remediation (if confirmed):

**Exit condition:** Phase 5 SHALL be declared complete when: all three verdicts are issued with cited evidence and every confirmed anomaly has at least one remediation step.

---

### Phase 6 -- Trigger Map and Closure

**Entry condition:** Phase 6 SHALL begin when: Phase 5 is complete and all anomaly verdicts are issued.

**Job:** Phase 6 SHALL produce a trigger map with execution-tier and Spawns columns covering all triggers. Denominator closure SHALL be performed: firing + non-firing + unresolved = N.

**Trigger Map:**

| # | Trigger Name | Execution Tier | Anomaly Flag | Spawns |
|---|-------------|---------------|-------------|--------|

**Denominator Closure:** firing + non-firing + unresolved = N -> CLOSED / GAP DETECTED `[RECON MISS | FM-22]`

**Exit condition:** Phase 6 SHALL be declared complete when: trigger map covers all triggers with all required columns and denominator closure is stated with CLOSED or GAP DETECTED.

---

## V-04

**Variation axis:** Combined V-01 + V-02 -- Rule 1 jurisdictional scope limiter absent AND Rule 3 FM-21 absent; the two structural incompleteness defects co-occur independently
**Hypothesis:** C-53 passes: Invariant 3's em-dash restatement uses "summary or overview nature" (both terms present). C-51 fails: Rule 1 ends after the formal-register sub-clause with no sentence excluding phase-body gate statements from the DECLARATION's authority -- jurisdiction ambiguity present. C-52 fails: Rule 3 describes the non-conformance consequence as "a register drift violation tagged FM-17" without naming FM-21 -- double-violation incomplete. The two defects are independently detectable: a reader finds C-51's gap by scanning Rule 1 for jurisdiction boundary text and finds C-52's gap by scanning Rule 3's consequence statement for both FM codes. Neither defect implies the other. Combined, they make the FORMAL-GATE ZONE DECLARATION both jurisdictionally ambiguous and consequence-incomplete, producing two independent audit failures from a single reading of the DECLARATION.

You are a Power Automate / Copilot Studio trigger analysis engine.

A Dataverse `incident` record's `statuscode` field has changed from `In Progress` (2) to `Resolved` (5). Your task: determine exactly which automations fire, in what order, with what inputs and outputs, and identify all trigger pathologies (storms, missing triggers, circular triggers).

Execute the following phases in strict sequence. Each phase SHALL complete before the next begins. No phase SHALL execute until all prior phases have issued their required outputs.

---

### PROTOCOL PREAMBLE

*This block is the governing contract layer. It SHALL appear before Phase 1 and SHALL contain all three contract declarations: Platform Term Contract, FM Catalog, and Entry Schema Contract.*

#### Platform Term Contract

Approved vocabulary:

| Approved Term | Prohibited Substitutions |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| automated cloud flow | workflow, automation, rule |

| Dataverse plug-in | plugin, CRM plugin, platform plugin |
| sync plug-in step | synchronous plugin, pre-stage plugin |
| async plug-in step | asynchronous plugin, background plugin |
| trigger event: When a row is added, modified or deleted | record trigger, update trigger |
| Power Automate connector | connector trigger, flow connector |

Any term deviating from this list SHALL be tagged `[VOCAB FAIL: "actual text" -> correction | FM-08]`.

#### FM Catalog

| FM Code | Failure Mode | Expected Behavior | Output Marker | Phase(s) |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| FM-01 | Trigger omission | Every bound trigger listed by name | `[OMIT: trigger-name \| FM-01]` | 2, 3 |
| FM-02 | Firing order violation | Sync before async; by priority within tier | `[ORDER FAIL: actual \| FM-02]` | 2, 3 |
| FM-03 | Missing input/output specification | Named input payload and output action; no placeholders | `[IO FAIL: trigger-name \| FM-03]` | 2, 3 |

| FM-06 | Shallow side effect trace | Cascade traced until no further triggers fire | `[CASCADE SHALLOW \| FM-06]` | 4 |
| FM-07 | Missing conditional branch | Firing and skipped branch both stated | `[BRANCH MISS: trigger-name \| FM-07]` | 2, 3 |
| FM-08 | Wrong platform vocabulary | Approved vocabulary used throughout | `[VOCAB FAIL: "actual" -> correction \| FM-08]` | All |
| FM-09 | Missing risk ranking | Pathologies ranked with one-line mitigation | `[RISK MISS \| FM-09]` | 5 |
| FM-10 | Missing timing annotation | Sync/async distinguished; latency noted | `[TIMING MISS: trigger-name \| FM-10]` | 2, 3 |
| FM-11 | Missing negative example | At least one wrong-vs-correct vocabulary pair | `[NEG MISS \| FM-11]` | 2 |
| FM-12 | Ungrounded pathology verdict | Verdict cites evidence; bare assertions are insufficient | `[INSUFFICIENT: evidence needed \| FM-12]` | 5 |
| FM-13 | Open cascade chain | Termination condition declared per chain | `[CHAIN OPEN: CH-NN \| FM-13]` | 4 |
| FM-14 | No trigger graph | Adjacency list trigger->field->trigger constructed | `[GRAPH MISS \| FM-14]` | 5 |
| FM-15 | No denominator declaration | Count N declared before condition filtering | `[DENOM MISS \| FM-15]` | 1 |

| FM-20 | Missing terminal row marker | Each cascade chain closes with [TERMINAL] | `[CHAIN OPEN: CH-NN \| FM-20]` | 4 |
| FM-21 | FM code missing from violation cell | Every violation marker includes FM code | `[FM-21]` | All |
| FM-22 | No denominator reconciliation | Closure verifies firing + non-firing + unresolved = N | `[RECON MISS \| FM-22]` | 6 |
| FM-24 | No side-effect slot | Side-effect slot in every firing trigger entry | `[SE MISS: trigger-name \| FM-24]` | 2, 3 |
| FM-25 | Missing trigger map | Trigger map with tier and cascade-link columns | `[MAP MISS \| FM-25]` | 6 |

*FM-21 is the self-referential entry: any violation marker appearing without an FM code is itself an FM-21 violation.*

---

**--- PHASE-BOUNDARY DEFECT CLASSES ---**

*Structural independence note: FM-16 (Entry Condition Absent) and FM-17 (Gate Register Drift) are structurally non-overlapping failure modes requiring separate FM IDs. The independence covers all three intersection cases:*

*FM-16 alone: A phase has no entry condition. Defect is presence, not quality. Register evaluation is not applicable -- no condition text exists to evaluate. Inline tag: `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase N | FM-16]`. FM-17 does NOT apply.*

*FM-17 alone: A phase has an entry condition stated descriptively rather than with formal obligation language. Presence satisfied; only register quality fails. Inline tag: `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: Phase N entry | FM-17]`. FM-16 does NOT apply.*

*Both simultaneously: A phase has no entry condition AND the document's register pattern indicates that a condition, if present, would also be stated descriptively. Both defects co-occur and are independently taggable: `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase N | FM-16]` AND `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: Phase N entry | FM-17]`. A single FM ID would conflate all three cases -- separate IDs make each tag independently informative.*

| FM Code | Defect | Description | Tag | Scope |
|---------|--------|-------------|-----|-------|
| FM-16 | Entry Condition Absent | A named phase carries no entry precondition | `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase N \| FM-16]` | All phases |
| FM-17 | Gate Register Drift | A gate statement uses descriptive language where SHALL/MUST is required | `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: Phase N gate \| FM-17]` | All phases |

---

#### Entry Schema Contract

All trigger entries SHALL conform to one of the following schemas. A slot left blank is a schema violation.

**FIRING ENTRY** (all slots required):

```
Trigger Name:
Flow Type:          [automated cloud flow | instant cloud flow | Dataverse plug-in | ...]
Execution Tier:     [sync | async | scheduled]
Trigger Event:
Input Fields:       [specific named fields -- no generic placeholders]
Output Action:      [specific action -- no generic placeholders]
Side Effects:       [field writes produced beyond primary output, or "none"]
Condition (Taken):  [what must be true for this trigger to fire]
Condition (Skipped):[what would cause this trigger NOT to fire in this scenario]
Anomaly Flag:       [none | storm | missing | circular]
```

**NON-FIRING ENTRY** (all slots required):

```
Trigger Name:
Flow Type:
Reason Not Firing:  [specific condition excluding this trigger]
Condition (Taken):  [what would cause this trigger to fire -- not met in this scenario]
Condition (Skipped):[what IS true in this scenario that blocks this trigger]
```

---

### STRUCTURAL INVARIANT LAYER

*Distinct from the PROTOCOL PREAMBLE. The PREAMBLE declares vocabulary, FM catalog, and schema contracts. This INVARIANT LAYER declares cross-phase structural obligations holding simultaneously across all phases and all gate-language artifact surfaces. Each invariant cites the FM catalog ID whose inline tag signals a violation.*

**Invariant 1 -- Phase body completeness:** Every phase body SHALL contain all three control artifacts: entry condition, job description, and exit condition. **Violation taggable as: `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase N | FM-16]`.**

**Invariant 2 -- Gate statement formal register (phase bodies):** All gate statements in phase bodies SHALL use formal obligation language (SHALL/MUST) in the obligation position. **Violation taggable as: `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: Phase N gate | FM-17]`.**

**Invariant 3 -- The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table gate-cell register:** The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table entry-condition and exit-condition cells are governed by this INVARIANT LAYER and SHALL satisfy the same formal-register obligation as phase-body gate statements (Invariant 2). The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table is NOT exempt from Invariant 2 by virtue of its summary function -- the summary or overview nature of an artifact does not confer exemption from the formal-register obligation. A reader verifying Invariant 2 SHALL verify both phase-body gate statements AND The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table gate cells; partial compliance fails Invariant 2 even when the phase bodies themselves are conforming. **Violation taggable as: `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW Phase N entry/exit | FM-17]`.**

**Invariant 4 -- FM code in every violation marker:** Every inline violation marker SHALL include its FM catalog code. **Violation taggable as: `[FM-21]`.**

**Invariant 5 -- Denominator closure:** The candidate trigger count N declared in Phase 1 SHALL be reconciled after Phase 3: firing + non-firing + unresolved SHALL equal N. **Violation taggable as: `[RECON MISS | FM-22]`.**

---

### LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW

```
FORMAL-GATE ZONE DECLARATION -- THE LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW TABLE

Rule 1 (Governing authority): This DECLARATION governs all entry-condition and
exit-condition cells in The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table below. The STRUCTURAL
INVARIANT LAYER (Invariant 3) also governs these cells; this DECLARATION and
Invariant 3 are co-authoritative over The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table gate cells.
No artifact surface is exempt from this co-authority's formal-register
obligation, including any artifact whose nature is summary or overview -- the
summary or overview nature of an artifact does not confer exemption from the
formal-register obligation.

Rule 2 (Register requirement): All entry-condition and exit-condition cells in
this table SHALL use formal obligation language (SHALL/MUST) in the obligation
position. A cell stating a condition without an obligation verb is non-conforming
under this Rule and under Invariant 3.

Rule 3 (Self-tagging requirement): Any entry-condition or exit-condition cell
using descriptive state language SHALL be tagged [FM-17: Gate Register Drift]
inline within that cell. A non-conforming untagged cell carries a register drift
violation tagged [FM-17: Gate Register Drift]. The missing FM code is a separate
violation the reader must identify independently.

Rule 4 (Independent row verification): A reader verifying this table SHALL check
each gate cell independently against Rules 2 and 3. Row N conformance does not
imply Row N+1 conformance.
```

| Phase | Name | Entry Condition | Job Description | Exit Condition |
|-------|------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Pre-scan | Phase 1 SHALL begin when: input record change specification received and PROTOCOL PREAMBLE declared complete | Identify all candidate triggers without filtering; declare denominator N; open all three anomaly question slots OPEN; issue PCC-1 | Phase 1 SHALL be declared complete when: N is declared, all three anomaly slots are explicitly OPEN, and PCC-1 is issued |
| 2 | Sync Trigger Enumeration | Phase 2 SHALL begin when: Phase 1 complete, N declared, PCC-1 issued | Enumerate all sync-tier candidates using FIRING ENTRY or NON-FIRING ENTRY schema; include negative vocabulary example; order by priority | Phase 2 SHALL be declared complete when: all sync-tier candidates have resolved entries with all schema slots populated |
| 3 | Async Trigger Enumeration | Phase 3 SHALL begin when: Phase 2 complete and Sync Trigger Table produced | Enumerate all async-tier candidates using schema; annotate latency tier per entry | Phase 3 SHALL be declared complete when: all async-tier candidates have resolved entries with all schema slots populated |
| 4 | Cascade Tracing | Phase 4 SHALL begin when: Phase 2 and Phase 3 complete and both trigger tables produced | Trace all cascade chains from side-effect field writes to terminal; assign chain IDs; apply back-edge detection | Phase 4 SHALL be declared complete when: all side-effect writes evaluated, all chains carry Chain-Status, back-edge detection applied |
| 5 | Anomaly Assessment | Phase 5 SHALL begin when: Phase 4 complete and all cascade chains carry Chain-Status | Deliver evidence-anchored verdicts for storm, missing trigger, circular trigger; propose remediation for each confirmed anomaly | Phase 5 SHALL be declared complete when: all three anomaly class verdicts issued with cited evidence and every confirmed anomaly has at least one remediation step |
| 6 | Trigger Map and Closure | Phase 6 SHALL begin when: Phase 5 complete and all anomaly verdicts issued | Produce trigger map with execution-tier and Spawns columns; perform denominator closure | Phase 6 SHALL be declared complete when: trigger map covers all triggers with required columns and denominator closure stated with CLOSED or GAP DETECTED |

---

### Phase 1 -- Pre-scan

**Entry condition:** Phase 1 SHALL begin when the input record change specification has been received and the PROTOCOL PREAMBLE has been declared complete.

**Job:** Phase 1 SHALL perform three operations before any trigger enumeration begins: (1) identify all candidate triggers without condition filtering and declare denominator N; (2) open all three anomaly question slots with explicit OPEN status; (3) scan this protocol for phrasing register violations and issue Phrasing Clearance PCC-1 if zero violations found.

**Anomaly Questions -- Status: OPEN**

| Anomaly Class | Question | Status |
|---------------|----------|--------|
| Trigger Storm | Does the statuscode change from In Progress to Resolved cause more triggers to fire than the environment's operational capacity can absorb? | OPEN |
| Missing Trigger | Is there an expected automation for this status transition that does not appear in the trigger surface? | OPEN |
| Circular Trigger | Does any trigger's output create a field write that re-activates the same or an upstream trigger? | OPEN |

**Denominator Pre-Scan:**

| Candidate Trigger | Flow Type | Activation Condition | Tier |
|------------------|-----------|---------------------|------|
| *[enumerate all candidates without filtering]* | | | |

Total candidate count N = *[integer -- declare before Phase 2 begins]*

**Exit condition:** Phase 1 SHALL be declared complete when: N is declared, all three anomaly question slots are explicitly marked OPEN, and PCC-1 is issued.

---

### Phase 2 -- Sync Trigger Enumeration

**Entry condition:** Phase 2 SHALL begin when: Phase 1 is complete, N is declared, and PCC-1 is issued. If PCC-1 is absent, Phase 2 SHALL NOT execute `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase 2 | FM-16]`.

**Job:** Phase 2 SHALL enumerate all synchronous triggers. Every sync-tier candidate from Phase 1 SHALL resolve to a FIRING ENTRY or NON-FIRING ENTRY. No candidate SHALL be omitted without a NON-FIRING ENTRY. At least one negative vocabulary example SHALL be included. [FM-11] Order by execution priority, highest first. [FM-02]

Sync trigger: executes within the same transaction (Dataverse sync plug-in step pre/post-operation; synchronous automated cloud flow on Dataverse change event).

**Negative vocabulary example (required):** `[VOCAB FAIL: "workflow" -> automated cloud flow | FM-08]`

**Sync Trigger Table:**

| # | Trigger Name | Flow Type | Execution Tier | Trigger Event | Input Fields | Output Action | Side Effects | Condition (Taken) | Condition (Skipped) | Anomaly Flag |
|---|-------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|

**Exit condition:** Phase 2 SHALL be declared complete when every sync-tier candidate has a resolved entry with all schema slots populated and no blank slots remain.

---

### Phase 3 -- Async Trigger Enumeration

**Entry condition:** Phase 3 SHALL begin when: Phase 2 is complete and the Sync Trigger Table is produced.

**Job:** Phase 3 SHALL enumerate all asynchronous triggers. Every async-tier candidate SHALL resolve to a FIRING ENTRY or NON-FIRING ENTRY. Order by connector tier, then by priority. [FM-02] Annotate latency tier (near-real-time / standard / batch) per entry. [FM-10]

Async trigger: executes outside the originating transaction (Dataverse async plug-in step; automated cloud flow with async trigger mode; Power Automate connector on Dataverse change events).

**Async Trigger Table:**

| # | Trigger Name | Flow Type | Execution Tier | Latency Tier | Trigger Event | Input Fields | Output Action | Side Effects | Condition (Taken) | Condition (Skipped) | Anomaly Flag |
|---|-------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|

**Exit condition:** Phase 3 SHALL be declared complete when every async-tier candidate has a resolved entry with all schema slots populated.

---

### Phase 4 -- Cascade Tracing

**Entry condition:** Phase 4 SHALL begin when: Phase 2 and Phase 3 are complete and both trigger tables are produced.

**Job:** Phase 4 SHALL trace every cascade chain originating from side-effect field writes to its terminal. Each chain SHALL receive a Chain ID. The final row of each chain SHALL be marked [TERMINAL]. [FM-20] Back-edge detection SHALL be applied to the adjacency structure to identify any cycles. [FM-19]

**Cascade Chain Table:**

| Chain ID | Step | Originating Trigger | Side-Effect Action | Field Mutated | Downstream Trigger | Chain-Status |
|----------|------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|

**Exit condition:** Phase 4 SHALL be declared complete when: all side-effect writes are evaluated, all chains carry Chain-Status, and back-edge detection has been applied.

---

### Phase 5 -- Anomaly Assessment

**Entry condition:** Phase 5 SHALL begin when: Phase 4 is complete and all cascade chains carry Chain-Status.

**Job:** Phase 5 SHALL deliver evidence-anchored verdicts for all three anomaly classes. Each verdict SHALL cite evidence from prior phases. Bare assertions SHALL be marked `[INSUFFICIENT: state evidence needed | FM-12]`. Every confirmed anomaly SHALL receive at least one remediation step. [FM-09]

**Trigger Storm:** Evidence: | Verdict: CONFIRMED / NOT DETECTED | Remediation (if confirmed):

**Missing Trigger:** Evidence: | Verdict: CONFIRMED / NOT DETECTED | Remediation (if confirmed):

**Circular Trigger:** Evidence: | Verdict: CONFIRMED / NOT DETECTED | Remediation (if confirmed):

**Exit condition:** Phase 5 SHALL be declared complete when: all three verdicts are issued with cited evidence and every confirmed anomaly has at least one remediation step.

---

### Phase 6 -- Trigger Map and Closure

**Entry condition:** Phase 6 SHALL begin when: Phase 5 is complete and all anomaly verdicts are issued.

**Job:** Phase 6 SHALL produce a trigger map with execution-tier and Spawns columns covering all triggers. Denominator closure SHALL be performed: firing + non-firing + unresolved = N.

**Trigger Map:**

| # | Trigger Name | Execution Tier | Anomaly Flag | Spawns |
|---|-------------|---------------|-------------|--------|

**Denominator Closure:** firing + non-firing + unresolved = N -> CLOSED / GAP DETECTED `[RECON MISS | FM-22]`

**Exit condition:** Phase 6 SHALL be declared complete when: trigger map covers all triggers with all required columns and denominator closure is stated with CLOSED or GAP DETECTED.

---

## V-05

**Variation axis:** Full combination -- Rule 1 jurisdictional scope limiter present, Rule 3 names both FM-17 and FM-21 as a double violation, Invariant 3 em-dash restatement uses "summary or overview nature" (canonical two-term pair)
**Hypothesis:** All three structural properties present. C-51 passes: Rule 1's final sentence explicitly excludes phase-body gate statements from the DECLARATION's authority and names Invariant 2 and phase-body specifications as their governing authority -- the DECLARATION and STRUCTURAL INVARIANT LAYER are non-overlapping governance authorities with distinct subjects. C-52 passes: Rule 3 declares the non-conformance consequence as "a double violation: FM-17 for register drift and FM-21 for the missing FM code" -- both FM codes cited by number, the mechanism self-contained. C-53 passes: Invariant 3's em-dash restatement says "the summary or overview nature of an artifact does not confer exemption" -- both "summary" and "overview" present in the self-sealing half. The three properties together make the FORMAL-GATE ZONE DECLARATION and STRUCTURAL INVARIANT LAYER jointly self-sealing: jurisdictionally bounded (C-51), consequence-complete (C-52), and scope-consistent across both prohibition layers (C-53).

| FM-25 | Missing trigger map | Trigger map with tier and cascade-link columns | `[MAP MISS \| FM-25]` | 6 |

*FM-21 is the self-referential entry: any violation marker appearing without an FM code is itself an FM-21 violation.*

---

**--- PHASE-BOUNDARY DEFECT CLASSES ---**

*Structural independence note: FM-16 (Entry Condition Absent) and FM-17 (Gate Register Drift) are structurally non-overlapping failure modes requiring separate FM IDs. The independence covers all three intersection cases:*

*FM-16 alone: A phase has no entry condition. Defect is presence, not quality. Register evaluation is not applicable -- no condition text exists to evaluate. Inline tag: `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase N | FM-16]`. FM-17 does NOT apply.*

*FM-17 alone: A phase has an entry condition stated descriptively rather than with formal obligation language. Presence satisfied; only register quality fails. Inline tag: `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: Phase N entry | FM-17]`. FM-16 does NOT apply.*

*Both simultaneously: A phase has no entry condition AND the document's register pattern indicates that a condition, if present, would also be stated descriptively. Both defects co-occur and are independently taggable: `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase N | FM-16]` AND `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: Phase N entry | FM-17]`. A single FM ID would conflate all three cases -- separate IDs make each tag independently informative.*

| FM Code | Defect | Description | Tag | Scope |
|---------|--------|-------------|-----|-------|
| FM-16 | Entry Condition Absent | A named phase carries no entry precondition | `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase N \| FM-16]` | All phases |
| FM-17 | Gate Register Drift | A gate statement uses descriptive language where SHALL/MUST is required | `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: Phase N gate \| FM-17]` | All phases |

#### Entry Schema Contract

All trigger entries SHALL conform to one of the following schemas. A slot left blank is a schema violation.

**FIRING ENTRY** (all slots required):

```
Trigger Name:
Flow Type:          [automated cloud flow | instant cloud flow | Dataverse plug-in | ...]
Execution Tier:     [sync | async | scheduled]
Trigger Event:
Input Fields:       [specific named fields -- no generic placeholders]
Output Action:      [specific action -- no generic placeholders]
Side Effects:       [field writes produced beyond primary output, or "none"]
Condition (Taken):  [what must be true for this trigger to fire]
Condition (Skipped):[what would cause this trigger NOT to fire in this scenario]
Anomaly Flag:       [none | storm | missing | circular]
```

**NON-FIRING ENTRY** (all slots required):

```
Trigger Name:
Flow Type:
Reason Not Firing:  [specific condition excluding this trigger]
Condition (Taken):  [what would cause this trigger to fire -- not met in this scenario]
Condition (Skipped):[what IS true in this scenario that blocks this trigger]
```

### STRUCTURAL INVARIANT LAYER

*Distinct from the PROTOCOL PREAMBLE. The PREAMBLE declares vocabulary, FM catalog, and schema contracts. This INVARIANT LAYER declares cross-phase structural obligations holding simultaneously across all phases and all gate-language artifact surfaces. Each invariant cites the FM catalog ID whose inline tag signals a violation.*

**Invariant 1 -- Phase body completeness:** Every phase body SHALL contain all three control artifacts: entry condition, job description, and exit condition. **Violation taggable as: `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase N | FM-16]`.**

**Invariant 2 -- Gate statement formal register (phase bodies):** All gate statements in phase bodies SHALL use formal obligation language (SHALL/MUST) in the obligation position. **Violation taggable as: `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: Phase N gate | FM-17]`.**

**Invariant 3 -- The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table gate-cell register:** The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table entry-condition and exit-condition cells are governed by this INVARIANT LAYER and SHALL satisfy the same formal-register obligation as phase-body gate statements (Invariant 2). The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table is NOT exempt from Invariant 2 by virtue of its summary function -- the summary or overview nature of an artifact does not confer exemption from the formal-register obligation. A reader verifying Invariant 2 SHALL verify both phase-body gate statements AND The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table gate cells; partial compliance fails Invariant 2 even when the phase bodies themselves are conforming. **Violation taggable as: `[GATE REGISTER DRIFT: LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW Phase N entry/exit | FM-17]`.**

**Invariant 4 -- FM code in every violation marker:** Every inline violation marker SHALL include its FM catalog code. **Violation taggable as: `[FM-21]`.**

**Invariant 5 -- Denominator closure:** The candidate trigger count N declared in Phase 1 SHALL be reconciled after Phase 3: firing + non-firing + unresolved SHALL equal N. **Violation taggable as: `[RECON MISS | FM-22]`.**

---

### LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW

```
FORMAL-GATE ZONE DECLARATION -- THE LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW TABLE

Rule 1 (Governing authority): This DECLARATION governs all entry-condition and
exit-condition cells in The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table below. The STRUCTURAL
INVARIANT LAYER (Invariant 3) also governs these cells; this DECLARATION and
Invariant 3 are co-authoritative over The LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW table gate cells.
No artifact surface is exempt from this co-authority's formal-register
obligation, including any artifact whose nature is summary or overview -- the
summary or overview nature of an artifact does not confer exemption from the
formal-register obligation.
Phase-body gate statements are governed by their respective phase-body
specifications and by Invariant 2.

Rule 2 (Register requirement): All entry-condition and exit-condition cells in
this table SHALL use formal obligation language (SHALL/MUST) in the obligation
position. A cell stating a condition without an obligation verb is non-conforming
under this Rule and under Invariant 3.

Rule 3 (Self-tagging requirement): Any entry-condition or exit-condition cell
using descriptive state language SHALL be tagged [FM-17: Gate Register Drift]
inline within that cell. A non-conforming untagged cell is a double violation:
FM-17 for register drift and FM-21 for the missing FM code.

Rule 4 (Independent row verification): A reader verifying this table SHALL check
each gate cell independently against Rules 2 and 3. Row N conformance does not
imply Row N+1 conformance.

---

### Phase 1 -- Pre-scan

**Entry condition:** Phase 1 SHALL begin when the input record change specification has been received and the PROTOCOL PREAMBLE has been declared complete.

**Job:** Phase 1 SHALL perform three operations before any trigger enumeration begins: (1) identify all candidate triggers without condition filtering and declare denominator N; (2) open all three anomaly question slots with explicit OPEN status; (3) scan this protocol for phrasing register violations and issue Phrasing Clearance PCC-1 if zero violations found.

**Anomaly Questions -- Status: OPEN**

| Anomaly Class | Question | Status |
|---------------|----------|--------|
| Trigger Storm | Does the statuscode change from In Progress to Resolved cause more triggers to fire than the environment's operational capacity can absorb? | OPEN |
| Missing Trigger | Is there an expected automation for this status transition that does not appear in the trigger surface? | OPEN |
| Circular Trigger | Does any trigger's output create a field write that re-activates the same or an upstream trigger? | OPEN |

**Denominator Pre-Scan:**

| Candidate Trigger | Flow Type | Activation Condition | Tier |
|------------------|-----------|---------------------|------|
| *[enumerate all candidates without filtering]* | | | |

Total candidate count N = *[integer -- declare before Phase 2 begins]*

**Exit condition:** Phase 1 SHALL be declared complete when: N is declared, all three anomaly question slots are explicitly marked OPEN, and PCC-1 is issued.

---

### Phase 2 -- Sync Trigger Enumeration

**Entry condition:** Phase 2 SHALL begin when: Phase 1 is complete, N is declared, and PCC-1 is issued. If PCC-1 is absent, Phase 2 SHALL NOT execute `[ENTRY CONDITION ABSENT: Phase 2 | FM-16]`.

**Job:** Phase 2 SHALL enumerate all synchronous triggers. Every sync-tier candidate from Phase 1 SHALL resolve to a FIRING ENTRY or NON-FIRING ENTRY. No candidate SHALL be omitted without a NON-FIRING ENTRY. At least one negative vocabulary example SHALL be included. [FM-11] Order by execution priority, highest first. [FM-02]

Sync trigger: executes within the same transaction (Dataverse sync plug-in step pre/post-operation; synchronous automated cloud flow on Dataverse change event).

**Negative vocabulary example (required):** `[VOCAB FAIL: "workflow" -> automated cloud flow | FM-08]`

**Sync Trigger Table:**

| # | Trigger Name | Flow Type | Execution Tier | Trigger Event | Input Fields | Output Action | Side Effects | Condition (Taken) | Condition (Skipped) | Anomaly Flag |
|---|-------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|

**Exit condition:** Phase 2 SHALL be declared complete when every sync-tier candidate has a resolved entry with all schema slots populated and no blank slots remain.

---

### Phase 3 -- Async Trigger Enumeration

**Entry condition:** Phase 3 SHALL begin when: Phase 2 is complete and the Sync Trigger Table is produced.

**Job:** Phase 3 SHALL enumerate all asynchronous triggers. Every async-tier candidate SHALL resolve to a FIRING ENTRY or NON-FIRING ENTRY. Order by connector tier, then by priority. [FM-02] Annotate latency tier (near-real-time / standard / batch) per entry. [FM-10]

Async trigger: executes outside the originating transaction (Dataverse async plug-in step; automated cloud flow with async trigger mode; Power Automate connector on Dataverse change events).

**Async Trigger Table:**

| # | Trigger Name | Flow Type | Execution Tier | Latency Tier | Trigger Event | Input Fields | Output Action | Side Effects | Condition (Taken) | Condition (Skipped) | Anomaly Flag |
|---|-------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|

**Exit condition:** Phase 3 SHALL be declared complete when every async-tier candidate has a resolved entry with all schema slots populated.

---

### Phase 4 -- Cascade Tracing

**Entry condition:** Phase 4 SHALL begin when: Phase 2 and Phase 3 are complete and both trigger tables are produced.

**Job:** Phase 4 SHALL trace every cascade chain originating from side-effect field writes to its terminal. Each chain SHALL receive a Chain ID. The final row of each chain SHALL be marked [TERMINAL]. [FM-20] Back-edge detection SHALL be applied to the adjacency structure to identify any cycles. [FM-19]

**Cascade Chain Table:**

| Chain ID | Step | Originating Trigger | Side-Effect Action | Field Mutated | Downstream Trigger | Chain-Status |
|----------|------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|

**Exit condition:** Phase 4 SHALL be declared complete when: all side-effect writes are evaluated, all chains carry Chain-Status, and back-edge detection has been applied.

---

### Phase 5 -- Anomaly Assessment

**Entry condition:** Phase 5 SHALL begin when: Phase 4 is complete and all cascade chains carry Chain-Status.

**Job:** Phase 5 SHALL deliver evidence-anchored verdicts for all three anomaly classes. Each verdict SHALL cite evidence from prior phases. Bare assertions SHALL be marked `[INSUFFICIENT: state evidence needed | FM-12]`. Every confirmed anomaly SHALL receive at least one remediation step. [FM-09]

**Trigger Storm:** Evidence: | Verdict: CONFIRMED / NOT DETECTED | Remediation (if confirmed):

**Missing Trigger:** Evidence: | Verdict: CONFIRMED / NOT DETECTED | Remediation (if confirmed):

**Circular Trigger:** Evidence: | Verdict: CONFIRMED / NOT DETECTED | Remediation (if confirmed):

**Exit condition:** Phase 5 SHALL be declared complete when: all three verdicts are issued with cited evidence and every confirmed anomaly has at least one remediation step.

---

### Phase 6 -- Trigger Map and Closure

**Entry condition:** Phase 6 SHALL begin when: Phase 5 is complete and all anomaly verdicts are issued.

**Job:** Phase 6 SHALL produce a trigger map with execution-tier and Spawns columns covering all triggers. Denominator closure SHALL be performed: firing + non-firing + unresolved = N.

**Trigger Map:**

| # | Trigger Name | Execution Tier | Anomaly Flag | Spawns |
|---|-------------|---------------|-------------|--------|

**Denominator Closure:** firing + non-firing + unresolved = N -> CLOSED / GAP DETECTED `[RECON MISS | FM-22]`

**Exit condition:** Phase 6 SHALL be declared complete when: trigger map covers all triggers with all required columns and denominator closure is stated with CLOSED or GAP DETECTED.
