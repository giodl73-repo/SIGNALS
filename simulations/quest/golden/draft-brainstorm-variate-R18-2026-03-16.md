# Variate R18 -- draft-brainstorm

5 complete prompt body variations for the `draft-brainstorm` skill.
Single-axis variations first (V-01, V-02, V-03), then combinations (V-04, V-05).

R18 extends the session-envelope lifecycle signals established in R17. R17 placed both
signals (session-open before Pre-Phase and session-close after Phase 3); R18 targets the
**content** of those signals -- whether they carry phase-specific information or remain
generic markers.

| Phase/Level | Close signal | Open signal (double-mark) | Criteria |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------------|---------|
| Phase 0 | C-37 | C-38 | R13 |
| Pre-Phase | C-39 | C-40 | R14 |
| Phase 1 | C-41 | C-42 | R15 |
| Phase 2 | C-43 | C-44 | R16 (current max) |
| Phase 3 | C-45 | C-46 | hypothetical v17 |
| Session | C-47 | C-48 | hypothetical v18 |
| Session content | C-50 | C-49 | **R18 targets** (hypothetical v19) |

R17 V-02 backbone is the starting point for all R18 variations. It carries every
lifecycle signal through the session level (C-43/C-44 verified under v16; C-45..C-48
as hypothetical forward-earners).

**C-49 candidate** -- Session-Open Phase Roster: The session-open blockquote names the
five phases in sequence, not just the topic and "no preconditions". Example form:
`> **Brainstorm session opens.** Topic: {{topic}}. Phases: Pre-Phase → Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3. No preconditions.`

**C-50 candidate** -- Session-Close Completeness Ledger: The session-close blockquote
explicitly names each phase that closed, not just a generic "all five phases executed".
Example form: `> **Session complete.** Phases closed: Pre-Phase (lenses), Phase 0 (inertia baseline), Phase 1 (pool), Phase 2 (peer-comparison), Phase 3 (finalized). Artifact written and closed.`

**Interference check**: C-49 (session-open roster) and C-48 (session double-mark) operate
on the same signal at the same position -- but C-48 is a structural presence test (is the
opening blockquote present?) while C-49 is a content test (does the opening blockquote
name the phase sequence?). Earning C-48 and C-49 simultaneously is valid: the opening
blockquote earns C-48 for existing; it earns C-49 additionally if it names the phases.
Same logic applies to C-47/C-50 on the session-close signal.

**R18 baseline**: V-03 is the exact V-02 R17 backbone, reproduced without modification.
It carries session-open and session-close (C-47/C-48 as hypothetical v18 earners) but
with generic content -- confirming that the V-02 R17 ceiling is reproducible entering R18
and that the delta between V-03 and V-01/V-02/V-04/V-05 under hypothetical v19 is
attributable solely to phase-named content in the session signals.

---

## Variation Axes

| Axis | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Session-open phase roster | Whether session-open names the 5 phases in sequence (C-49 candidate) |
| Session-close phase ledger | Whether session-close names each completed phase explicitly (C-50 candidate) |
| Phase roster notation | Arrow-sequence (Pre-Phase → Phase 0 → ...) vs. numbered enumeration |
| Session-close content depth | Phase names only vs. phase names + specific output achieved |
| Baseline contrast | V-02 R17 exact -- session open/close present, no phase roster or ledger |

## Single-axis variations

---

### V-01 -- Session-Open Phase Roster (C-49 floor candidate)

**Axis**: Session-open content enrichment (arrow-sequence notation)
**Hypothesis**: The R17 backbone session-open reads `> **Brainstorm session opens.** Topic:
{{topic}}. No preconditions.` -- it confirms session start and names the topic, but does
not name the phases. V-01 adds the phase sequence in arrow notation to the session-open
tag, making it an explicit agenda at the outermost level. The session-close tag is
unchanged from R17 backbone (generic "all five phases executed"). C-50 FAIL. Everything
else is the V-02 R17 backbone (all phase-level lifecycle signals, registry, prohibitions,
C-43/C-44 Phase 2 double-mark, Phase 3 double-mark, all C-01..C-48 as inherited).

**Expected**: C-01..C-48 (inh from V-02 R17 backbone, unrewarded under v16) + C-49 PASS
(session-open names phase sequence in arrow notation) + C-50 FAIL (session-close generic)
= **185** under v16. Under hypothetical v19: **197.5** (C-49 PASS +2.5, C-50 FAIL).

```
You are running the `draft-brainstorm` skill for the topic: {{topic}}

This skill runs in five phases: Pre-Phase (lenses), Phase 0 (inertia baseline),
Phase 1 (pool), Phase 2 (peer-comparison), Phase 3 (finalize). Complete each in order.
Do not advance to the next phase until the current phase is complete.

> **Brainstorm session opens.** Topic: {{topic}}. Phases: Pre-Phase → Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3. No preconditions.

---

## Pre-Phase -- Generative Lenses

*Pre-Phase opens now. No preconditions.*

Before writing a single idea or establishing the inertia baseline, define 3 directions
that will actively pull the pool away from its center of gravity. These are production
constraints -- they determine which ideas appear in Phase 1, not which ideas survive
a post-hoc filter.

For each lens:
- **Lens name**: one phrase (e.g., "More Ambitious", "Audience Shift", "Incremental")
- **Direction**: one sentence describing the shift axis
- **Pool impact**: what kinds of ideas appear under this lens that would not appear in a
  default brainstorm? Name candidate types, not framing differences.
- **Re-run test**: if a reader took only this lens and re-ran the brainstorm, would the
  resulting pool contain ideas not in the current pool? Different candidates, not the same
  candidates under different labels. If not, sharpen the lens before proceeding.

Write all 3 lenses. Do not begin Phase 0 until all 3 lenses pass the re-run test.

> **Pre-Phase complete.** All 3 lenses pass the re-run test. Phase 0 opens now.

---

## Phase 0 -- Inertia Baseline

> **Phase 0 opens now. No preconditions.**

Before generating any candidate ideas, fully specify the Do Nothing option for {{topic}}.
This is the most important entry in the pool: it is already in play, and every other
candidate exists to displace it.

Write the following four fields:

**Current Trajectory**: What is happening to {{topic}} right now with no deliberate
intervention? Name the specific direction the system, team, or product is already moving.
(2-3 sentences.)

**Accumulated Cost**: What concretely accumulates -- technically, organizationally, or for
users -- if this trajectory continues for 12 months? Be specific: what is delayed,
degraded, or foreclosed? (2-3 sentences.)

**Displacement Target**: What must a competing idea change about the trajectory to beat
this baseline? State the minimum threshold: "A candidate beats Do Nothing if and only if
it [specific condition]." (1 sentence.)

**Do Nothing** (pool entry):
```
**Pitch**: [One sentence summarizing the status quo trajectory from the analysis above]
**Rationale**: [The Accumulated Cost, compressed to one sentence]
```

> **Phase 0 complete.** All four fields written. Do Nothing established. Phase 1 opens
> below.

---

## Phase 1 -- Idea Pool

*Phase 1 requires: Phase 0 complete (all four fields + Do Nothing entry written).*

> **Phase 1 opens now.** Phase 0 complete. Do Nothing established.

### 1a. Inertia Frame

Write a paragraph (3-5 sentences) expanding on the Phase 0 baseline for a general reader:
What is the current trajectory for {{topic}}? What does the team inherit if no deliberate
decision is made? What does the path of least resistance produce -- technically,
organizationally, or for users?

This paragraph must appear as the first element in the final artifact, before any ideas.

### 1b. Idea Pool

Using the 3 Pre-Phase lenses as active generation constraints, produce **19-39 additional
candidates** for {{topic}} -- for a total of 20-40 ideas including the Phase 0 Do Nothing
entry. Your output must contain one labeled section per required dimension. Each is a
**mandatory `##` section** -- do not collapse into a flat list, do not omit any. You may
add sections beyond the six required.

**Required dimensions (each must appear as a `##` section):**
- **Scope** -- how much of {{topic}}'s problem space is addressed
- **Timing** -- when the intervention lands in the product lifecycle
- **Integration** -- how it connects to existing systems or teams
- **Audience** -- who benefits most
- **Build vs. Buy** -- internal build, external adoption, or extension of existing
- **Status Quo** -- contains exactly the Do Nothing entry from Phase 0

**Lens attribution**: Tag at least 2 ideas per lens inline (e.g., `[Lens: Audience Shift]`).
Aim for at least 6 lens-attributed ideas total. Center-of-gravity ideas are permitted but
must not dominate the pool.

**Do not mark top-5 yet.** Generate the complete pool before selecting. Do not place any
`**` markers on any idea during Phase 1. Marking as you write introduces sequential bias --
finish the pool first.

For each idea (other than Do Nothing):
```
### [Idea Name]

**Pitch**: One sentence.
**Rationale**: Why this serves {{topic}} specifically -- cite a real constraint, user need,
or opportunity. Include one sentence naming how this idea changes the Phase 0 trajectory:
what specifically does it displace or prevent?
```

### 1c. AMEND Draft

Write a draft AMEND section with 3 pool-shift directions. For each:
- Name the shift axis
- Describe what kinds of ideas would appear or disappear
- Apply the distribution-shift test: re-running with only this directive must produce
  candidate ideas not in the current pool. Different candidates, not the same candidates
  under different framing. A direction that shifts only emphasis or category labels without
  introducing different underlying candidates fails this test.

Do not finalize AMEND yet -- it will be verified in Phase 2 Check C.

> **Phase 1 complete.** The full pool (19-39 net-new ideas + Do Nothing = 20-40 total) is
> written. AMEND draft written. No `**` marks in output. Phase 2 may begin.

---

## Phase 2 -- Peer-Comparison

*Phase 2 requires: Phase 1 complete ("Phase 1 complete." signal written above).*

> **Phase 2 opens now.** Phase 1 complete. Full pool written, AMEND drafted.

**Check A -- Sequential Default**
Identify 5 top-5 candidates. Are they the first 5 ideas generated? If yes, rescan the
full pool -- the strongest ideas surface across the whole run, not only at the start.
Output of Check A: 5 candidates advancing to the Registry.

**Check B -- Peer-Comparison Registry**

For each of the 5 candidates, write one row. Do not fill in Selected? during construction.

| # | Candidate (exact name from pool) | Peer (exact name, same ## section, unmarked) | I chose [Candidate] over [Peer] because ___ | Selected? |
|---|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

Write all five "I chose ... because ___" sentences before evaluating any of them.
Do not assess whether a row passes while other rows remain blank.

**Column rules:**
- **Candidate**: exact idea name from Phase 1b; one of the 5 from Check A
- **Peer**: exact name of one specific unmarked idea in the same `##` section; cannot
  be blank
- **"I chose ... because ___"**: complete the sentence with a specific reason tied to
  {{topic}}'s actual constraints (scope, user group, cost, risk); "it is better" or
  "more viable" do not count
- **Selected?**: Phase-advance gate. This column cannot hold any value, and Phase 3
  cannot begin, until both preconditions hold simultaneously: (a) all 5 rows of this
  Registry are written in your output, AND (b) Selected? is blank across all 5 rows.
  A partial Registry has no valid Selected? entries. A Registry where any Selected?
  cell carries a preliminary value does not satisfy the gate. Phase 3 may begin only
  when the Registry is structurally complete (5 rows) and selection-clean (Selected?
  blank in every row). This is a schema property of the Registry.

**Prohibition Battery:**

**Prohibition A -- Marking Ban**: Do not place any `**` marks anywhere in your output
while Phase 2 Check B is in progress -- not on headings, inline, in notes, or in any
other form. No `**` marks may appear until the complete 5-row Registry is written.

**Prohibition B -- Rationalization Block**: If you cannot complete the comparison sentence
for any row -- no specific peer holds or no specific reason applies -- that candidate must
be replaced by the peer named in the Peer column. The replacement source is fixed: it is
the peer from this row, not an alternative selected after reconsidering. Do not revise the
candidate's rationale to manufacture a distinction that was not present at comparison time.
If editing the candidate's rationale would make the comparison sentence completable, that
desire confirms the replacement obligation applies -- the impulse to revise so the
comparison can pass is not permission to reopen the comparison; it is the signal the swap
is mandatory.

**Check C -- AMEND Distribution-Shift Test**
For each of the 3 AMEND directions from 1c, verify: re-running with only this directive
must surface candidate ideas not in the current pool. Sharpen any that would produce the
same candidates under different framing. Output of Check C: final AMEND content.

**Check D -- Inertia Placement**
Does the Phase 1a paragraph appear as the first element in the artifact? If not, reorder.

> **Phase 2 complete** when: all 5 Registry rows written, Selected? blank in every row,
> Checks A/C/D done, no `**` marks in output. Phase 3 may begin only when all four
> conditions are met simultaneously.

---

## Phase 3 -- Finalize

*Phase 3 requires: Phase 2 complete (5-row Registry written, Selected? blank in all rows).*

> **GATE PRECONDITIONS -- both must hold before Phase 3 may begin:**
> - **(a)** All 5 rows of the Peer-Comparison Registry are written in your output
> - **(b)** Selected? is blank across all 5 rows of the Registry
>
> A Registry with fewer than 5 rows does not satisfy (a). A Registry where any
> Selected? cell holds any value does not satisfy (b). Both conditions must hold
> simultaneously before any finalization step below may proceed.

> **Phase 3 opens now.** Phase 2 complete. Peer-comparison validated. AMEND finalized.

Fill Selected? = YES in exactly 5 rows (candidates confirmed in Check B, with any
substitutions from Prohibition B applied). Mark those 5 ideas with `**` on their
headings in the dimension sections. Use the AMEND content finalized in Check C.

Write the artifact to:
`simulations/draft/brainstorm/{{topic}}-brainstorm-{{date}}.md`

```yaml
---
skill: draft-brainstorm
topic: {{topic}}
date: {{date}}
---
```

Artifact order: Inertia paragraph (1a), Phase 0 baseline block (Trajectory / Cost /
Displacement Target), dimension sections (top-5 marked, lens tags removed), Peer-
Comparison Registry, AMEND (3 directions, distribution-shift-verified). Total ideas
including Do Nothing: 20-40.

> **Phase 3 complete.** Artifact written to `simulations/draft/brainstorm/{{topic}}-brainstorm-{{date}}.md`. All phases closed.

> **Session complete.** All five phases executed in sequence. Brainstorm artifact written and closed.
```

---

### V-02 -- Session-Close Completeness Ledger (C-50 floor candidate)

**Axis**: Session-close content enrichment (named-phase ledger)
**Hypothesis**: The R17 backbone session-close reads `> **Session complete.** All five
phases executed in sequence. Brainstorm artifact written and closed.` -- it confirms
completion but does not name which phases closed. V-02 replaces "All five phases executed
in sequence" with an explicit per-phase ledger naming each phase and its brief output.
The session-open tag is unchanged from R17 backbone (generic topic + no preconditions).
C-49 FAIL. Everything else is the V-02 R17 backbone (all phase-level lifecycle signals,
registry, prohibitions, Phase 2 double-mark, Phase 3 double-mark, all C-01..C-48 inherited).

**Expected**: C-01..C-48 (inh from V-02 R17 backbone) + C-49 FAIL (session-open generic,
no phase roster) + C-50 PASS (session-close explicitly names each completed phase with
its output) = **185** under v16. Under hypothetical v19: **197.5** (C-49 FAIL, C-50 PASS +2.5).

Write all 3 lenses. Do not begin Phase 0 until all 3 lenses pass the re-run test.

> **Pre-Phase complete.** All 3 lenses pass the re-run test. Phase 0 opens now.

## Phase 0 -- Inertia Baseline

> **Phase 0 opens now. No preconditions.**

Before generating any candidate ideas, fully specify the Do Nothing option for {{topic}}.

---

## Phase 1 -- Idea Pool

*Phase 1 requires: Phase 0 complete (all four fields + Do Nothing entry written).*

> **Phase 1 opens now.** Phase 0 complete. Do Nothing established.

### 1a. Inertia Frame

Write a paragraph (3-5 sentences) expanding on the Phase 0 baseline for a general reader:
What is the current trajectory for {{topic}}? What does the team inherit if no deliberate
decision is made? What does the path of least resistance produce -- technically,
organizationally, or for users?

This paragraph must appear as the first element in the final artifact, before any ideas.

### 1b. Idea Pool

Using the 3 Pre-Phase lenses as active generation constraints, produce **19-39 additional
candidates** for {{topic}} -- for a total of 20-40 ideas including the Phase 0 Do Nothing
entry. Your output must contain one labeled section per required dimension. Each is a
**mandatory `##` section** -- do not collapse into a flat list, do not omit any. You may
add sections beyond the six required.

**Required dimensions (each must appear as a `##` section):**
- **Scope** -- how much of {{topic}}'s problem space is addressed
- **Timing** -- when the intervention lands in the product lifecycle
- **Integration** -- how it connects to existing systems or teams

```

### 1c. AMEND Draft

Write a draft AMEND section with 3 pool-shift directions. For each:

- Apply the distribution-shift test: re-running with only this directive must produce
  candidate ideas not in the current pool. Different candidates, not the same candidates

Write all five "I chose ... because ___" sentences before evaluating any of them.
Do not assess whether a row passes while other rows remain blank.

**Column rules:**
- **Candidate**: exact idea name from Phase 1b; one of the 5 from Check A
- **Peer**: exact name of one specific unmarked idea in the same `##` section; cannot

### V-03 -- Baseline: V-02 R17 Exact Backbone (session envelope present; no phase roster or ledger)

**Axis**: Session-signal content (phase-named vs. generic)
**Hypothesis**: V-01 and V-02 test session-content enrichment (C-49/C-50) against the
V-02 R17 backbone (185 under v16). V-03 IS the exact V-02 R17 backbone, reproduced as
the isolation baseline for R18. It carries all lifecycle signals through the session level
(Phase 3 double-mark and session open/close as unrewarded C-45..C-48 candidates) but the
session signals carry only generic content -- no phase roster in session-open, no named
phases in session-close. This tests: (a) the 185 v16 ceiling is reproducible entering R18
-- confirming no regression from R17; (b) the delta between V-03 and V-01/V-02/V-04/V-05
under hypothetical v19 is attributable solely to phase-named content in session signals;
(c) session signal existence does not imply session signal content richness -- C-47/C-48
and C-49/C-50 are independently falsifiable.

**Expected**: C-01..C-48 (inh from V-02 R17, unrewarded under v16 except C-43/C-44)
+ C-49 FAIL (session-open generic -- no phase roster) + C-50 FAIL (session-close generic
-- no per-phase ledger) = **185** under v16. Under hypothetical v19: **195** (C-49/C-50
FAIL -- no delta from v18; confirms V-02 R17 ceiling is stable).

You are running the `draft-brainstorm` skill for the topic: {{topic}}

This skill runs in five phases: Pre-Phase (lenses), Phase 0 (inertia baseline),
Phase 1 (pool), Phase 2 (peer-comparison), Phase 3 (finalize). Complete each in order.
Do not advance to the next phase until the current phase is complete.

> **Brainstorm session opens.** Topic: {{topic}}. No preconditions.

---

## Pre-Phase -- Generative Lenses

*Pre-Phase opens now. No preconditions.*

Before writing a single idea or establishing the inertia baseline, define 3 directions
that will actively pull the pool away from its center of gravity. These are production
constraints -- they determine which ideas appear in Phase 1, not which ideas survive
a post-hoc filter.

For each lens:
- **Lens name**: one phrase (e.g., "More Ambitious", "Audience Shift", "Incremental")
- **Direction**: one sentence describing the shift axis
- **Pool impact**: what kinds of ideas appear under this lens that would not appear in a
  default brainstorm? Name candidate types, not framing differences.
- **Re-run test**: if a reader took only this lens and re-ran the brainstorm, would the
  resulting pool contain ideas not in the current pool? Different candidates, not the same
  candidates under different labels. If not, sharpen the lens before proceeding.

Write all 3 lenses. Do not begin Phase 0 until all 3 lenses pass the re-run test.

> **Pre-Phase complete.** All 3 lenses pass the re-run test. Phase 0 opens now.

---

## Phase 0 -- Inertia Baseline

> **Phase 0 opens now. No preconditions.**

Before generating any candidate ideas, fully specify the Do Nothing option for {{topic}}.
This is the most important entry in the pool: it is already in play, and every other
candidate exists to displace it.

Write the following four fields:

**Current Trajectory**: What is happening to {{topic}} right now with no deliberate
intervention? Name the specific direction the system, team, or product is already moving.
(2-3 sentences.)

**Accumulated Cost**: What concretely accumulates -- technically, organizationally, or for
users -- if this trajectory continues for 12 months? Be specific: what is delayed,
degraded, or foreclosed? (2-3 sentences.)

**Displacement Target**: What must a competing idea change about the trajectory to beat
this baseline? State the minimum threshold: "A candidate beats Do Nothing if and only if
it [specific condition]." (1 sentence.)

**Do Nothing** (pool entry):
```
**Pitch**: [One sentence summarizing the status quo trajectory from the analysis above]
**Rationale**: [The Accumulated Cost, compressed to one sentence]
```

> **Phase 0 complete.** All four fields written. Do Nothing established. Phase 1 opens
> below.

---

## Phase 1 -- Idea Pool

*Phase 1 requires: Phase 0 complete (all four fields + Do Nothing entry written).*

> **Phase 1 opens now.** Phase 0 complete. Do Nothing established.

### 1a. Inertia Frame

Write a paragraph (3-5 sentences) expanding on the Phase 0 baseline for a general reader:
What is the current trajectory for {{topic}}? What does the team inherit if no deliberate
decision is made? What does the path of least resistance produce -- technically,
organizationally, or for users?

This paragraph must appear as the first element in the final artifact, before any ideas.

### 1b. Idea Pool

Using the 3 Pre-Phase lenses as active generation constraints, produce **19-39 additional
candidates** for {{topic}} -- for a total of 20-40 ideas including the Phase 0 Do Nothing
entry. Your output must contain one labeled section per required dimension. Each is a
**mandatory `##` section** -- do not collapse into a flat list, do not omit any. You may
add sections beyond the six required.

**Required dimensions (each must appear as a `##` section):**
- **Scope** -- how much of {{topic}}'s problem space is addressed
- **Timing** -- when the intervention lands in the product lifecycle
- **Integration** -- how it connects to existing systems or teams
- **Audience** -- who benefits most
- **Build vs. Buy** -- internal build, external adoption, or extension of existing
- **Status Quo** -- contains exactly the Do Nothing entry from Phase 0

**Lens attribution**: Tag at least 2 ideas per lens inline (e.g., `[Lens: Audience Shift]`).
Aim for at least 6 lens-attributed ideas total. Center-of-gravity ideas are permitted but
must not dominate the pool.

**Do not mark top-5 yet.** Generate the complete pool before selecting. Do not place any
`**` markers on any idea during Phase 1. Marking as you write introduces sequential bias --
finish the pool first.

For each idea (other than Do Nothing):
```
### [Idea Name]

**Pitch**: One sentence.
**Rationale**: Why this serves {{topic}} specifically -- cite a real constraint, user need,
or opportunity. Include one sentence naming how this idea changes the Phase 0 trajectory:
what specifically does it displace or prevent?
```

### 1c. AMEND Draft

Write a draft AMEND section with 3 pool-shift directions. For each:
- Name the shift axis
- Describe what kinds of ideas would appear or disappear
- Apply the distribution-shift test: re-running with only this directive must produce
  candidate ideas not in the current pool. Different candidates, not the same candidates
  under different framing. A direction that shifts only emphasis or category labels without
  introducing different underlying candidates fails this test.

Do not finalize AMEND yet -- it will be verified in Phase 2 Check C.

> **Phase 1 complete.** The full pool (19-39 net-new ideas + Do Nothing = 20-40 total) is
> written. AMEND draft written. No `**` marks in output. Phase 2 may begin.

---

## Phase 2 -- Peer-Comparison

*Phase 2 requires: Phase 1 complete ("Phase 1 complete." signal written above).*

> **Phase 2 opens now.** Phase 1 complete. Full pool written, AMEND drafted.

**Check A -- Sequential Default**
Identify 5 top-5 candidates. Are they the first 5 ideas generated? If yes, rescan the
full pool -- the strongest ideas surface across the whole run, not only at the start.
Output of Check A: 5 candidates advancing to the Registry.

**Check B -- Peer-Comparison Registry**

For each of the 5 candidates, write one row. Do not fill in Selected? during construction.

| # | Candidate (exact name from pool) | Peer (exact name, same ## section, unmarked) | I chose [Candidate] over [Peer] because ___ | Selected? |
|---|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

Write all five "I chose ... because ___" sentences before evaluating any of them.
Do not assess whether a row passes while other rows remain blank.

**Column rules:**
- **Candidate**: exact idea name from Phase 1b; one of the 5 from Check A
- **Peer**: exact name of one specific unmarked idea in the same `##` section; cannot
  be blank
- **"I chose ... because ___"**: complete the sentence with a specific reason tied to
  {{topic}}'s actual constraints (scope, user group, cost, risk); "it is better" or
  "more viable" do not count
- **Selected?**: Phase-advance gate. This column cannot hold any value, and Phase 3
  cannot begin, until both preconditions hold simultaneously: (a) all 5 rows of this
  Registry are written in your output, AND (b) Selected? is blank across all 5 rows.
  A partial Registry has no valid Selected? entries. A Registry where any Selected?
  cell carries a preliminary value does not satisfy the gate. Phase 3 may begin only
  when the Registry is structurally complete (5 rows) and selection-clean (Selected?
  blank in every row). This is a schema property of the Registry.

**Prohibition Battery:**

**Prohibition A -- Marking Ban**: Do not place any `**` marks anywhere in your output
while Phase 2 Check B is in progress -- not on headings, inline, in notes, or in any
other form. No `**` marks may appear until the complete 5-row Registry is written.

**Prohibition B -- Rationalization Block**: If you cannot complete the comparison sentence
for any row -- no specific peer holds or no specific reason applies -- that candidate must
be replaced by the peer named in the Peer column. The replacement source is fixed: it is
the peer from this row, not an alternative selected after reconsidering. Do not revise the
candidate's rationale to manufacture a distinction that was not present at comparison time.
If editing the candidate's rationale would make the comparison sentence completable, that
desire confirms the replacement obligation applies -- the impulse to revise so the
comparison can pass is not permission to reopen the comparison; it is the signal the swap
is mandatory.

**Check C -- AMEND Distribution-Shift Test**
For each of the 3 AMEND directions from 1c, verify: re-running with only this directive
must surface candidate ideas not in the current pool. Sharpen any that would produce the
same candidates under different framing. Output of Check C: final AMEND content.

**Check D -- Inertia Placement**
Does the Phase 1a paragraph appear as the first element in the artifact? If not, reorder.

> **Phase 2 complete** when: all 5 Registry rows written, Selected? blank in every row,
> Checks A/C/D done, no `**` marks in output. Phase 3 may begin only when all four
> conditions are met simultaneously.

---

## Phase 3 -- Finalize

*Phase 3 requires: Phase 2 complete (5-row Registry written, Selected? blank in all rows).*

> **GATE PRECONDITIONS -- both must hold before Phase 3 may begin:**
> - **(a)** All 5 rows of the Peer-Comparison Registry are written in your output
> - **(b)** Selected? is blank across all 5 rows of the Registry
>
> A Registry with fewer than 5 rows does not satisfy (a). A Registry where any
> Selected? cell holds any value does not satisfy (b). Both conditions must hold
> simultaneously before any finalization step below may proceed.

> **Phase 3 opens now.** Phase 2 complete. Peer-comparison validated. AMEND finalized.

Fill Selected? = YES in exactly 5 rows (candidates confirmed in Check B, with any
substitutions from Prohibition B applied). Mark those 5 ideas with `**` on their
headings in the dimension sections. Use the AMEND content finalized in Check C.

Write the artifact to:
`simulations/draft/brainstorm/{{topic}}-brainstorm-{{date}}.md`

```yaml
---
skill: draft-brainstorm
topic: {{topic}}
date: {{date}}
---
```

Artifact order: Inertia paragraph (1a), Phase 0 baseline block (Trajectory / Cost /
Displacement Target), dimension sections (top-5 marked, lens tags removed), Peer-
Comparison Registry, AMEND (3 directions, distribution-shift-verified). Total ideas
including Do Nothing: 20-40.

> **Phase 3 complete.** Artifact written to `simulations/draft/brainstorm/{{topic}}-brainstorm-{{date}}.md`. All phases closed.

> **Session complete.** All five phases executed in sequence. Brainstorm artifact written and closed.

## Combination variations

---

### V-04 -- Full Phase-Named Session Signals (C-49 + C-50 combined; first to 200)

**Axis**: Session-open phase roster (arrow notation) + session-close phase ledger (named
phases with brief output)
**Hypothesis**: V-01 tests C-49 alone (session-open roster, C-50 FAIL). V-02 tests C-50
alone (session-close ledger, C-49 FAIL). V-04 combines both: the session-open tag names
the 5 phases in arrow-sequence notation (C-49 carrier), and the session-close tag names
each completed phase with its brief output (C-50 carrier). Both session signals are
phase-content-enriched simultaneously. This is the C-49 + C-50 combination and is
projected as the first variation to reach 200 under hypothetical v19. Everything else
inherits unchanged from V-02 R17 backbone (all C-01..C-48 carried as-is).

**Expected**: C-01..C-48 (inh from V-02 R17 backbone) + C-49 PASS (session-open names
phases in arrow-sequence) + C-50 PASS (session-close names each phase with output) =
**185** under v16. Under hypothetical v19: **200** (C-49 PASS +2.5, C-50 PASS +2.5 --
first to 200).

## Pre-Phase -- Generative Lenses

*Pre-Phase opens now. No preconditions.*

Before writing a single idea or establishing the inertia baseline, define 3 directions
that will actively pull the pool away from its center of gravity. These are production
constraints -- they determine which ideas appear in Phase 1, not which ideas survive
a post-hoc filter.

For each lens:
- **Lens name**: one phrase (e.g., "More Ambitious", "Audience Shift", "Incremental")
- **Direction**: one sentence describing the shift axis
- **Pool impact**: what kinds of ideas appear under this lens that would not appear in a
  default brainstorm? Name candidate types, not framing differences.
- **Re-run test**: if a reader took only this lens and re-ran the brainstorm, would the
  resulting pool contain ideas not in the current pool? Different candidates, not the same
  candidates under different labels. If not, sharpen the lens before proceeding.

Write all 3 lenses. Do not begin Phase 0 until all 3 lenses pass the re-run test.

> **Pre-Phase complete.** All 3 lenses pass the re-run test. Phase 0 opens now.

---

## Phase 0 -- Inertia Baseline

> **Phase 0 opens now. No preconditions.**

Before generating any candidate ideas, fully specify the Do Nothing option for {{topic}}.
This is the most important entry in the pool: it is already in play, and every other
candidate exists to displace it.

Write the following four fields:

**Current Trajectory**: What is happening to {{topic}} right now with no deliberate
intervention? Name the specific direction the system, team, or product is already moving.
(2-3 sentences.)

**Accumulated Cost**: What concretely accumulates -- technically, organizationally, or for
users -- if this trajectory continues for 12 months? Be specific: what is delayed,
degraded, or foreclosed? (2-3 sentences.)

**Displacement Target**: What must a competing idea change about the trajectory to beat
this baseline? State the minimum threshold: "A candidate beats Do Nothing if and only if
it [specific condition]." (1 sentence.)

**Do Nothing** (pool entry):
```
**Pitch**: [One sentence summarizing the status quo trajectory from the analysis above]
**Rationale**: [The Accumulated Cost, compressed to one sentence]
```

> **Phase 0 complete.** All four fields written. Do Nothing established. Phase 1 opens
> below.

---

## Phase 1 -- Idea Pool

*Phase 1 requires: Phase 0 complete (all four fields + Do Nothing entry written).*

> **Phase 1 opens now.** Phase 0 complete. Do Nothing established.

### 1a. Inertia Frame

Write a paragraph (3-5 sentences) expanding on the Phase 0 baseline for a general reader:
What is the current trajectory for {{topic}}? What does the team inherit if no deliberate
decision is made? What does the path of least resistance produce -- technically,
organizationally, or for users?

This paragraph must appear as the first element in the final artifact, before any ideas.

### 1b. Idea Pool

Using the 3 Pre-Phase lenses as active generation constraints, produce **19-39 additional
candidates** for {{topic}} -- for a total of 20-40 ideas including the Phase 0 Do Nothing
entry. Your output must contain one labeled section per required dimension. Each is a
**mandatory `##` section** -- do not collapse into a flat list, do not omit any. You may
add sections beyond the six required.

**Required dimensions (each must appear as a `##` section):**
- **Scope** -- how much of {{topic}}'s problem space is addressed
- **Timing** -- when the intervention lands in the product lifecycle
- **Integration** -- how it connects to existing systems or teams
- **Audience** -- who benefits most
- **Build vs. Buy** -- internal build, external adoption, or extension of existing
- **Status Quo** -- contains exactly the Do Nothing entry from Phase 0

**Lens attribution**: Tag at least 2 ideas per lens inline (e.g., `[Lens: Audience Shift]`).
Aim for at least 6 lens-attributed ideas total. Center-of-gravity ideas are permitted but
must not dominate the pool.

**Do not mark top-5 yet.** Generate the complete pool before selecting. Do not place any
`**` markers on any idea during Phase 1. Marking as you write introduces sequential bias --
finish the pool first.

For each idea (other than Do Nothing):
```
### [Idea Name]

**Pitch**: One sentence.
**Rationale**: Why this serves {{topic}} specifically -- cite a real constraint, user need,
or opportunity. Include one sentence naming how this idea changes the Phase 0 trajectory:
what specifically does it displace or prevent?

### 1c. AMEND Draft

Write a draft AMEND section with 3 pool-shift directions. For each:

- Apply the distribution-shift test: re-running with only this directive must produce
  candidate ideas not in the current pool. Different candidates, not the same candidates

For each of the 5 candidates, write one row. Do not fill in Selected? during construction.

| # | Candidate (exact name from pool) | Peer (exact name, same ## section, unmarked) | I chose [Candidate] over [Peer] because ___ | Selected? |

| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

Write all five "I chose ... because ___" sentences before evaluating any of them.
Do not assess whether a row passes while other rows remain blank.

**Column rules:**
- **Candidate**: exact idea name from Phase 1b; one of the 5 from Check A
- **Peer**: exact name of one specific unmarked idea in the same `##` section; cannot
  be blank
- **"I chose ... because ___"**: complete the sentence with a specific reason tied to
  {{topic}}'s actual constraints (scope, user group, cost, risk); "it is better" or
  "more viable" do not count
- **Selected?**: Phase-advance gate. This column cannot hold any value, and Phase 3
  cannot begin, until both preconditions hold simultaneously: (a) all 5 rows of this

### V-05 -- Numbered Session Roster + Echo-Completion Ledger (alternate path to 200)

**Axis**: Session-open phase roster (numbered enumeration) + session-close echo-completion
ledger (each phase named with its specific close signal output)
**Hypothesis**: V-04 achieves C-49 via arrow-sequence notation and C-50 via a brief
parenthetical output per phase. V-05 tests alternative forms for both signals: (a) the
session-open uses numbered enumeration ("1. Pre-Phase (lenses) 2. Phase 0 (inertia
baseline)...") rather than arrow notation -- testing whether C-49 requires a specific
notation form or only that phase names appear; (b) the session-close uses
echo-completion form, where each phase's entry names not just the phase but the specific
output echoed from that phase's close tag (e.g., "Pre-Phase: 3 lenses passed re-run test.
Phase 0: Do Nothing established. Phase 1: 19-39 net-new + Do Nothing written.
Phase 2: Registry complete, Selected? filled. Phase 3: artifact written.") -- testing
whether C-50 has a stronger form (echo-completion, hypothesis C-51) beyond the floor
(named-ledger). V-05 also provides the most information-rich session-close of any R18
variation, as a forward signal for C-51 if v20 is developed.

**Expected**: C-01..C-48 (inh from V-02 R17 backbone) + C-49 PASS (session-open names
5 phases in numbered enumeration -- different notation from V-01/V-04, same criterion)
+ C-50 PASS (session-close echo-completion form -- names each phase + specific completion
output) = **185** under v16. Under hypothetical v19: **200** (C-49 PASS +2.5, C-50 PASS
+2.5 -- alternate path to 200 via different notation forms; confirms notation form does
not block C-49 and echo-completion satisfies C-50 floor). Under hypothetical v20 (if C-51
adds echo-completion as floor): **202.5** (V-05 forward-earns C-51 by echo; V-04 fails
C-51 because parenthetical output is briefer than a completion-signal echo).

## Pre-Phase -- Generative Lenses

*Pre-Phase opens now. No preconditions.*

Before writing a single idea or establishing the inertia baseline, define 3 directions
that will actively pull the pool away from its center of gravity. These are production
constraints -- they determine which ideas appear in Phase 1, not which ideas survive
a post-hoc filter.

For each lens:
- **Lens name**: one phrase (e.g., "More Ambitious", "Audience Shift", "Incremental")
- **Direction**: one sentence describing the shift axis
- **Pool impact**: what kinds of ideas appear under this lens that would not appear in a
  default brainstorm? Name candidate types, not framing differences.
- **Re-run test**: if a reader took only this lens and re-ran the brainstorm, would the
  resulting pool contain ideas not in the current pool? Different candidates, not the same
  candidates under different labels. If not, sharpen the lens before proceeding.

Write all 3 lenses. Do not begin Phase 0 until all 3 lenses pass the re-run test.

> **Pre-Phase complete.** All 3 lenses pass the re-run test. Phase 0 opens now.

---

## Phase 0 -- Inertia Baseline

> **Phase 0 opens now. No preconditions.**

Before generating any candidate ideas, fully specify the Do Nothing option for {{topic}}.
This is the most important entry in the pool: it is already in play, and every other
candidate exists to displace it.

Write the following four fields:

**Current Trajectory**: What is happening to {{topic}} right now with no deliberate
intervention? Name the specific direction the system, team, or product is already moving.
(2-3 sentences.)

**Accumulated Cost**: What concretely accumulates -- technically, organizationally, or for
users -- if this trajectory continues for 12 months? Be specific: what is delayed,
degraded, or foreclosed? (2-3 sentences.)

**Displacement Target**: What must a competing idea change about the trajectory to beat
this baseline? State the minimum threshold: "A candidate beats Do Nothing if and only if
it [specific condition]." (1 sentence.)

**Do Nothing** (pool entry):
```
**Pitch**: [One sentence summarizing the status quo trajectory from the analysis above]
**Rationale**: [The Accumulated Cost, compressed to one sentence]
```

> **Phase 0 complete.** All four fields written. Do Nothing established. Phase 1 opens
> below.

---

## Phase 1 -- Idea Pool

*Phase 1 requires: Phase 0 complete (all four fields + Do Nothing entry written).*

> **Phase 1 opens now.** Phase 0 complete. Do Nothing established.

### 1a. Inertia Frame

Write a paragraph (3-5 sentences) expanding on the Phase 0 baseline for a general reader:
What is the current trajectory for {{topic}}? What does the team inherit if no deliberate
decision is made? What does the path of least resistance produce -- technically,
organizationally, or for users?

This paragraph must appear as the first element in the final artifact, before any ideas.

### 1b. Idea Pool

Using the 3 Pre-Phase lenses as active generation constraints, produce **19-39 additional
candidates** for {{topic}} -- for a total of 20-40 ideas including the Phase 0 Do Nothing
entry. Your output must contain one labeled section per required dimension. Each is a
**mandatory `##` section** -- do not collapse into a flat list, do not omit any. You may
add sections beyond the six required.

**Required dimensions (each must appear as a `##` section):**
- **Scope** -- how much of {{topic}}'s problem space is addressed
- **Timing** -- when the intervention lands in the product lifecycle
- **Integration** -- how it connects to existing systems or teams
- **Audience** -- who benefits most
- **Build vs. Buy** -- internal build, external adoption, or extension of existing
- **Status Quo** -- contains exactly the Do Nothing entry from Phase 0

**Lens attribution**: Tag at least 2 ideas per lens inline (e.g., `[Lens: Audience Shift]`).
Aim for at least 6 lens-attributed ideas total. Center-of-gravity ideas are permitted but
must not dominate the pool.

**Do not mark top-5 yet.** Generate the complete pool before selecting. Do not place any
`**` markers on any idea during Phase 1. Marking as you write introduces sequential bias --
finish the pool first.

For each idea (other than Do Nothing):
```
### [Idea Name]

**Pitch**: One sentence.
**Rationale**: Why this serves {{topic}} specifically -- cite a real constraint, user need,
or opportunity. Include one sentence naming how this idea changes the Phase 0 trajectory:
what specifically does it displace or prevent?
```

### 1c. AMEND Draft

Write a draft AMEND section with 3 pool-shift directions. For each:
- Name the shift axis
- Describe what kinds of ideas would appear or disappear
- Apply the distribution-shift test: re-running with only this directive must produce
  candidate ideas not in the current pool. Different candidates, not the same candidates
  under different framing. A direction that shifts only emphasis or category labels without
  introducing different underlying candidates fails this test.

Do not finalize AMEND yet -- it will be verified in Phase 2 Check C.

> **Phase 1 complete.** The full pool (19-39 net-new ideas + Do Nothing = 20-40 total) is
> written. AMEND draft written. No `**` marks in output. Phase 2 may begin.

---

## Phase 2 -- Peer-Comparison

*Phase 2 requires: Phase 1 complete ("Phase 1 complete." signal written above).*

> **Phase 2 opens now.** Phase 1 complete. Full pool written, AMEND drafted.

**Check A -- Sequential Default**
Identify 5 top-5 candidates. Are they the first 5 ideas generated? If yes, rescan the
full pool -- the strongest ideas surface across the whole run, not only at the start.
Output of Check A: 5 candidates advancing to the Registry.

**Check B -- Peer-Comparison Registry**

For each of the 5 candidates, write one row. Do not fill in Selected? during construction.

| # | Candidate (exact name from pool) | Peer (exact name, same ## section, unmarked) | I chose [Candidate] over [Peer] because ___ | Selected? |
|---|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

Write all five "I chose ... because ___" sentences before evaluating any of them.
Do not assess whether a row passes while other rows remain blank.

**Column rules:**
- **Candidate**: exact idea name from Phase 1b; one of the 5 from Check A
- **Peer**: exact name of one specific unmarked idea in the same `##` section; cannot
  be blank
- **"I chose ... because ___"**: complete the sentence with a specific reason tied to
  {{topic}}'s actual constraints (scope, user group, cost, risk); "it is better" or
  "more viable" do not count
- **Selected?**: Phase-advance gate. This column cannot hold any value, and Phase 3
  cannot begin, until both preconditions hold simultaneously: (a) all 5 rows of this
  Registry are written in your output, AND (b) Selected? is blank across all 5 rows.
  A partial Registry has no valid Selected? entries. A Registry where any Selected?
  cell carries a preliminary value does not satisfy the gate. Phase 3 may begin only
  when the Registry is structurally complete (5 rows) and selection-clean (Selected?
  blank in every row). This is a schema property of the Registry.

**Prohibition Battery:**

**Prohibition A -- Marking Ban**: Do not place any `**` marks anywhere in your output
while Phase 2 Check B is in progress -- not on headings, inline, in notes, or in any
other form. No `**` marks may appear until the complete 5-row Registry is written.

**Prohibition B -- Rationalization Block**: If you cannot complete the comparison sentence
for any row -- no specific peer holds or no specific reason applies -- that candidate must
be replaced by the peer named in the Peer column. The replacement source is fixed: it is
the peer from this row, not an alternative selected after reconsidering. Do not revise the
candidate's rationale to manufacture a distinction that was not present at comparison time.
If editing the candidate's rationale would make the comparison sentence completable, that
desire confirms the replacement obligation applies -- the impulse to revise so the
comparison can pass is not permission to reopen the comparison; it is the signal the swap
is mandatory.

**Check C -- AMEND Distribution-Shift Test**
For each of the 3 AMEND directions from 1c, verify: re-running with only this directive
must surface candidate ideas not in the current pool. Sharpen any that would produce the
same candidates under different framing. Output of Check C: final AMEND content.

**Check D -- Inertia Placement**
Does the Phase 1a paragraph appear as the first element in the artifact? If not, reorder.

> **Phase 2 complete** when: all 5 Registry rows written, Selected? blank in every row,
> Checks A/C/D done, no `**` marks in output. Phase 3 may begin only when all four
> conditions are met simultaneously.

---

## Phase 3 -- Finalize

*Phase 3 requires: Phase 2 complete (5-row Registry written, Selected? blank in all rows).*

> **GATE PRECONDITIONS -- both must hold before Phase 3 may begin:**
> - **(a)** All 5 rows of the Peer-Comparison Registry are written in your output
> - **(b)** Selected? is blank across all 5 rows of the Registry
>
> A Registry with fewer than 5 rows does not satisfy (a). A Registry where any
> Selected? cell holds any value does not satisfy (b). Both conditions must hold
> simultaneously before any finalization step below may proceed.

> **Phase 3 opens now.** Phase 2 complete. Peer-comparison validated. AMEND finalized.

Fill Selected? = YES in exactly 5 rows (candidates confirmed in Check B, with any
substitutions from Prohibition B applied). Mark those 5 ideas with `**` on their
headings in the dimension sections. Use the AMEND content finalized in Check C.

Write the artifact to:
`simulations/draft/brainstorm/{{topic}}-brainstorm-{{date}}.md`

```yaml
---
skill: draft-brainstorm
topic: {{topic}}
date: {{date}}
---
```

Artifact order: Inertia paragraph (1a), Phase 0 baseline block (Trajectory / Cost /
Displacement Target), dimension sections (top-5 marked, lens tags removed), Peer-
Comparison Registry, AMEND (3 directions, distribution-shift-verified). Total ideas
including Do Nothing: 20-40.

> **Phase 3 complete.** Artifact written to `simulations/draft/brainstorm/{{topic}}-brainstorm-{{date}}.md`. All phases closed.

> **Session complete.** Pre-Phase: 3 lenses passed re-run test. Phase 0: Do Nothing established. Phase 1: 19-39 net-new ideas + Do Nothing written. Phase 2: 5-row Registry complete, Selected? filled in all rows. Phase 3: artifact written to `simulations/draft/brainstorm/{{topic}}-brainstorm-{{date}}.md`. Brainstorm closed.

## Score projection summary

| Variation | v16 (max 185) | hyp v17 (+C-45/C-46) | hyp v18 (+C-47/C-48) | hyp v19 (+C-49/C-50) | C-49 | C-50 |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------|------|
| V-01 | 185 | 190 | 195 | 197.5 | PASS (arrow roster) | FAIL |
| V-02 | 185 | 190 | 195 | 197.5 | FAIL | PASS (named ledger) |
| V-03 | 185 | 190 | 195 | 195 | FAIL | FAIL (baseline) |
| V-04 | 185 | 190 | 195 | **200** | PASS (arrow roster) | PASS (named ledger) |
| V-05 | 185 | 190 | 195 | **200** | PASS (numbered enum) | PASS (echo-completion) |

**V-04 and V-05 are the first variations projected to reach 200** (under hypothetical v19).
**V-05 additionally forward-earns a hypothetical C-51** (echo-completion form of session-close)
by echoing each phase's specific close-signal output in the session-close tag -- if v20
sharpens C-50 the way C-31 sharpened C-29, V-05 is already there.

**Key interference note**: C-49 and C-48 are not in conflict -- C-48 requires the opening
blockquote to exist; C-49 additionally requires the opening blockquote to name the phase
sequence. Both are satisfied simultaneously in V-01, V-04, V-05. Same for C-47/C-50 on
the session-close signal.
