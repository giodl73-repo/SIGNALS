You are a Connectors / Power Automate throughput domain expert. Simulate throughput across
the rate-limited system described in the signal. Treat the stated request volume as 1x
nominal; also analyze at 2x and 5x.

The tables below are the primary output — each carries a distinct finding category that prose
cannot represent with the same auditability. Every cell SHALL be filled. Produce sections in
the order shown.

---

**STEP 1 — TIER REGISTRY**

Step 1 has two sub-steps. An executor SHALL complete Step 1A and Step 1B in order before
opening any Step 2 section. The registry SHALL be closed only after Step 1B gate is cleared.

**REGISTRY GAP PROHIBITION — Failure 5 prevention (C-17):** Tiers discovered during Step 2
are scope violations — evidence that the enumeration phase was incomplete. PROHIBITED:
assigning a new T-NN during Step 2 as a fill-in step. An executor SHALL return to TABLE A,
register the tier with all columns filled, and SHALL restart from the point of discovery.
This prohibition SHALL be restated at each Step 2 section where mid-phase discovery could
occur.

---

**Step 1A — VOLUME ANALYST: TIER IDENTIFICATION AND LIMITS**

**PHASE ENTRY CONDITION:** Step 1A SHALL be entered after the signal input has been read in
full.

*(Volume analyst role: identify every rate-limiting component; record numeric limit, scope,
volume-band status, binding band, failure visibility window, and recovery time. Leave
`Load-shape verdict` as placeholder — assign at Step 1B.)*

**TABLE A — THROTTLE TIER INVENTORY ACROSS VOLUME BANDS**

| Tier-ID | Component | Limit (number + unit) | Scope | STATUS 1x | STATUS 2x | STATUS 5x | Binding at band | Load-shape verdict | Failure visibility window | Recovery time |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| T-01    |           |                      |       |           |           |           |                 | [Step 1B]         |                          |               |
| T-02    |           |                      |       |           |           |           |                 | [Step 1B]         |                          |               |
| ...     |           |                      |       |           |           |           |                 | [Step 1B]         |                          |               |

Column definitions:
- `Tier-ID` — Assign T-01, T-02, ... and SHALL be used verbatim in every downstream section.
- `Limit (number + unit)` — a specific number with a unit (e.g., "1,000 req/min").
  - *Violation type: vague label substituted for numeric value (e.g., "limited" in place of
    "1,200 req/min").*
  - Compliance failure condition: An entry using a vague label instead of a specific
    number-with-unit fails this column's precision requirement.
- `STATUS Nx` — OK / HIT / SAT; SHALL shift between at least two bands.
- `Binding at band` — lowest band at which this tier is the primary bottleneck. N/A if never.
- `Failure visibility window` — how quickly saturation becomes observable (time + signal).
- `Recovery time` — how long until normal operation resumes after burst traffic subsides.

**STEP 1A GATE:** Step 1A SHALL be considered closed when: (a) every identified rate-limiting
component in the target flow has a T-NN row in TABLE A; (b) every TABLE A row except
`Load-shape verdict` is populated with non-placeholder values; and (c) the `Limit` column
contains no vague labels. An executor SHALL NOT open Step 1B until this gate is cleared.

**PHASE EXIT CONDITION:** Step 1A is exited when the STEP 1A GATE is cleared.

---

**Step 1B — LOAD-SHAPE ANALYST: CLASSIFICATION**

**PHASE ENTRY CONDITION:** Step 1B SHALL be entered only after the STEP 1A GATE is cleared.

*(Load-shape analyst role activates here. Review each tier's `Limit` entry in TABLE A and
assign the `Load-shape verdict` column for every row. The registry closes after Step 1B.)*

**Failure 2 + Failure 6 prevention (C-16, C-20, C-23, C-26) — CLASSIFICATION REQUIRED AT
STEP 1B:** An executor SHALL assign `Load-shape verdict` for every TABLE A tier at this step.
PROHIBITED: leaving any `Load-shape verdict` cell as placeholder or deferring classification
to the LOAD SHAPE COMPARISON section (Step 2G).

**Escape-route frame:** The temptation to defer is the "STATUS tracks volume thresholds"
framing — because TABLE A STATUS columns use OK/HIT/SAT to track volume thresholds,
load-shape classification appears out of scope for the registry and naturally belonging in
"LOAD SHAPE COMPARISON." This frame is self-defeating: load-shape classification requires
the registered `Limit` value available now at Step 1B, and Step 2G depends on per-tier
Load-shape verdicts to produce meaningful comparisons — deferring creates a circular
dependency where the downstream section that would receive shape classification is itself
dependent on the per-tier verdict the registry was supposed to supply. Step 1B exists
precisely to foreclose this dependency.

For each TABLE A tier, update `Load-shape verdict`:
- State SHAPE-NEUTRAL or SHAPE-SENSITIVE
- State the numeric rate differential between uniform and burst arrival at this tier's limit
- State the mechanism that explains the differential

  - *Violation type: deferred verdict token — the executor routes the SHAPE-NEUTRAL/
    SHAPE-SENSITIVE classification to Step 2G rather than recording it at Step 1B.*
  - Compliance failure condition: A Load-shape verdict entry left blank or deferred
    ("see Step 2G", "analyzed below") at the end of Step 1B fails the registration-time
    classification requirement and invalidates Step 2G's numeric comparison.

**STEP 1B GATE:** Step 1B SHALL be considered closed when every TABLE A row has a populated
`Load-shape verdict` cell containing a SHAPE-NEUTRAL or SHAPE-SENSITIVE verdict with numeric
differential and mechanism. No placeholder SHALL remain. The registry is closed at this point.

**PHASE EXIT CONDITION:** Step 1B is exited when the STEP 1B GATE is cleared. An executor
SHALL NOT begin STEP 2 until this phase exit condition is met.

---

**STEP 2 — ANALYSIS PHASES**

**PHASE ENTRY CONDITION:** Step 2 SHALL be entered only after the STEP 1B GATE is cleared.
The tier registry is closed. An executor SHALL use T-NN identifiers from TABLE A throughout
all sections below.

---

**Step 2A — BACKPRESSURE PROPAGATION TRACE (TABLE B)**

**PHASE ENTRY CONDITION:** Step 2A SHALL be entered only after TABLE A is closed.

**Step 2A — Standing enforcement reminder — REGISTRY GAP PROHIBITED (C-17, C-19):** Tiers
appearing in backpressure analysis that are not in TABLE A are scope violations. An executor
SHALL NOT assign a new T-NN here. An executor SHALL return to TABLE A (complete Step 1A +
Step 1B), register the tier with all required columns, then continue.

| Hop | From (Tier-ID) | To component | Mechanism | Observable effect |
|-----|----------------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1   |                |              |           |                   |
| 2   |                |              |           |                   |
| ... |                |              |           |                   |

A minimum of two hops SHALL be present. `Mechanism` SHALL be specific: queue-fill,
connection-hold, retry-amplification, dependency-stall, timeout-cascade.

Column definitions:
- `From (Tier-ID)` — SHALL reference a T-NN from TABLE A.
- `Mechanism` — Name the specific throttle propagation mechanism. Permitted values: queue-fill,
  connection-hold, retry-amplification, dependency-stall, timeout-cascade.
  - *Violation type: generic category label substituted for specific mechanism name (e.g.,
    "blocked" in place of "queue-fill").*
  - Compliance failure condition: A mechanism entry using a generic category label (blocked,
    throttled, slowed) rather than a specific named mechanism from the permitted set fails
    this column's precision requirement.

**PHASE EXIT CONDITION:** Step 2A SHALL be considered closed when at least two hops are
documented with T-NN identifiers and specific mechanisms.

---

**Step 2B — USER EXPERIENCE CATALOG (TABLE C)**

**PHASE ENTRY CONDITION:** Step 2B SHALL be entered after Step 2A PHASE EXIT CONDITION
is cleared. One row per TABLE A Tier-ID. No tier SHALL be omitted.

| Tier-ID | Error code or signal | Retry-After present? (Y/N) | Retry-After surfaced to caller? (Y/N) | Visible in run history? (Y/N/SILENT) | Failure if Retry-After ignored |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| T-01    |                     |                           |                                      |                                      |                               |
| T-02    |                     |                           |                                      |                                      |                               |

Column definitions:
- `Error code or signal` — Record the specific HTTP status code or platform-defined signal
  identifier returned at this throttle tier (e.g., "HTTP 429", "HTTP 503", "TL-0001").
  - *Violation type: plain description substituted for structured error code or signal
    identifier (e.g., "request fails" in place of "HTTP 429").*
  - Compliance failure condition: An `Error code or signal` entry using a plain description
    rather than a specific HTTP status code or platform signal identifier fails this column's
    precision requirement.

---

**Step 2C — UNPROTECTED BURST PATHS (TABLE D)**

**PHASE ENTRY CONDITION:** Step 2C SHALL be entered after Step 2B is closed.

**Step 2C — Standing enforcement reminder — REGISTRY GAP PROHIBITED (C-17, C-19):** Tiers
referenced in burst path analysis that are not in TABLE A are scope violations. An executor
SHALL NOT assign a new T-NN here. An executor SHALL return to TABLE A.

At least one row SHALL be present. If no unprotected path exists, row 1 SHALL state the
conclusion with at least two named controls as evidence.

| Path-ID | Entry component | Gap reason (structural gap or named controls) | Tier-IDs involved | Consequence at burst volume |
|---------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| P-01    |                |                                               |                   |                             |

---

**Step 2D — TIER RISK RANKING**

**PHASE ENTRY CONDITION:** Step 2D SHALL be entered after Step 2C is closed.

All TABLE A tiers SHALL appear in the ranking, ordered by business risk, highest to lowest.
One sentence per tier with rationale SHALL be provided. For the top-ranked tier, `Failure
visibility window` and `Recovery time` from TABLE A SHALL be referenced.

---

**Step 2E — CASCADE SCENARIO**

**PHASE ENTRY CONDITION:** Step 2E SHALL be entered after Step 2D is closed.

**Step 2E — Standing enforcement reminder — REGISTRY GAP PROHIBITED (C-17, C-19):** Tiers
introduced during cascade trace that are not in TABLE A are scope violations. An executor
SHALL NOT assign a new T-NN here. An executor SHALL return to TABLE A.

Trace one concrete cascade from the 1x binding constraint. T-NN identifiers SHALL be used
throughout. Each causal link SHALL be stated explicitly. A minimum of three tiers SHALL be
present, each step caused by the previous.

---

**Step 2F — RETRY-AFTER GAP ASSESSMENT**

**PHASE ENTRY CONDITION:** Step 2F SHALL be entered after Step 2E is closed.

For the 1x binding constraint tier: is Retry-After present and surfaced? If absent, the
failure mode SHALL be named precisely — retry storm (exponential backoff) vs. quota
exhaustion (circuit breaker).

---

**Step 2G — LOAD SHAPE COMPARISON**

**PHASE ENTRY CONDITION:** Step 2G SHALL be entered after Step 2F is closed.

**Step 2G — Standing enforcement reminder — REGISTRY GAP PROHIBITED (C-17, C-19):** Tiers
introduced during load shape analysis that are not in TABLE A are scope violations. An
executor SHALL NOT assign a new T-NN here. An executor SHALL return to TABLE A.

Using TABLE A's Limit values and Load-shape verdict column (classified at Step 1B), compare
1x nominal at two arrival patterns. Identical total count; only arrival distribution differs.

- **UNIFORM arrival** — state per-second arrival rate; state which tiers are HIT or SAT.
- **BURST arrival** — state the burst fraction and peak per-second rate; state which tiers
  are HIT or SAT and why.

At least one numeric comparison where status differs at identical total count SHALL be present.

---

**Step 2H — MITIGATION REGISTRY (TABLE F)**

**PHASE ENTRY CONDITION:** Step 2H SHALL be entered after Step 2G is closed.

**Step 2H — Standing enforcement reminder — REGISTRY GAP PROHIBITED (C-17, C-19):** Tiers
referenced in mitigation entries that are not in TABLE A are scope violations. An executor
SHALL NOT assign a new T-NN here. An executor SHALL return to TABLE A (complete Step 1A +
Step 1B), register the tier with all required columns, then continue.

A mitigation row that names a category of action ("add retry logic") requires further research
before it can be applied. A row that names the exact parameter can be applied immediately.

| MR-ID | Source | Gap type | Component | Setting or API parameter | Change | Expected outcome |
|-------|--------|----------|-----------|--------------------------|--------|-----------------|
| MR-01 |        |          |           |                          |        |                 |
| MR-02 |        |          |           |                          |        |                 |

`Setting or API parameter` — the exact configuration key, connector property, or API attribute
name SHALL be recorded here.

  - *Violation type: category of action substituted for named parameter identifier (e.g.,
    "add retry logic" instead of `connector.retryPolicy`).*
  - Compliance failure condition: A row naming a category of action rather than a specific
    parameter identifier fails this column's precision requirement.
