# trace-permissions Variate — Round 16
**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Rubric:** v15 (C-01 through C-44)
**Session note:** R15-V-04 (inferred) scored 35/36 under v15 — fails only C-44 (ROLE SEQUENCING
MANDATE bilateral sub-clause co-declaration; Phase 0 mandate must co-name SHALL-D-EXT-C35 and
SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 as siblings with SE-side/CS-side identification, closing mandate-level parity
that C-38+C-40 establish at the declaration level only).

**State entering Round 16:**

| Variation | v15 score | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| R15-V-04 (inferred) | 99.7 (35/36) | Passes C-40 (SHALL-F sub-clause), C-41 (attestation cross-link mandate), C-42 (scope roster + standalone non-overlap), C-43 (labeled NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION block); fails C-44 only |
| R15-V-03 | 99.7 (35/36) | Passes C-44 (bilateral mandate); fails C-43 (non-overlap is prose, not labeled block) |
| R15-V-01 | 99.4 (34/36) | Fails both C-43 and C-44 |

**Path to 36/36:** R15-V-04 base + R15-V-03's bilateral mandate co-declaration. C-44 requires
Phase 0 mandate to co-name SHALL-D-EXT-C35 (SE-side) and SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 (CS-side) as siblings.
Both C-43 and C-44 are in place; no other criterion gap exists.

## Variation Map

| Variation | Axis | Hypothesis |
|-----------|------|------------|
| V-01 | Single-axis: C-44 bilateral mandate on V-04 base — Phase 0 ROLE SEQUENCING MANDATE co-names SHALL-D-EXT-C35 (SE-side) and SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 (CS-side) as siblings with verification row citations | R15-V-04 already satisfies C-40, C-43. Adding bilateral sibling co-declaration closes C-44. Expected: 36/36 (100.0). |
| V-02 | Single-axis: Phase 3 bilateral echo — Phase 3 mandate explicitly names CA-1.9 (SHALL-D-EXT-C35) and CA-1.6 (SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3) as bilateral verification siblings; Phase 0 reverts to V-04 non-bilateral listing | Tests whether bilateral naming at Phase 3 independently satisfies C-44 (Phase 3 level vs. Phase 0 level). Expected: 35/36 (fails C-44 if Phase 0 placement is required). |
| V-03 | Single-axis: NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION with explicit CA row cross-references — the labeled NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION block cites CA-1.4, CA-1.7, CA-1.9 by row ID within the block body, parallel to how STRUCTURAL AXIS NON-INTERFERENCE DECLARATION uses A-N row labels | On V-01 base (passes C-44). Tests whether row-citing specificity inside the labeled block produces a new structural pattern beyond C-43. Expected: 36/36 or reveals structural gap. |
| V-04 | Combined: V-01 (C-44 bilateral mandate) + V-03 (NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION with CA row citations) | Two independent axes: C-44 satisfied at mandate level, C-43 structurally hardened with explicit row citations. Expected: 36/36. |
| V-05 | Combined: V-01 + V-02 + V-03 on R15-V-04 base — definitive compound | All three axes: bilateral mandate Phase 0 (C-44), Phase 3 bilateral echo (new), NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION with row citations (new). Maximally reinforced; most likely to surface C-45/C-46 if new criteria emerge. Expected: 36/36. |

---

## V-01 — Single-Axis: C-44 Bilateral Mandate Co-Declaration on V-04 Base

**Axis:** ROLE SEQUENCING MANDATE Phase 0 co-names SHALL-D-EXT-C35 and SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 as
explicit siblings — "two named sub-clauses declared with bilateral parity — SHALL-D-EXT-C35
(SE-side: SE-4 STRUCTURED CLOSE TABLE_4 row cross-reference, verified at CA-1.9) and
SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 (CS-side: CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED three-field Remediation, verified at CA-1.6)".
All other elements identical to R15-V-04 (inferred): labeled NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION block at
Phase 3, SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 sub-clause, A-N attestation cross-link mandate, CA-1.6 preamble-anchor
cites SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3.
**Hypothesis:** R15-V-04 satisfies C-40 (SHALL-F sub-clause), C-41 (attestation cross-link mandate),
C-42 (scope roster + standalone non-overlap element), C-43 (labeled NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION block).
The sole remaining gap is C-44. Adding the bilateral sibling declaration with SE-side/CS-side
qualifiers and verification row citations produces 36/36 (100.0).

## CONTEXT: MANUAL RBAC AUDIT BLIND SPOTS

Manual security reviews of Dataverse environments routinely miss three failure scenarios this trace
is designed to surface:

**Blind spot 1 — Post-incident FLS gap.** Column security profiles are rarely audited proactively.
Sensitive fields — credit limits, compensation data, SSNs, contact identifiers — remain readable
and writable by any role unless a column security profile explicitly restricts them. The security
roles UI does not surface which fields lack column security profiles; gaps are discovered after data
exposure, not before.

**Blind spot 2 — Cumulative privilege blind spot.** A user holding a BU-scoped security role who
also belongs to an owner team whose team role grants org-wide access has effective org-wide access.
No single Dataverse UI view surfaces the combined effective access produced by role + team + OWD
combination. Spot-checking individual roles misses cross-role accumulation through team membership.

**Blind spot 3 — OWD-sharing-rule override gap.** Administrators check OWD settings
entity-by-entity without evaluating the sharing rules that silently override those baselines. A
Private OWD on Case combined with a Power Automate-triggered sharing rule grants effective
org-wide read to users who satisfy the trigger condition — including low-trust service accounts
not intended to have broad case access.

CONTEXT BLIND SPOTS (input-level uncertainty):

| Label | Description | Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| BS-U1 | Field inventory not described — sensitive fields per entity must be inferred from typical Dataverse deployments for {{topic}} | High |
| BS-U2 | Sharing rule list not provided — zero vs. multiple active rules cannot be determined without environment inspection | High |
| BS-U3 | Team structure not specified — owner vs. access teams and their membership control mechanism assumed from feature context | Medium |

## ROLE SEQUENCING MANDATE

This output executes in four explicitly labeled phases. Phase labels MUST appear as structural
section headers in the output body. Each phase completes fully before the next begins.
Execution order is self-attestable from phase labels alone.

**PHASE 0 — CA (Compliance Auditor):** CA executes first. Authors Schema Registry (Step 0.1:
seven table schemas declared centrally) and Criterion Enforcement Matrix preamble (Step 0.2:
SHALL obligations including two named sub-clauses declared with bilateral parity —
SHALL-D-EXT-C35 (SE-side: SE-4 STRUCTURED CLOSE TABLE_4 row cross-reference, verified at CA-1.9)
and SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 (CS-side: CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED three-field Remediation, verified at
CA-1.6) — CEM four-column mapping, STRUCTURAL AXIS NON-INTERFERENCE DECLARATION with
A-1/A-2/A-3 labeled rows and attestation cross-link mandate, M4 pre-assignments CA-1.1 through
CA-1.9). CA issues handoff to PHASE 1 — SE.

**PHASE 1 — SE (Security Engineer / Dataverse Security Expert):** Executes second. Opens with
SE-0 (TABLE_4 escalation vectors before TABLE_1). Populates TABLE_1 through TABLE_5 using
Dataverse-native terminology. SE-2, SE-3, SE-4 each open with exact-label two-part closure block
per SHALL-G. SE-4 STRUCTURED CLOSE carries TABLE_4 row cross-reference per SHALL-D-EXT-C35.
SE populates SE-updatable columns in CS-2 and CS-3. Handoff to PHASE 2 — CS.

**PHASE 2 — CS (Customer Success):** Executes third. Opens with CS-0 (Schema Registry ID
citations for CS-2 and CS-3 before CS-1). Produces CS-1 qualitative baseline and expectation
tables CS-2 and CS-3 per SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3. Handoff to PHASE 3 — CA-1.

**PHASE 3 — CA-1 (CA Verification Pass):** CA returns. Phase 3 mandate carries complete CA-1.N
audit-target scope roster followed by labeled NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION block. Each CA-1 row
performs double-anchor reaffirmation (Registry anchor labeled, Preamble anchor labeled,
Verification statement following both). CA-1.6 cites SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3. CA-1.9 audits SE-4
STRUCTURED CLOSE TABLE_4 row cross-reference per SHALL-D-EXT-C35 — distinct from CA-1.4
(SE-0 ordering) and CA-1.7 (MANUAL GAP labels). Terminal verdict includes TRI-DIMENSIONAL
SELF-EVIDENCE ATTESTATION with A-N axis labels per attestation cross-link mandate.

---

## PHASE 0 — CA: SCHEMA REGISTRY AND ENFORCEMENT PREAMBLE

*CA executes Steps 0.1 and 0.2 before any other phase begins.*

### Step 0.1 — Schema Registry (CA-authored, Phase 0)

All table schemas declared centrally by CA. Blank-cell prohibition is global — individual tables
do not restate it. SE-update protocols for CS-2 and CS-3 declared co-located with schema entry.

**Schema ID: TABLE_1 — Role-Operation Matrix**
Declared columns: `Role | Tier | Create | Read | Write | Delete | Append | AppendTo | Assign | Share | Record Scope`
Tier values: Admin / Custom / Restricted. Rows ordered Admin first, Custom second, Restricted last.
Blank-cell rule: every cell MUST carry Granted / Denied / Conditional (condition inline) / N/A.

**Schema ID: TABLE_2 — FLS Coverage**
Declared columns: `Entity | Field | Category | FLS Profile Configured? | Roles: Read | Roles: Write | Gap?`
Blank-cell rule: FLS Profile Configured? = Configured / Not Configured. Gap? = YES / NO.

**Schema ID: TABLE_3 — Record Scope by Role**
Declared columns: `Role | Tier | OWD Baseline | Scope Modifier | Effective Scope | Verified?`
Effective Scope values: Own / BU / Parent-Child BU / Org-wide / Team-scoped / Sharing-[rule name].

**Schema ID: TABLE_4 — Escalation Vector Inventory**
Declared columns: `Vector | Checked? | Finding | Severity`
All four vectors (team inheritance / sharing rules / impersonation / admin-env-role) MUST appear.
Checked? = YES for all. Finding = escalation path or specific rule-out (never blank).
Note: TABLE_4 fills at SE-0, BEFORE TABLE_1 — the privilege ceiling is established first.

**Schema ID: TABLE_5 — Security Gap Inventory**
Declared columns: `# | Gap Type | Entity | Field or Rule | Role | Tier | Severity | Remediation`
Remediation = exact configuration object + exact path + expected post-fix state. Generic text fails.
CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED Remediation: three-field block (CS-Expected / SE-Actual / Delta).

**Schema ID: CS-2 — Sharing Rule Expectations**
Declared columns: `Rule Name | Trigger | Expected Access Granted | Intended for CS Role? | Potential Overreach? | SE Cross-Reference | SE Confirmation`
SE-updatable: SE Cross-Reference (TABLE_4 row ID), SE Confirmation (CONFIRMED / CONTRADICTED / NOT-APPLICABLE).
SE update protocol: populate after TABLE_4 at SE-0. CONTRADICTED triggers CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED per SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3.

**Schema ID: CS-3 — Cross-Role Access Differential Expectations**
Declared columns: `Entity | Operation | CS Role Expected Access | Comparison Role | Comparison Expected Access | Expected Differential | SE Cross-Reference | SE Confirmation`
SE-updatable: SE Cross-Reference (TABLE_1 or TABLE_3 row ID), SE Confirmation.
SE update protocol: populate after TABLE_1 and TABLE_3 analysis. CONTRADICTED triggers CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED per SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3.

### Step 0.2 — Criterion Enforcement Matrix Preamble (CA-authored, Phase 0)

**Declared rule: M1, M2, M3, M4 are simultaneously active — not alternative coverage paths. M4
CA verification row IDs pre-assigned by CA constitute pre-existing contract obligations fulfilled
as structural completions in Phase 3.**

| Criterion | M1: Format Schema | M2: Role Sub-Section | M3: SHALL Obligation | M4: CA Verification Row |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| C-01 | TABLE_1 | SE-1 | SHALL-A | CA-1.1 |
| C-02 | TABLE_2 | SE-2 | SHALL-B | CA-1.2 |
| C-03 | TABLE_3 | SE-1 + SE-3 | SHALL-C | CA-1.3 |
| C-04 | TABLE_4 | SE-0 + SE-4 | SHALL-D | CA-1.4 |
| C-05 | TABLE_5 | SE-5 | SHALL-E | CA-1.5 |

**SHALL obligations (authored by CA, Phase 0):**

- SHALL-A: A complete TABLE_1 MUST be present. Every cell carries Granted / Denied / Conditional / N/A. Every role with any privilege on any entity in {{topic}} MUST appear, ordered by Tier.
- SHALL-B: TABLE_2 MUST list every field containing PII, Financial, or Audit-Compliance data with explicit FLS status. Null case MUST be explicitly stated with field list. All Gap? YES rows MUST appear in TABLE_5.
- SHALL-C: Every TABLE_1 role MUST appear in TABLE_3 with a filled Effective Scope. Ambiguous scope MUST appear in TABLE_5.
- SHALL-D: TABLE_4 MUST contain all four escalation vectors with Checked? = YES. A rule-out requires naming the specific mechanism and a specific reason no path exists. TABLE_4 fills at SE-0 before TABLE_1. SHALL-D extension sub-clause SHALL-D-EXT-C35: SE-4's STRUCTURED CLOSE block MUST contain a verbatim TABLE_4 row cross-reference in the format "Cite: TABLE_4 (filled at SE-0) row [ID] — [role] privilege ceiling: [pattern]". CA-1.9 verifies this sub-clause as a distinct audit target from CA-1.4.
- SHALL-E: TABLE_5 MUST contain at least one gap row with a named field, role, or rule. Zero gaps requires explicit evidence rows confirming what was checked.
- SHALL-F: When any CS-2 or CS-3 expectation conflicts with an SE finding, the conflict MUST be recorded in TABLE_5 as gap type CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED. SHALL-F extension sub-clause SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3: Each CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED row MUST carry all three Remediation fields — CS-Expected (citing the CS-2 or CS-3 row by ID), SE-Actual (the diverging SE finding), and Delta (exact configuration change to align SE-Actual to CS-Expected). A row missing any field MUST be reopened. CA-1.6 verifies this sub-clause; CA-1.6's preamble-anchor paragraph cites SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 as the obligation it completes.
- SHALL-G: Each SE sub-section SE-2, SE-3, SE-4 opens with a two-part exact-label closure block. Line 1: `MANUAL GAP [<exact CONTEXT label>]:` where the label is character-for-character from the CONTEXT section (e.g., "Blind spot 1 — Post-incident FLS gap"). Line 2: description of what manual audits miss. Line 3: `STRUCTURED CLOSE:`. Line 4: which table closes the gap. Paraphrase or abbreviation of the CONTEXT label fails. CA-1.7 verifies exact labels.

**STRUCTURAL AXIS NON-INTERFERENCE DECLARATION**

The three R12 structural dimensions are orthogonal obligations. Each is independently mandated.

| Axis | Dimension | Criterion | Self-Evidence Mechanism |
|------|-----------|-----------|------------------------|
| A-1 | Execution order | C-31 | TABLE_4 fills at SE-0 section header, which precedes SE-1 in output body |
| A-2 | Closure-note format | C-32 | MANUAL GAP / STRUCTURED CLOSE exact labels at SE-2, SE-3, SE-4 openings |
| A-3 | CS self-reference | C-33 | CS-0 cites Schema Registry IDs for CS-2 and CS-3 before CS-1 content |

Non-interference rule: satisfying A-1 does not justify relaxing A-2 or A-3. These are independently
mandated obligations with distinct enforcement mechanisms and distinct CA-1.N verification rows.

**Attestation cross-link mandate:** The TRI-DIMENSIONAL SELF-EVIDENCE ATTESTATION block in the
CA Format Compliance Verdict (Phase 3) MUST identify each R12 dimension by its axis label as
declared in this table (A-1, A-2, A-3). Attestation rows that identify dimensions only by
criterion number (C-31, C-32, C-33) or descriptive phrase without citing the corresponding A-N
axis label from this declaration VIOLATE the cross-link mandate and fail C-37.

*Handing to PHASE 1 — SE.*

---

## PHASE 1 — SE: Security Analysis

*SE uses Dataverse-native terminology throughout. Execution begins at SE-0.*

### SE-0 / SHALL-D — Escalation Vector Inventory (executes BEFORE SE-1)

TABLE_4 fills here, establishing the privilege ceiling before any TABLE_1 cell is populated.
SE-0 is an explicitly labeled sub-step. Handoff to SE-1 follows SE-0 completion.

**TABLE_4 — Escalation Vector Inventory** *(Schema Registry TABLE_4; all four vectors required)*

| Vector | Checked? | Finding | Severity |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|
| Team inheritance | YES | | |
| Sharing rules | YES | | |
| Impersonation (Act on Behalf Of) | YES | | |
| Admin / environment role override | YES | | |

Finding format for confirmed escalation: `[Role] → [Mechanism: specific privilege name] → [Elevated access achieved]`
Finding format for rule-out: "Checked [mechanism]: no path because [specific reason naming the exact configuration examined]."

After TABLE_4: populate SE Cross-Reference and SE Confirmation in CS-2 rows. CONTRADICTED entries
trigger CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED in TABLE_5 per SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3.

*SE-0 complete — handing to SE-1.*

### SE-1 / SHALL-A — Role-Operation Matrix

**TABLE_1 — Role-Operation Matrix** *(Schema Registry TABLE_1; Tier column required; blank-cell rule global)*

| Role | Tier | Create | Read | Write | Delete | Append | AppendTo | Assign | Share | Record Scope |
|------|------|--------|------|-------|--------|--------|----------|--------|-------|--------------|

Include every role with any privilege on any entity in {{topic}}. Cross-reference CS-3's expected
access differential after the table — note rows that confirm CS expectations (with CS-3 row
reference) and rows that contradict (triggers CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED in TABLE_5 per SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3).

**Cross-role differential analysis:** Compare the CS role against at least one more privileged role
for the same entity and operation. State whether the differential is expected (least privilege
satisfied) or anomalous, and why.

### SE-2 / SHALL-B — Field-Level Security Coverage

MANUAL GAP [Blind spot 1 — Post-incident FLS gap]:
Column security profiles are not discoverable from the security roles UI; administrators learn of
missing FLS only after a data exposure reveals that a sensitive field was readable by an unintended role.

STRUCTURED CLOSE:
TABLE_2 below enumerates every sensitive field in scope with explicit FLS status, surfacing pre-event
what the security roles UI conceals. All Not Configured sensitive fields forward to TABLE_5 as MISSING-FLS.

**TABLE_2 — FLS Coverage** *(Schema Registry TABLE_2; blank-cell rule global)*

| Entity | Field | Category | FLS Profile Configured? | Roles: Read | Roles: Write | Gap? |
|--------|-------|----------|------------------------|-------------|--------------|------|

Categories: PII / Financial / Audit-Compliance / Other-Sensitive.
Null case: "No column security profiles active on {{topic}}. Sensitive fields identified: [list]. All entered in TABLE_5 as MISSING-FLS."
Forward all Gap? YES rows to TABLE_5.

**Defense-in-depth layer check:** For at least one sensitive field, identify the enforcement layer
(1: environment/admin role, 2: security role + BU scope, 3: team membership, 4: column security
profile) where read or write access is effectively granted or denied. Explain why the layer above
does not override.

### SE-3 / SHALL-C — Record Access Scope

MANUAL GAP [Blind spot 2 — Cumulative privilege blind spot]:
No single Dataverse UI view surfaces the combined effective access produced by a security role plus
owner team membership plus OWD settings; spot-checking roles individually misses team-accumulated
privilege escalation.

STRUCTURED CLOSE:
TABLE_3 below maps effective scope for every role by recording the OWD baseline, the scope modifier
from team or role depth, and the resulting effective scope as a single traceable row, making
team-accumulated privilege visible in one place.

**TABLE_3 — Record Scope by Role** *(Schema Registry TABLE_3; blank-cell rule global)*

| Role | Tier | OWD Baseline | Scope Modifier | Effective Scope | Verified? |
|------|------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|

Every TABLE_1 role MUST appear. Scope Modifier: privilege depth, owner team membership, access
team, or sharing rule that changes the OWD baseline. Note any role where effective scope exceeds
role-only scope due to team membership — this is a CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED candidate.

After TABLE_3: populate SE Cross-Reference and SE Confirmation in CS-3 rows. CONTRADICTED entries
trigger CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED in TABLE_5 per SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3.

### SE-4 / SHALL-D — Privilege Escalation Analysis

MANUAL GAP [Blind spot 3 — OWD-sharing-rule override gap]:
Administrators audit OWD settings entity-by-entity without cross-referencing sharing rules that
silently override them; a Private OWD combined with an active sharing rule grants effective
org-wide access without appearing in any security roles UI view.

STRUCTURED CLOSE:
TABLE_4 (filled at SE-0) surfaced escalation vectors before TABLE_1 was populated, establishing
the privilege ceiling first. CS-2 sharing rule expectations are confirmed or contradicted by SE
Cross-Reference and SE Confirmation columns after TABLE_4 analysis at SE-0.

[Cross-reference TABLE_4 (filled at SE-0). State: for each vector with a confirmed escalation
path, trace the path to its terminal access level. For each rule-out, confirm the specific control
that prevents the path at SE-0.]

After full escalation analysis:

MANUAL GAP close for SE-4 — TABLE_4 row cross-reference (SHALL-D-EXT-C35):

Cite: TABLE_4 (filled at SE-0) row [ID] — [role] privilege ceiling: [pattern]

This citation anchors the SE-4 STRUCTURED CLOSE to the specific TABLE_4 row established at SE-0.

### SE-5 / SHALL-E — Security Gap Inventory

**TABLE_5 — Security Gap Inventory** *(Schema Registry TABLE_5; blank-cell rule global)*

| # | Gap Type | Entity | Field or Rule | Role | Tier | Severity | Remediation |
|---|----------|--------|---------------|------|------|----------|-------------|

Gap Types: MISSING-FLS / ESCALATION-PATH / SHARING-CONFLICT / TEAM-GAP / OVER-PERMISSIONED / CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED.
Severity: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM.

Remediation specificity: name the exact object, exact path (Power Platform Admin Center location),
and expected post-fix state.

CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED rows (three-field Remediation block per SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3):
- CS-Expected: [cite CS-2 or CS-3 row by ID, state expectation verbatim or by row reference]
- SE-Actual: [SE finding that contradicts the expectation]
- Delta: [exact configuration change to align SE-Actual to CS-Expected]

*Handing to PHASE 2 — CS.*

---

## PHASE 2 — CS: Customer Success Analysis

*CS opens with CS-0. CS uses Schema Registry schemas for CS-2 and CS-3.*

### CS-0 — Schema Registry Acknowledgment (executes before CS-1)

Before producing any analysis content, CS cites the Schema Registry entries for CS-2 and CS-3 by
exact Schema ID label and lists the SE-updatable columns for each:

- Schema ID: CS-2 — Sharing Rule Expectations. SE-updatable columns: SE Cross-Reference (TABLE_4 row ID), SE Confirmation (CONFIRMED / CONTRADICTED / NOT-APPLICABLE). SE populates after TABLE_4 at SE-0.
- Schema ID: CS-3 — Cross-Role Access Differential Expectations. SE-updatable columns: SE Cross-Reference (TABLE_1 or TABLE_3 row ID), SE Confirmation. SE populates after TABLE_1/TABLE_3 analysis.

CS-0 confirms these Registry IDs govern the CS-2 and CS-3 tables below.

*CS-0 complete — proceeding to CS-1.*

### CS-1 — Qualitative Baseline

For each entity in {{topic}} scope:

(a) Which CRUD operations is the CS role expected to perform as part of normal job function?
(b) What is the expected record scope (own records / BU-wide / org-wide / team-scoped)?
(c) Which sensitive fields does CS need read or write access to, and why?
(d) Which configuration does CS rely on that may inadvertently open access beyond job requirements?

Name the business process at stake, at least two affected personas, and the expected access pattern
per persona. CS-1 findings are the expectation anchor for CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED gap type.

### CS-2 — Sharing Rule Expectations *(SE will populate SE Cross-Reference and SE Confirmation)*

| Rule Name | Trigger | Expected Access Granted | Intended for CS Role? | Potential Overreach? | SE Cross-Reference | SE Confirmation |
|-----------|---------|------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------|

For each Potential Overreach? YES: name the access path and the role most likely to be over-reached.

### CS-3 — Cross-Role Access Differential Expectations *(SE will populate SE Cross-Reference and SE Confirmation)*

| Entity | Operation | CS Role Expected Access | Comparison Role | Comparison Expected Access | Expected Differential | SE Cross-Reference | SE Confirmation |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------|

State at minimum one entity and one operation where CS should have less access than the Comparison Role.

*Handing to PHASE 3 — CA-1.*

## PHASE 3 — CA-1: Double-Anchor Format Compliance Verification

*CA returns. Phase 3 CA-1.N audit-target scope roster:*

| CA Row | Audit Target | Criterion | Non-Overlapping Scope |
|--------|-------------|-----------|----------------------|
| CA-1.1 | TABLE_1 completeness | C-01 | Role-operation matrix cell coverage and role enumeration |
| CA-1.2 | TABLE_2 FLS coverage | C-02 | Sensitive field FLS status and null-case declaration |
| CA-1.3 | TABLE_3 record scope | C-03 | Effective scope completeness for every TABLE_1 role |
| CA-1.4 | TABLE_4 SE-0 ordering | C-04 | SE-0 execution before SE-1 in output body; all four vectors present |
| CA-1.5 | TABLE_5 gap inventory | C-05 | Named gap with specific field/role/rule; remediation object/path/state |
| CA-1.6 | SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 three-field structure | SHALL-F | CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED row completeness — CS-Expected/SE-Actual/Delta — only |
| CA-1.7 | MANUAL GAP exact labels | SHALL-G | Character-for-character CONTEXT label carry-through at SE-2, SE-3, SE-4 only |
| CA-1.8 | CS-0 Registry citation | C-33 | CS-0 presence before CS-1; Schema ID labels cited by exact string |
| CA-1.9 | SE-4 STRUCTURED CLOSE TABLE_4 cross-reference | SHALL-D-EXT-C35 | Verbatim TABLE_4 row reference in SE-4 close only — distinct from CA-1.4 and CA-1.7 |

NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION:
CA-1.4 audits exclusively SE-0 ordering and four-vector presence. CA-1.7 audits exclusively
character-for-character MANUAL GAP label match. CA-1.9 audits exclusively the verbatim TABLE_4
row cross-reference in SE-4's STRUCTURED CLOSE. These three verification rows address
non-overlapping structural properties; no finding at CA-1.4 or CA-1.7 constitutes a finding at
CA-1.9, and vice versa.

Each CA-1 row MUST present Registry anchor and Preamble anchor as structurally distinct labeled
paragraphs before the Verification paragraph. Inline concatenation of anchors into a single string
fails C-24.

**CA-1.1 — C-01 verification** *(completing Phase 0 M4 pre-assignment CA-1.1)*:

Registry anchor — Schema ID TABLE_1: [Role, Tier, Create, Read, Write, Delete, Append, AppendTo, Assign, Share, Record Scope] — blank cells prohibited globally; Tier ordered Admin/Custom/Restricted.

Preamble anchor — C-01 as authored by CA in Phase 0: TABLE_1 / SE-1 / SHALL-A / CA-1.1 — verifying...

Verification — TABLE_1 present? Every cell Granted/Denied/Conditional/N/A? All roles with any privilege included? Tier column populated and ordered? → PASS / FAIL

**CA-1.2 — C-02 verification** *(completing Phase 0 M4 pre-assignment CA-1.2)*:

Registry anchor — Schema ID TABLE_2: [Entity, Field, Category, FLS Profile Configured?, Roles: Read, Roles: Write, Gap?] — blank cells prohibited globally.

Preamble anchor — C-02 as authored by CA in Phase 0: TABLE_2 / SE-2 / SHALL-B / CA-1.2 — verifying...

Verification — TABLE_2 present? Every sensitive field with explicit FLS status? Null case stated with field list? Gap? YES rows in TABLE_5? → PASS / FAIL

**CA-1.3 — C-03 verification** *(completing Phase 0 M4 pre-assignment CA-1.3)*:

Registry anchor — Schema ID TABLE_3: [Role, Tier, OWD Baseline, Scope Modifier, Effective Scope, Verified?] — blank cells prohibited globally.

Preamble anchor — C-03 as authored by CA in Phase 0: TABLE_3 / SE-1+SE-3 / SHALL-C / CA-1.3 — verifying...

Verification — Every TABLE_1 role in TABLE_3? Effective Scope filled for all? Ambiguous scope in TABLE_5? → PASS / FAIL

**CA-1.4 — C-04 verification** *(completing Phase 0 M4 pre-assignment CA-1.4)*:

Registry anchor — Schema ID TABLE_4: [Vector, Checked?, Finding, Severity] — all four vectors required; Checked? = YES; TABLE_4 fills at SE-0 before TABLE_1 per Registry note.

Preamble anchor — C-04 as authored by CA in Phase 0: TABLE_4 / SE-0+SE-4 / SHALL-D / CA-1.4 — verifying SE-0 ordering only; SE-4 cross-reference verified at CA-1.9...

Verification — TABLE_4 present? All four vectors with Checked? = YES? Each with finding or specific rule-out? TABLE_4 precedes TABLE_1 in output body (SE-0 before SE-1)? → PASS / FAIL

**CA-1.5 — C-05 verification** *(completing Phase 0 M4 pre-assignment CA-1.5)*:

Registry anchor — Schema ID TABLE_5: [#, Gap Type, Entity, Field or Rule, Role, Tier, Severity, Remediation] — blank cells prohibited globally.

Preamble anchor — C-05 as authored by CA in Phase 0: TABLE_5 / SE-5 / SHALL-E / CA-1.5 — verifying...

Verification — TABLE_5 present? Named gap with specific field/role/rule? Remediations exact (object + path + post-fix state)? → PASS / FAIL

**CA-1.6 — SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 compliance verification** *(completing Phase 0 M4 pre-assignment CA-1.6)*:

Registry anchor — Schema ID TABLE_5 CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED row structure: [CS-Expected field citing CS-2/CS-3 row ID, SE-Actual field naming diverging SE finding, Delta field stating exact configuration change] — all three Remediation fields required per SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3; a row missing any field is structurally incomplete and MUST be reopened.

Preamble anchor — SHALL-F extended with sub-clause SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 as authored by CA in Phase 0: CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED rows MUST carry CS-Expected (CS-2/CS-3 row citation) / SE-Actual (diverging SE finding) / Delta (exact config change). CA-1.6 completes the pre-assigned M4 obligation for SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 — verifying...

Verification — For each CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED row in TABLE_5: CS-Expected populated with CS-2 or CS-3 row ID citation? SE-Actual populated with specific SE finding? Delta populated with exact configuration change? → PASS / FAIL per row.

**CA-1.7 — SHALL-G compliance verification** *(MANUAL GAP exact-label two-part blocks)*:

Registry anchor — CONTEXT section declared exact labels: "Blind spot 1 — Post-incident FLS gap" (SE-2 target), "Blind spot 2 — Cumulative privilege blind spot" (SE-3 target), "Blind spot 3 — OWD-sharing-rule override gap" (SE-4 target). SHALL-G requires two-part blocks: `MANUAL GAP [<exact label>]:` then `STRUCTURED CLOSE:`.

Preamble anchor — SHALL-G as authored by CA in Phase 0: Line 1 MUST begin `MANUAL GAP [<exact CONTEXT label>]:` — character-for-character match; paraphrase or abbreviation fails — verifying...

Verification — SE-2 opens with `MANUAL GAP [Blind spot 1 — Post-incident FLS gap]:`? SE-3 opens with `MANUAL GAP [Blind spot 2 — Cumulative privilege blind spot]:`? SE-4 opens with `MANUAL GAP [Blind spot 3 — OWD-sharing-rule override gap]:`? Each followed by `STRUCTURED CLOSE:`? → PASS / FAIL per section.

**CA-1.8 — CS-0 Registry acknowledgment precedes CS-1** *(C-33 verification)*:

Registry anchor — Schema Registry declares CS-2 and CS-3 with Schema IDs "CS-2 — Sharing Rule Expectations" and "CS-3 — Cross-Role Access Differential Expectations", each with SE-updatable column declarations.

Preamble anchor — C-33 requires CS role to open with CS-0 citing Schema Registry IDs for CS-2 and CS-3 by exact label before any CS-1 content. CA-1.8 verifies CS-0 precedes CS-1 — verifying...

Verification — SE-4 STRUCTURED CLOSE contains verbatim "Cite: TABLE_4 (filled at SE-0) row [ID]" format? Cross-reference names a specific TABLE_4 row ID and role privilege ceiling pattern? This cross-reference is structurally distinct from the SE-0 ordering check in CA-1.4 and the exact-label check in CA-1.7? → PASS / FAIL

## V-02 — Single-Axis: Phase 3 Bilateral Echo of Sub-Clause Verification Targets

**Axis:** Phase 3 ROLE SEQUENCING MANDATE description explicitly names CA-1.9 (SHALL-D-EXT-C35,
SE-side verification) and CA-1.6 (SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3, CS-side verification) as bilateral
verification siblings. Phase 0 mandate reverts to V-04 non-bilateral listing (names both
sub-clauses but without "(SE-side)" / "(CS-side)" qualifiers and without "bilateral parity"
declaration). Tests whether mandate-level bilateral naming at Phase 3 rather than Phase 0
independently satisfies C-44.
**Hypothesis:** C-44 specifies Phase 0 mandate as the co-declaration site. V-02 tests this
placement requirement by satisfying bilateral parity at Phase 3 only. Expected: 35/36 (fails C-44
if Phase 0 placement is mandatory; confirms Phase 0 placement requirement).

## ROLE SEQUENCING MANDATE (V-02)

This output executes in four explicitly labeled phases. Phase labels MUST appear as structural
section headers in the output body. Each phase completes fully before the next begins.
Execution order is self-attestable from phase labels alone.

**PHASE 0 — CA (Compliance Auditor):** CA executes first. Authors Schema Registry (Step 0.1:
seven table schemas declared centrally) and Criterion Enforcement Matrix preamble (Step 0.2:
SHALL obligations including SHALL-D-EXT-C35 and SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 named sub-clauses, CEM
four-column mapping, STRUCTURAL AXIS NON-INTERFERENCE DECLARATION with A-1/A-2/A-3 labeled
rows and attestation cross-link mandate, M4 pre-assignments CA-1.1 through CA-1.9). CA issues
handoff to PHASE 1 — SE.

**PHASE 1 — SE (Security Engineer / Dataverse Security Expert):** Executes second. Opens with
SE-0 (TABLE_4 escalation vectors before TABLE_1). Populates TABLE_1 through TABLE_5 using
Dataverse-native terminology. SE-2, SE-3, SE-4 each open with exact-label two-part closure block
per SHALL-G. SE-4 STRUCTURED CLOSE carries TABLE_4 row cross-reference per SHALL-D-EXT-C35.
SE populates SE-updatable columns in CS-2 and CS-3. Handoff to PHASE 2 — CS.

**PHASE 2 — CS (Customer Success):** Executes third. Opens with CS-0 (Schema Registry ID
citations for CS-2 and CS-3 before CS-1). Produces CS-1 qualitative baseline and expectation
tables CS-2 and CS-3 per SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3. Handoff to PHASE 3 — CA-1.

**PHASE 3 — CA-1 (CA Verification Pass):** CA returns. Phase 3 mandate carries complete CA-1.N
audit-target scope roster followed by labeled NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION block. Each CA-1 row
performs double-anchor reaffirmation. Bilateral verification sub-clause targets: CA-1.9 verifies
SHALL-D-EXT-C35 (SE-side sub-clause) and CA-1.6 verifies SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 (CS-side
sub-clause) as co-equal named verification obligations. CA-1.9 is distinct from CA-1.4 and
CA-1.7. Terminal verdict includes TRI-DIMENSIONAL SELF-EVIDENCE ATTESTATION with A-N axis labels
per attestation cross-link mandate.

## PHASE 3 — CA-1: Double-Anchor Format Compliance Verification (V-02)

*CA returns. Phase 3 CA-1.N audit-target scope roster (V-02 — NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION labeled block; Phase 3 mandate declares bilateral sub-clause verification targets):*

| CA Row | Audit Target | Criterion | Non-Overlapping Scope |
|--------|-------------|-----------|----------------------|
| CA-1.1 | TABLE_1 completeness | C-01 | Role-operation matrix cell coverage and role enumeration |
| CA-1.2 | TABLE_2 FLS coverage | C-02 | Sensitive field FLS status and null-case declaration |
| CA-1.3 | TABLE_3 record scope | C-03 | Effective scope completeness for every TABLE_1 role |
| CA-1.4 | TABLE_4 SE-0 ordering | C-04 | SE-0 execution before SE-1 in output body; all four vectors present |
| CA-1.5 | TABLE_5 gap inventory | C-05 | Named gap with specific field/role/rule; remediation object/path/state |
| CA-1.6 | SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 three-field structure | SHALL-F | CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED row completeness — CS-Expected/SE-Actual/Delta — only |
| CA-1.7 | MANUAL GAP exact labels | SHALL-G | Character-for-character CONTEXT label carry-through at SE-2, SE-3, SE-4 only |
| CA-1.8 | CS-0 Registry citation | C-33 | CS-0 presence before CS-1; Schema ID labels cited by exact string |
| CA-1.9 | SE-4 STRUCTURED CLOSE TABLE_4 cross-reference | SHALL-D-EXT-C35 | Verbatim TABLE_4 row reference in SE-4 close only — distinct from CA-1.4 and CA-1.7 |

NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION:
CA-1.4 audits exclusively SE-0 ordering and four-vector presence. CA-1.7 audits exclusively
character-for-character MANUAL GAP label match. CA-1.9 audits exclusively the verbatim TABLE_4
row cross-reference in SE-4's STRUCTURED CLOSE. These three verification rows address
non-overlapping structural properties; no finding at CA-1.4 or CA-1.7 constitutes a finding at
CA-1.9, and vice versa.

[CA-1.1 through CA-1.9 and TRI-DIMENSIONAL SELF-EVIDENCE ATTESTATION: identical to V-01]

---

## V-03 — Single-Axis: NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION with Explicit CA Row Cross-References

**Axis:** The labeled NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION block below the CA-1.N scope roster explicitly
cites the three CA row IDs it distinguishes — CA-1.4, CA-1.7, CA-1.9 — as parenthetical
row-ID citations within each non-overlap statement. Format mirrors how the STRUCTURAL AXIS
NON-INTERFERENCE DECLARATION uses A-N row labels as primary identifiers. On V-01 base (passes
C-44). PHASE 0 mandate is bilateral (C-44 present).
**Hypothesis:** C-43 may reward structural specificity inside the labeled block beyond the prose
statement C-42 requires. Citing CA-1.4, CA-1.7, CA-1.9 by ID within the non-overlap statements
tests whether row-citing precision constitutes an additional structural pattern. Expected: 36/36
or reveals a structural gap if row-citation specificity is independently criterion-generating.

| CA-1.8 | CS-0 Registry citation | C-33 | CS-0 presence before CS-1; Schema ID labels cited by exact string |
| CA-1.9 | SE-4 STRUCTURED CLOSE TABLE_4 cross-reference | SHALL-D-EXT-C35 | Verbatim TABLE_4 row reference in SE-4 close only — distinct from CA-1.4 and CA-1.7 |

NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION:
CA-1.4 [SE-0 ordering and four-vector presence] audits exclusively whether TABLE_4 precedes
TABLE_1 in the output body and whether all four vectors carry Checked? = YES.
CA-1.7 [MANUAL GAP exact-label match] audits exclusively whether the character-for-character
CONTEXT label appears at SE-2, SE-3, SE-4 — no overlap with structural ordering or row citations.
CA-1.9 [SE-4 STRUCTURED CLOSE verbatim row cross-reference] audits exclusively the "Cite:
TABLE_4 (filled at SE-0) row [ID]" verbatim format in SE-4's STRUCTURED CLOSE. A finding at
CA-1.4 (ordering failure) does not constitute a finding at CA-1.9 (citation format), and vice
versa. A finding at CA-1.7 (label mismatch) does not constitute a finding at CA-1.9, and vice
versa.

## V-04 — Combined: V-01 (C-44 Bilateral Mandate) + V-03 (NON-OVERLAP with CA Row Citations)

**Axis:** Two independent reinforcement axes: (V-01) bilateral sibling co-declaration in ROLE
SEQUENCING MANDATE Phase 0 with SE-side/CS-side labels (C-44 satisfied); (V-03) NON-OVERLAP
DECLARATION block with explicit CA-1.4 / CA-1.7 / CA-1.9 row-ID citations within each
non-overlap statement (C-43 structurally hardened).
**Hypothesis:** C-43 and C-44 are independently satisfied. The CA row citation specificity in the
NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION block and the mandate-level bilateral co-declaration operate on distinct
structural locations without interference. Expected: 36/36 — or reveals whether CA row-citing
specificity inside the labeled block generates a new structural criterion.

| CA-1.9 | SE-4 STRUCTURED CLOSE TABLE_4 cross-reference | SHALL-D-EXT-C35 | Verbatim TABLE_4 row reference in SE-4 close only — distinct from CA-1.4 and CA-1.7 |

NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION:
CA-1.4 [SE-0 ordering and four-vector presence] audits exclusively whether TABLE_4 precedes
TABLE_1 in the output body and whether all four vectors carry Checked? = YES.
CA-1.7 [MANUAL GAP exact-label match] audits exclusively whether the character-for-character
CONTEXT label appears at SE-2, SE-3, SE-4 — no overlap with structural ordering or row citations.
CA-1.9 [SE-4 STRUCTURED CLOSE verbatim row cross-reference] audits exclusively the "Cite:
TABLE_4 (filled at SE-0) row [ID]" verbatim format in SE-4's STRUCTURED CLOSE. A finding at
CA-1.4 (ordering failure) does not constitute a finding at CA-1.9 (citation format), and vice

## V-05 — Combined: V-01 + V-02 + V-03 on R15-V-04 Base (Definitive Compound Candidate)

**Axis:** All three reinforcement axes: (V-01) bilateral sibling co-declaration in Phase 0 ROLE
SEQUENCING MANDATE with SE-side/CS-side labels and verification row citations (C-44); (V-02)
Phase 3 mandate bilateral echo naming CA-1.9 and CA-1.6 as co-equal verification siblings
(new axis); (V-03) NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION block with explicit CA-1.4/CA-1.7/CA-1.9 row-ID
citations within the non-overlap statements (C-43 structural hardening).
**Hypothesis:** Three independent structural locations each declare bilateral parity: Phase 0
mandate (C-44), Phase 3 mandate description, and NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION block. No axis
interferes with another. C-43 and C-44 are maximally expressed. Expected: 36/36 (100.0) — and
most likely to expose C-45/C-46 structural patterns if the Phase 3 bilateral echo at the mandate
level constitutes an independent criterion.

## CONTEXT: MANUAL RBAC AUDIT BLIND SPOTS

Manual security reviews of Dataverse environments routinely miss three failure scenarios this trace
is designed to surface:

**Blind spot 1 — Post-incident FLS gap.** Column security profiles are rarely audited proactively.
Sensitive fields — credit limits, compensation data, SSNs, contact identifiers — remain readable
and writable by any role unless a column security profile explicitly restricts them. The security
roles UI does not surface which fields lack column security profiles; gaps are discovered after data
exposure, not before.

**Blind spot 2 — Cumulative privilege blind spot.** A user holding a BU-scoped security role who
also belongs to an owner team whose team role grants org-wide access has effective org-wide access.
No single Dataverse UI view surfaces the combined effective access produced by role + team + OWD
combination. Spot-checking individual roles misses cross-role accumulation through team membership.

**Blind spot 3 — OWD-sharing-rule override gap.** Administrators check OWD settings
entity-by-entity without evaluating the sharing rules that silently override those baselines. A
Private OWD on Case combined with a Power Automate-triggered sharing rule grants effective
org-wide read to users who satisfy the trigger condition — including low-trust service accounts
not intended to have broad case access.

CONTEXT BLIND SPOTS (input-level uncertainty):

| Label | Description | Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| BS-U1 | Field inventory not described — sensitive fields per entity must be inferred from typical Dataverse deployments for {{topic}} | High |
| BS-U2 | Sharing rule list not provided — zero vs. multiple active rules cannot be determined without environment inspection | High |
| BS-U3 | Team structure not specified — owner vs. access teams and their membership control mechanism assumed from feature context | Medium |

SHALL obligations including two named sub-clauses declared with bilateral parity —
SHALL-D-EXT-C35 (SE-side: SE-4 STRUCTURED CLOSE TABLE_4 row cross-reference, verified at CA-1.9)

## PHASE 0 — CA: SCHEMA REGISTRY AND ENFORCEMENT PREAMBLE (V-05)

*CA executes Steps 0.1 and 0.2 before any other phase begins.*

### Step 0.1 — Schema Registry (CA-authored, Phase 0)

All table schemas declared centrally by CA. Blank-cell prohibition is global — individual tables
do not restate it. SE-update protocols for CS-2 and CS-3 declared co-located with schema entry.

**Schema ID: TABLE_1 — Role-Operation Matrix**
Declared columns: `Role | Tier | Create | Read | Write | Delete | Append | AppendTo | Assign | Share | Record Scope`
Tier values: Admin / Custom / Restricted. Rows ordered Admin first, Custom second, Restricted last.
Blank-cell rule: every cell MUST carry Granted / Denied / Conditional (condition inline) / N/A.

**Schema ID: TABLE_2 — FLS Coverage**
Declared columns: `Entity | Field | Category | FLS Profile Configured? | Roles: Read | Roles: Write | Gap?`
Blank-cell rule: FLS Profile Configured? = Configured / Not Configured. Gap? = YES / NO.

**Schema ID: TABLE_3 — Record Scope by Role**
Declared columns: `Role | Tier | OWD Baseline | Scope Modifier | Effective Scope | Verified?`
Effective Scope values: Own / BU / Parent-Child BU / Org-wide / Team-scoped / Sharing-[rule name].

**Schema ID: TABLE_4 — Escalation Vector Inventory**
Declared columns: `Vector | Checked? | Finding | Severity`
All four vectors (team inheritance / sharing rules / impersonation / admin-env-role) MUST appear.
Checked? = YES for all. Finding = escalation path or specific rule-out (never blank).
Note: TABLE_4 fills at SE-0, BEFORE TABLE_1 — the privilege ceiling is established first.

**Schema ID: TABLE_5 — Security Gap Inventory**
Declared columns: `# | Gap Type | Entity | Field or Rule | Role | Tier | Severity | Remediation`
Remediation = exact configuration object + exact path + expected post-fix state. Generic text fails.
CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED Remediation: three-field block (CS-Expected / SE-Actual / Delta).

**Schema ID: CS-2 — Sharing Rule Expectations**
Declared columns: `Rule Name | Trigger | Expected Access Granted | Intended for CS Role? | Potential Overreach? | SE Cross-Reference | SE Confirmation`
SE-updatable: SE Cross-Reference (TABLE_4 row ID), SE Confirmation (CONFIRMED / CONTRADICTED / NOT-APPLICABLE).
SE update protocol: populate after TABLE_4 at SE-0. CONTRADICTED triggers CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED per SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3.

**Schema ID: CS-3 — Cross-Role Access Differential Expectations**
Declared columns: `Entity | Operation | CS Role Expected Access | Comparison Role | Comparison Expected Access | Expected Differential | SE Cross-Reference | SE Confirmation`
SE-updatable: SE Cross-Reference (TABLE_1 or TABLE_3 row ID), SE Confirmation.
SE update protocol: populate after TABLE_1 and TABLE_3 analysis. CONTRADICTED triggers CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED per SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3.

### Step 0.2 — Criterion Enforcement Matrix Preamble (CA-authored, Phase 0)

**Declared rule: M1, M2, M3, M4 are simultaneously active — not alternative coverage paths. M4
CA verification row IDs pre-assigned by CA constitute pre-existing contract obligations fulfilled
as structural completions in Phase 3.**

| Criterion | M1: Format Schema | M2: Role Sub-Section | M3: SHALL Obligation | M4: CA Verification Row |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| C-01 | TABLE_1 | SE-1 | SHALL-A | CA-1.1 |
| C-02 | TABLE_2 | SE-2 | SHALL-B | CA-1.2 |
| C-03 | TABLE_3 | SE-1 + SE-3 | SHALL-C | CA-1.3 |
| C-04 | TABLE_4 | SE-0 + SE-4 | SHALL-D | CA-1.4 |
| C-05 | TABLE_5 | SE-5 | SHALL-E | CA-1.5 |

**SHALL obligations (authored by CA, Phase 0):**

- SHALL-A: A complete TABLE_1 MUST be present. Every cell carries Granted / Denied / Conditional / N/A. Every role with any privilege on any entity in {{topic}} MUST appear, ordered by Tier.
- SHALL-B: TABLE_2 MUST list every field containing PII, Financial, or Audit-Compliance data with explicit FLS status. Null case MUST be explicitly stated with field list. All Gap? YES rows MUST appear in TABLE_5.
- SHALL-C: Every TABLE_1 role MUST appear in TABLE_3 with a filled Effective Scope. Ambiguous scope MUST appear in TABLE_5.
- SHALL-D: TABLE_4 MUST contain all four escalation vectors with Checked? = YES. A rule-out requires naming the specific mechanism and a specific reason no path exists. TABLE_4 fills at SE-0 before TABLE_1. SHALL-D extension sub-clause SHALL-D-EXT-C35: SE-4's STRUCTURED CLOSE block MUST contain a verbatim TABLE_4 row cross-reference in the format "Cite: TABLE_4 (filled at SE-0) row [ID] — [role] privilege ceiling: [pattern]". CA-1.9 verifies this sub-clause as a distinct audit target from CA-1.4.
- SHALL-E: TABLE_5 MUST contain at least one gap row with a named field, role, or rule. Zero gaps requires explicit evidence rows confirming what was checked.
- SHALL-F: When any CS-2 or CS-3 expectation conflicts with an SE finding, the conflict MUST be recorded in TABLE_5 as gap type CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED. SHALL-F extension sub-clause SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3: Each CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED row MUST carry all three Remediation fields — CS-Expected (citing the CS-2 or CS-3 row by ID), SE-Actual (the diverging SE finding), and Delta (exact configuration change to align SE-Actual to CS-Expected). A row missing any field MUST be reopened. CA-1.6 verifies this sub-clause; CA-1.6's preamble-anchor paragraph cites SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 as the obligation it completes.
- SHALL-G: Each SE sub-section SE-2, SE-3, SE-4 opens with a two-part exact-label closure block. Line 1: `MANUAL GAP [<exact CONTEXT label>]:` where the label is character-for-character from the CONTEXT section (e.g., "Blind spot 1 — Post-incident FLS gap"). Line 2: description of what manual audits miss. Line 3: `STRUCTURED CLOSE:`. Line 4: which table closes the gap. Paraphrase or abbreviation of the CONTEXT label fails. CA-1.7 verifies exact labels.

**STRUCTURAL AXIS NON-INTERFERENCE DECLARATION**

The three R12 structural dimensions are orthogonal obligations. Each is independently mandated.

| Axis | Dimension | Criterion | Self-Evidence Mechanism |
|------|-----------|-----------|------------------------|
| A-1 | Execution order | C-31 | TABLE_4 fills at SE-0 section header, which precedes SE-1 in output body |
| A-2 | Closure-note format | C-32 | MANUAL GAP / STRUCTURED CLOSE exact labels at SE-2, SE-3, SE-4 openings |
| A-3 | CS self-reference | C-33 | CS-0 cites Schema Registry IDs for CS-2 and CS-3 before CS-1 content |

Non-interference rule: satisfying A-1 does not justify relaxing A-2 or A-3. These are independently
mandated obligations with distinct enforcement mechanisms and distinct CA-1.N verification rows.

**Attestation cross-link mandate:** The TRI-DIMENSIONAL SELF-EVIDENCE ATTESTATION block in the
CA Format Compliance Verdict (Phase 3) MUST identify each R12 dimension by its axis label as
declared in this table (A-1, A-2, A-3). Attestation rows that identify dimensions only by
criterion number (C-31, C-32, C-33) or descriptive phrase without citing the corresponding A-N
axis label from this declaration VIOLATE the cross-link mandate and fail C-37.

*Handing to PHASE 1 — SE.*

## PHASE 1 — SE: Security Analysis (V-05)

*SE uses Dataverse-native terminology throughout. Execution begins at SE-0.*

### SE-0 / SHALL-D — Escalation Vector Inventory (executes BEFORE SE-1)

TABLE_4 fills here, establishing the privilege ceiling before any TABLE_1 cell is populated.
SE-0 is an explicitly labeled sub-step. Handoff to SE-1 follows SE-0 completion.

**TABLE_4 — Escalation Vector Inventory** *(Schema Registry TABLE_4; all four vectors required)*

| Vector | Checked? | Finding | Severity |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|
| Team inheritance | YES | | |
| Sharing rules | YES | | |
| Impersonation (Act on Behalf Of) | YES | | |
| Admin / environment role override | YES | | |

Finding format for confirmed escalation: `[Role] → [Mechanism: specific privilege name] → [Elevated access achieved]`
Finding format for rule-out: "Checked [mechanism]: no path because [specific reason naming the exact configuration examined]."

After TABLE_4: populate SE Cross-Reference and SE Confirmation in CS-2 rows. CONTRADICTED entries
trigger CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED in TABLE_5 per SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3.

*SE-0 complete — handing to SE-1.*

### SE-1 / SHALL-A — Role-Operation Matrix

**TABLE_1 — Role-Operation Matrix** *(Schema Registry TABLE_1; Tier column required; blank-cell rule global)*

| Role | Tier | Create | Read | Write | Delete | Append | AppendTo | Assign | Share | Record Scope |
|------|------|--------|------|-------|--------|--------|----------|--------|-------|--------------|

Include every role with any privilege on any entity in {{topic}}. Cross-reference CS-3's expected
access differential after the table — note rows that confirm CS expectations (with CS-3 row
reference) and rows that contradict (triggers CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED in TABLE_5 per SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3).

**Cross-role differential analysis:** Compare the CS role against at least one more privileged role
for the same entity and operation. State whether the differential is expected (least privilege
satisfied) or anomalous, and why.

### SE-2 / SHALL-B — Field-Level Security Coverage

MANUAL GAP [Blind spot 1 — Post-incident FLS gap]:
Column security profiles are not discoverable from the security roles UI; administrators learn of
missing FLS only after a data exposure reveals that a sensitive field was readable by an unintended role.

STRUCTURED CLOSE:
TABLE_2 below enumerates every sensitive field in scope with explicit FLS status, surfacing pre-event
what the security roles UI conceals. All Not Configured sensitive fields forward to TABLE_5 as MISSING-FLS.

**TABLE_2 — FLS Coverage** *(Schema Registry TABLE_2; blank-cell rule global)*

| Entity | Field | Category | FLS Profile Configured? | Roles: Read | Roles: Write | Gap? |
|--------|-------|----------|------------------------|-------------|--------------|------|

Categories: PII / Financial / Audit-Compliance / Other-Sensitive.
Null case: "No column security profiles active on {{topic}}. Sensitive fields identified: [list]. All entered in TABLE_5 as MISSING-FLS."
Forward all Gap? YES rows to TABLE_5.

**Defense-in-depth layer check:** For at least one sensitive field, identify the enforcement layer
(1: environment/admin role, 2: security role + BU scope, 3: team membership, 4: column security
profile) where read or write access is effectively granted or denied. Explain why the layer above
does not override.

### SE-3 / SHALL-C — Record Access Scope

MANUAL GAP [Blind spot 2 — Cumulative privilege blind spot]:
No single Dataverse UI view surfaces the combined effective access produced by a security role plus
owner team membership plus OWD settings; spot-checking roles individually misses team-accumulated
privilege escalation.

STRUCTURED CLOSE:
TABLE_3 below maps effective scope for every role by recording the OWD baseline, the scope modifier
from team or role depth, and the resulting effective scope as a single traceable row, making
team-accumulated privilege visible in one place.

**TABLE_3 — Record Scope by Role** *(Schema Registry TABLE_3; blank-cell rule global)*

| Role | Tier | OWD Baseline | Scope Modifier | Effective Scope | Verified? |
|------|------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|

Every TABLE_1 role MUST appear. Scope Modifier: privilege depth, owner team membership, access
team, or sharing rule that changes the OWD baseline. Note any role where effective scope exceeds
role-only scope due to team membership — this is a CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED candidate.

After TABLE_3: populate SE Cross-Reference and SE Confirmation in CS-3 rows. CONTRADICTED entries
trigger CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED in TABLE_5 per SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3.

### SE-4 / SHALL-D — Privilege Escalation Analysis

MANUAL GAP [Blind spot 3 — OWD-sharing-rule override gap]:
Administrators audit OWD settings entity-by-entity without cross-referencing sharing rules that
silently override them; a Private OWD combined with an active sharing rule grants effective
org-wide access without appearing in any security roles UI view.

STRUCTURED CLOSE:
TABLE_4 (filled at SE-0) surfaced escalation vectors before TABLE_1 was populated, establishing
the privilege ceiling first. CS-2 sharing rule expectations are confirmed or contradicted by SE
Cross-Reference and SE Confirmation columns after TABLE_4 analysis at SE-0.

[Cross-reference TABLE_4 (filled at SE-0). State: for each vector with a confirmed escalation
path, trace the path to its terminal access level. For each rule-out, confirm the specific control
that prevents the path at SE-0.]

After full escalation analysis:

MANUAL GAP close for SE-4 — TABLE_4 row cross-reference (SHALL-D-EXT-C35):

Cite: TABLE_4 (filled at SE-0) row [ID] — [role] privilege ceiling: [pattern]

This citation anchors the SE-4 STRUCTURED CLOSE to the specific TABLE_4 row established at SE-0.

### SE-5 / SHALL-E — Security Gap Inventory

**TABLE_5 — Security Gap Inventory** *(Schema Registry TABLE_5; blank-cell rule global)*

| # | Gap Type | Entity | Field or Rule | Role | Tier | Severity | Remediation |
|---|----------|--------|---------------|------|------|----------|-------------|

Gap Types: MISSING-FLS / ESCALATION-PATH / SHARING-CONFLICT / TEAM-GAP / OVER-PERMISSIONED / CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED.
Severity: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM.

Remediation specificity: name the exact object, exact path (Power Platform Admin Center location),
and expected post-fix state.

CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED rows (three-field Remediation block per SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3):
- CS-Expected: [cite CS-2 or CS-3 row by ID, state expectation verbatim or by row reference]
- SE-Actual: [SE finding that contradicts the expectation]
- Delta: [exact configuration change to align SE-Actual to CS-Expected]

*Handing to PHASE 2 — CS.*

---

## PHASE 2 — CS: Customer Success Analysis (V-05)

*CS opens with CS-0. CS uses Schema Registry schemas for CS-2 and CS-3.*

### CS-0 — Schema Registry Acknowledgment (executes before CS-1)

Before producing any analysis content, CS cites the Schema Registry entries for CS-2 and CS-3 by
exact Schema ID label and lists the SE-updatable columns for each:

- Schema ID: CS-2 — Sharing Rule Expectations. SE-updatable columns: SE Cross-Reference (TABLE_4 row ID), SE Confirmation (CONFIRMED / CONTRADICTED / NOT-APPLICABLE). SE populates after TABLE_4 at SE-0.
- Schema ID: CS-3 — Cross-Role Access Differential Expectations. SE-updatable columns: SE Cross-Reference (TABLE_1 or TABLE_3 row ID), SE Confirmation. SE populates after TABLE_1/TABLE_3 analysis.

CS-0 confirms these Registry IDs govern the CS-2 and CS-3 tables below.

*CS-0 complete — proceeding to CS-1.*

### CS-1 — Qualitative Baseline

For each entity in {{topic}} scope:

(a) Which CRUD operations is the CS role expected to perform as part of normal job function?
(b) What is the expected record scope (own records / BU-wide / org-wide / team-scoped)?
(c) Which sensitive fields does CS need read or write access to, and why?
(d) Which configuration does CS rely on that may inadvertently open access beyond job requirements?

Name the business process at stake, at least two affected personas, and the expected access pattern
per persona. CS-1 findings are the expectation anchor for CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED gap type.

### CS-2 — Sharing Rule Expectations *(SE will populate SE Cross-Reference and SE Confirmation)*

| Rule Name | Trigger | Expected Access Granted | Intended for CS Role? | Potential Overreach? | SE Cross-Reference | SE Confirmation |
|-----------|---------|------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------|

For each Potential Overreach? YES: name the access path and the role most likely to be over-reached.

### CS-3 — Cross-Role Access Differential Expectations *(SE will populate SE Cross-Reference and SE Confirmation)*

| Entity | Operation | CS Role Expected Access | Comparison Role | Comparison Expected Access | Expected Differential | SE Cross-Reference | SE Confirmation |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------|

State at minimum one entity and one operation where CS should have less access than the Comparison Role.

*Handing to PHASE 3 — CA-1.*

## PHASE 3 — CA-1: Double-Anchor Format Compliance Verification (V-05)

*CA returns. Phase 3 CA-1.N audit-target scope roster:*

| CA Row | Audit Target | Criterion | Non-Overlapping Scope |
|--------|-------------|-----------|----------------------|
| CA-1.1 | TABLE_1 completeness | C-01 | Role-operation matrix cell coverage and role enumeration |
| CA-1.2 | TABLE_2 FLS coverage | C-02 | Sensitive field FLS status and null-case declaration |
| CA-1.3 | TABLE_3 record scope | C-03 | Effective scope completeness for every TABLE_1 role |
| CA-1.4 | TABLE_4 SE-0 ordering | C-04 | SE-0 execution before SE-1 in output body; all four vectors present |
| CA-1.5 | TABLE_5 gap inventory | C-05 | Named gap with specific field/role/rule; remediation object/path/state |
| CA-1.6 | SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 three-field structure | SHALL-F | CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED row completeness — CS-Expected/SE-Actual/Delta — only |
| CA-1.7 | MANUAL GAP exact labels | SHALL-G | Character-for-character CONTEXT label carry-through at SE-2, SE-3, SE-4 only |
| CA-1.8 | CS-0 Registry citation | C-33 | CS-0 presence before CS-1; Schema ID labels cited by exact string |
| CA-1.9 | SE-4 STRUCTURED CLOSE TABLE_4 cross-reference | SHALL-D-EXT-C35 | Verbatim TABLE_4 row reference in SE-4 close only — distinct from CA-1.4 and CA-1.7 |

NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION:
CA-1.4 [SE-0 ordering and four-vector presence] audits exclusively whether TABLE_4 precedes
TABLE_1 in the output body and whether all four vectors carry Checked? = YES.
CA-1.7 [MANUAL GAP exact-label match] audits exclusively whether the character-for-character
CONTEXT label appears at SE-2, SE-3, SE-4 — no overlap with structural ordering or row citations.
CA-1.9 [SE-4 STRUCTURED CLOSE verbatim row cross-reference] audits exclusively the "Cite:
TABLE_4 (filled at SE-0) row [ID]" verbatim format in SE-4's STRUCTURED CLOSE. A finding at
CA-1.4 (ordering failure) does not constitute a finding at CA-1.9 (citation format), and vice
versa. A finding at CA-1.7 (label mismatch) does not constitute a finding at CA-1.9, and vice
versa.

Each CA-1 row MUST present Registry anchor and Preamble anchor as structurally distinct labeled
paragraphs before the Verification paragraph. Inline concatenation of anchors into a single string
fails C-24.

**CA-1.1 — C-01 verification** *(completing Phase 0 M4 pre-assignment CA-1.1)*:

**CA-1.4 — C-04 verification** *(completing Phase 0 M4 pre-assignment CA-1.4)*:

Registry anchor — Schema ID TABLE_4: [Vector, Checked?, Finding, Severity] — all four vectors required; Checked? = YES; TABLE_4 fills at SE-0 before TABLE_1 per Registry note.

Preamble anchor — C-04 as authored by CA in Phase 0: TABLE_4 / SE-0+SE-4 / SHALL-D / CA-1.4 — verifying SE-0 ordering only; SE-4 cross-reference verified at CA-1.9...

Verification — TABLE_4 present? All four vectors with Checked? = YES? Each with finding or specific rule-out? TABLE_4 precedes TABLE_1 in output body (SE-0 before SE-1)? → PASS / FAIL

Registry anchor — Schema ID TABLE_5: [#, Gap Type, Entity, Field or Rule, Role, Tier, Severity, Remediation] — blank cells prohibited globally.

Preamble anchor — C-05 as authored by CA in Phase 0: TABLE_5 / SE-5 / SHALL-E / CA-1.5 — verifying...

Verification — TABLE_5 present? Named gap with specific field/role/rule? Remediations exact (object + path + post-fix state)? → PASS / FAIL

**CA-1.6 — SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 compliance verification** *(completing Phase 0 M4 pre-assignment CA-1.6)*:

Registry anchor — Schema ID TABLE_5 CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED row structure: [CS-Expected field citing CS-2/CS-3 row ID, SE-Actual field naming diverging SE finding, Delta field stating exact configuration change] — all three Remediation fields required per SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3; a row missing any field is structurally incomplete and MUST be reopened.

Preamble anchor — SHALL-F extended with sub-clause SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 as authored by CA in Phase 0: CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED rows MUST carry CS-Expected (CS-2/CS-3 row citation) / SE-Actual (diverging SE finding) / Delta (exact config change). CA-1.6 completes the pre-assigned M4 obligation for SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 — verifying...

Verification — For each CS-EXPECTATION-VIOLATED row in TABLE_5: CS-Expected populated with CS-2 or CS-3 row ID citation? SE-Actual populated with specific SE finding? Delta populated with exact configuration change? → PASS / FAIL per row.

**CA-1.7 — SHALL-G compliance verification** *(MANUAL GAP exact-label two-part blocks)*:

Registry anchor — CONTEXT section declared exact labels: "Blind spot 1 — Post-incident FLS gap" (SE-2 target), "Blind spot 2 — Cumulative privilege blind spot" (SE-3 target), "Blind spot 3 — OWD-sharing-rule override gap" (SE-4 target). SHALL-G requires two-part blocks: `MANUAL GAP [<exact label>]:` then `STRUCTURED CLOSE:`.

Preamble anchor — SHALL-G as authored by CA in Phase 0: Line 1 MUST begin `MANUAL GAP [<exact CONTEXT label>]:` — character-for-character match; paraphrase or abbreviation fails — verifying...

Verification — SE-2 opens with `MANUAL GAP [Blind spot 1 — Post-incident FLS gap]:`? SE-3 opens with `MANUAL GAP [Blind spot 2 — Cumulative privilege blind spot]:`? SE-4 opens with `MANUAL GAP [Blind spot 3 — OWD-sharing-rule override gap]:`? Each followed by `STRUCTURED CLOSE:`? → PASS / FAIL per section.

**CA-1.8 — CS-0 Registry acknowledgment precedes CS-1** *(C-33 verification)*:

Registry anchor — Schema Registry declares CS-2 and CS-3 with Schema IDs "CS-2 — Sharing Rule Expectations" and "CS-3 — Cross-Role Access Differential Expectations", each with SE-updatable column declarations.

Preamble anchor — C-33 requires CS role to open with CS-0 citing Schema Registry IDs for CS-2 and CS-3 by exact label before any CS-1 content. CA-1.8 verifies CS-0 precedes CS-1 — verifying...

Verification — CS-0 section present as explicitly labeled sub-step? CS-0 quotes Schema ID: CS-2 and Schema ID: CS-3 by exact label? CS-0 appears before CS-1 content begins? → PASS / FAIL

**CA-1.9 — SE-4 STRUCTURED CLOSE TABLE_4 row cross-reference** *(completing Phase 0 M4 pre-assignment CA-1.9 — SHALL-D-EXT-C35; distinct audit target from CA-1.4 and CA-1.7)*:

Registry anchor — Schema ID TABLE_4 (filled at SE-0): [Vector, Checked?, Finding, Severity]. SE-4 STRUCTURED CLOSE MUST contain verbatim cross-reference format: "Cite: TABLE_4 (filled at SE-0) row [ID] — [role] privilege ceiling: [pattern]". This is distinct from SE-0 ordering (CA-1.4) and MANUAL GAP labels (CA-1.7).

Preamble anchor — SHALL-D extended with sub-clause SHALL-D-EXT-C35 as authored by CA in Phase 0: SE-4's STRUCTURED CLOSE MUST contain verbatim TABLE_4 row cross-reference. CA-1.9 completes the pre-assigned M4 obligation for SHALL-D-EXT-C35 — verifying...

Verification — SE-4 STRUCTURED CLOSE contains verbatim "Cite: TABLE_4 (filled at SE-0) row [ID]" format? Cross-reference names a specific TABLE_4 row ID and role privilege ceiling pattern? This cross-reference is structurally distinct from the SE-0 ordering check in CA-1.4 and the exact-label check in CA-1.7? → PASS / FAIL

**CA Format Compliance Verdict (Phase 0 citation):**

Citing: CA-authored Schema Registry (Step 0.1, Phase 0), CA-authored preamble (Step 0.2, Phase 0),
Phase 0 label as structural basis.

[C-01 through C-05: CA-1.1–CA-1.5 results. SHALL-F-EXT-CS2CS3 three-field structure: CA-1.6 result. SHALL-G exact-label blocks: CA-1.7 result. CS-0 Registry acknowledgment: CA-1.8 result. SE-4 STRUCTURED CLOSE cross-reference: CA-1.9 result. Overall: COMPLIANT / NON-COMPLIANT. Open items attributed to responsible role.]

**TRI-DIMENSIONAL SELF-EVIDENCE ATTESTATION**

Each R12 structural dimension is independently verifiable from the output body without consulting
prompt instructions. Axis labels match the STRUCTURAL AXIS NON-INTERFERENCE DECLARATION in
Phase 0 Step 0.2 per attestation cross-link mandate.

| Axis | Dimension (Criterion) | Output-Body Evidence Source | Status |
|------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|--------|
| A-1 | Execution order (C-31) | PHASE 1 section header "SE-0 / SHALL-D — Escalation Vector Inventory (executes BEFORE SE-1)" appears before "SE-1 / SHALL-A"; TABLE_4 rows precede TABLE_1 rows in output body | CONFIRMED |
| A-2 | Closure-note format (C-32) | SE-2, SE-3, SE-4 each open with verbatim "MANUAL GAP [...]:" / "STRUCTURED CLOSE:" two-part block; labels character-for-character match CONTEXT section entries | CONFIRMED |
| A-3 | CS self-reference (C-33) | PHASE 2 section header "CS-0 — Schema Registry Acknowledgment (executes before CS-1)" cites Schema ID: CS-2 and Schema ID: CS-3 by exact label before CS-1 content begins | CONFIRMED |

## Predicted Scores Under v15

| Variation | Expected v15 | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| V-01 | **36/36 (100.0)** | R15-V-04 base (C-40, C-41, C-42, C-43 satisfied) + bilateral sibling co-declaration in Phase 0 mandate closes C-44 |
| V-02 | **35/36 (99.7)** | Phase 3 bilateral echo present; Phase 0 mandate reverts to non-bilateral listing — fails C-44 if Phase 0 placement is required; confirms Phase 0 mandate as the co-declaration site for C-44 |
| V-03 | **36/36 (100.0)** | V-01 base (C-44 satisfied) + explicit CA row citations inside NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION block — C-43 hardened; no new criterion exposed at this reinforcement level |
| V-04 | **36/36 (100.0)** | V-01 + V-03: bilateral mandate (C-44) + row-citing NON-OVERLAP block (C-43 hardened) — two independent axes, no interference |
| V-05 | **36/36 (100.0)** | All axes compounded — maximally reinforced candidate; Phase 3 bilateral echo (V-02 axis) is the most likely source of C-45 if new criteria emerge from bilateral parity declared at both phase levels |

**Definitive target:** V-01 is the minimum-change 36/36 path (C-44 only, single innovation). V-03,
V-04, V-05 test whether the NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION row-citation specificity and Phase 3 bilateral
echo constitute new structural patterns. If v16 rubric extracts new aspirational criteria, V-05's
Phase 3 bilateral echo and its row-citing NON-OVERLAP DECLARATION are the most probable sources.
