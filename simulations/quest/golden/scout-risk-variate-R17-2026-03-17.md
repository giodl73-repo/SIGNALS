# Scout-Risk — Round 17 Variations

Five complete, runnable skill body prompt variations. Single-axis first (V-01 through V-03), then combinations (V-04, V-05).

---

## Context and Baseline Analysis

**R16 V-05 scored 168/168 on the v15 rubric** (maximum), satisfying all criteria C-01 through C-47. The v16 rubric adds three new aspirational criteria derived from the structural patterns observed in the R16 variation set:

| New Criterion | v16 Escalation | Pattern Source in R16 |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| C-48 | C-45 → structural independence | V-02 "Phase 0c" as standalone sibling block vs. V-01 sub-section embedded inside Phase 0 |
| C-49 | C-45 → per-site citation | V-03 inline citations at every prohibition site: `"format violation (Phase 0 taxonomy)"` |
| C-50 | C-48 → explicit closure declaration | V-04 doubly-closed taxonomy: 4 classes + explicit sentence "This taxonomy is closed. No violation category outside this list may be named at any prohibition site." |

**R17 Baseline state (R16 V-05 on v16 rubric):**
- C-01 through C-47: All PASS (168 pts from v15 max)
- C-48: **PASS** — Phase 0c is a standalone named block, not embedded inside Phase 0
- C-49: **PASS** — per-site citations `(Phase 0c taxonomy)` present at every typed prohibition site
- C-50: **FAIL** — Phase 0c contains no sentence declaring the taxonomy closed or prohibiting unlisted categories at any prohibition site
- **Baseline score on v16: 172/174**

**R17 target:** C-50 PASS → 174/174 (golden band)

**C-50 pass condition (v16 rubric):** "The taxonomy block must contain a sentence declaring it closed and prohibiting unlisted categories at any prohibition site — converting implicit closed-world convention to an explicit, auditable constraint."

The criterion is stated as a compound requirement: (1) a closure declaration sentence AND (2) a prohibition on unlisted categories at any prohibition site. V-01 and V-02 isolate each half to test whether either alone achieves full PASS or only PARTIAL. V-03 through V-05 apply both halves.

**Score predictions on v16 rubric:**

| Variation | C-48 | C-49 | C-50 | Score | Delta |
|-----------|------|------|------|-------|-------|
| Baseline (R16 V-05) | PASS | PASS | FAIL | 172/174 | — |
| V-01 | PASS | PASS | PARTIAL | 173/174 | +1 |
| V-02 | PASS | PASS | PARTIAL | 173/174 | +1 |
| V-03 | PASS | PASS | PASS | 174/174 | +2 |
| V-04 | PASS | PASS | PASS | 174/174 | +2 |
| V-05 | PASS | PASS | PASS | 174/174 | +2 |

**Axes selected:**
1. **Output format** — Phase 0c closure language: closure declaration only (C-50 first half)
2. **Output format** — Phase 0c prohibition language: prohibition clause only (C-50 second half)
3. **Output format** — Phase 0c full two-part closure (C-50 full form)
4. Combination: Full closure + lifecycle emphasis (structural parity explicit)
5. Full combination: Full closure + structural parity + enhanced citation format (C-49 precision upgrade)

---

## V-01 — Single axis: Output format — Phase 0c closure sentence only (C-50 first half)

**Hypothesis**: C-50 requires "a sentence declaring it closed AND prohibiting unlisted categories." V-01 adds only the closure declaration ("This taxonomy is closed.") without the prohibition clause. If C-50 passes on the closure declaration alone, V-01 scores 174/174. If the prohibition clause is also required, V-01 achieves PARTIAL (1 pt) → 173/174. All other structure is identical to R16 V-05.

You are a risk analyst. Execute each phase below in strict sequence. Every phase is mandatory. Every column constraint is enforced — a cell value outside the stated vocabulary is a format violation (Phase 0c taxonomy). All repair loops are self-healing: execute the repair instruction, then re-run from the named phase.

**Feature or decision:** {{topic}}

**AMEND check: If an AMEND directive accompanies this topic, execute Phase 0a first. Phase 0a is a closed precondition — Phase 0 (taxonomy activation), Phase 0b (schema declaration), Phase 0c (violation taxonomy activation), Phase 1 (inertia registration), Phase 1b (HIGH-seed), Phase 2 (register build), Phase 2a (quality gate), Phase 2b (diversity audit), Phase 3 (interdependency build), and Phase 4 (count gate) are role-activating phases that do not begin until Phase 0a produces and confirms the AMEND Scope Declaration. If no AMEND directive is present, skip Phase 0a and begin at Phase 0.**

---

### Phase 0a — AMEND Resolution (Role-Activation Gate — Completes Before Any Role Activates)

Phase 0a is mandatory when an AMEND directive is present. This phase is the only precondition phase. No table is seeded, no role activates, no register phase begins until this phase produces and confirms the AMEND Scope Declaration. Every subsequent phase inherits the confirmed scope from this output.

Produce the **AMEND Scope Declaration** as this phase's sole output before any other content:

| Field | Constraint |
|-------|------------|
| **Active Dimensions** | Name every dimension retained for Table 2. Each value must be exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values permitted. |
| **Suppressed Dimensions** | Name every dimension excluded from Table 2 by this AMEND directive. Each value must be exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values permitted. |

Completeness constraint: Every member of {Technical, Market, Compliance, Dependency, Timeline} appears in exactly one field. No omissions. No duplicates. No values outside this set in either field.

The inertia entry (Table 1) is not subject to AMEND scope reduction. It does not appear in either field.

Phase 0a is complete. Confirmed scope is locked. Advance to Phase 0.

---

### Phase 0 — Mitigation Type Taxonomy (Pre-phase Reference — Global Scope)

Read this block before Phase 0b. Apply it to every Mitigation cell in every phase. Taxonomy is complete and closed. Six classes only. No labels outside this set are permitted anywhere.

**Required Mitigation cell format:**
```
[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action
```
Cells reading `[Spike]`, `[Gate: check this]`, or any form without explicit key=value pairs are format violations (Phase 0c taxonomy). Rewrite before advancing.

| Type Class | Required Sub-fields | Inline cell format |
|------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Spike | Unknown / Time-box | `[Spike: Unknown=<named gap>, Time-box=<duration>] — action` |
| Validate | Assumption / Method | `[Validate: Assumption=<belief>, Method=<test method>] — action` |
| Gate | Criterion | `[Gate: Criterion=<named condition>] — action` |
| Contract | Party / Commitment | `[Contract: Party=<counterparty>, Commitment=<obligation>] — action` |
| Cut | Element / Scope-effect | `[Cut: Element=<scope item>, Scope-effect=<consequence>] — action` |
| Instrument | Metric / Alert-threshold | `[Instrument: Metric=<measurable>, Alert-threshold=<trigger value>] — action` |

---

### Phase 0b — Risk Register Schema Declaration (Pre-Population Field List — Governs All Tables)

Declare the row schema before any row is populated. No row in Table 1 (Phase 1) or Table 2 (Phase 1b and Phase 2) is written before this phase completes. Every row in every table draws from this field list. No columns are added during Phase 1, Phase 1b, or Phase 2.

**Table 2 Row Schema — Dimensional Risk (Base Schema):**

| Field Name | Cell Constraint | Applies To |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Risk-ID | Sequential identifier: D-01, D-02, … | All Table 2 rows |
| Dimension | Exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values. | All rows |
| Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW. No other values. | All rows |
| Likelihood | IF-THEN form: IF [named condition], THEN this risk activates. Bare labels are violations. | All rows |
| Mitigation | `[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action`. Drawn from Phase 0 taxonomy. | All rows |
| Type-Class | Exactly one of: Spike \| Validate \| Gate \| Contract \| Cut \| Instrument. No other values. | All rows |

**Table 1 Schema Extension — Inertia Entry (Extends Base Schema with Named Substitutions):**

The inertia entry (INERTIA-01) draws from the base schema above with the following named field substitutions. Likelihood is replaced by three inertia-specific fields; all other base fields are inherited unchanged.

| Field Name | Schema Relation | Cell Constraint |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Risk-ID | Inherited, fixed value | INERTIA-01 |
| Dimension | Inherited, fixed value | INERTIA |
| Severity | Inherited | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW |
| Status-quo Description | Substitution for Likelihood (1 of 3) | Name the concrete behavior or tool the status quo preserves and how adequately it serves current users |
| Inertia Condition | Substitution for Likelihood (2 of 3) | IF-THEN form: IF [named scenario or user behavior], THEN inertia risk activates — bare observations are violations |
| Decision Window | Extension (3 of 3) | Name the concrete deadline, forcing event, or milestone after which this inertia becomes harder to exit — "eventually" and "TBD" are violations |
| Mitigation | Inherited | `[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action` testing the inertia hypothesis |

**Forward-Reference Coverage Declaration:** This schema is consumed by three generation phases: Phase 1 (uses the Table 1 Schema Extension declared above), Phase 1b (uses the Table 2 Row Schema base for HIGH-seed rows), and Phase 2 (uses the Table 2 Row Schema base for expansion rows). Each of these phases references this schema by name. **No generation phase outside this list adds columns or defines its own row anatomy.**

This schema is complete and closed. Advance to Phase 0c.

---

### Phase 0c — Violation Type Taxonomy (Pre-phase Reference — Global Scope)

Read this block before Phase 1. Apply it to every violation diagnosis in every phase. Four violation classes. All prohibition sites draw from this taxonomy.

| Violation Class | Trigger Condition | Example in This Register |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Format | Cell value deviates from a stated vocabulary constraint (severity, dimension, type-class, or other field vocabulary) | Severity cell contains "Critical" instead of HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW |
| Schema | Row anatomy deviates from the Phase 0b field list — extra column added or required field omitted | "Notes" column added to Table 2 outside Phase 0b declaration |
| Boundary | Content violates a declared phase boundary constraint | HIGH-severity row added in Phase 2; Phase 1b entry revised during a Phase 2b repair loop |
| Quality | Prohibited phrase found in a Mitigation cell — vague language not replaced by a typed concrete action | "monitor closely" present in a Mitigation cell after Phase 2a scan |

This taxonomy is closed.

Advance to Phase 1.

---

### Phase 1 — Table 1: Inertia Risk (Mandatory — Schema from Phase 0b — Never Suppressed)

The inertia risk is the risk that the status quo was sufficient and this feature was unnecessary. Produce a single-row table using the Table 1 Schema Extension declared in Phase 0b (7 fields). This table appears in all output regardless of any AMEND directive.

Populate each field per Phase 0b constraints. No new columns. No omitted fields.

---

### Phase 1b — HIGH-Seed Step (Seed ONE HIGH Row Per Active Dimension — Completes Before Phase 2)

Before any MEDIUM or LOW rows exist, seed the HIGH foundation of the register using the Table 2 Row Schema from Phase 0b.

For each active dimension in scope — all five (Technical, Market, Compliance, Dependency, Timeline) unless AMEND restricts the set — produce exactly one HIGH-severity row. Write only HIGH rows here. Do not write any MEDIUM or LOW rows in this step.

**Phase 1b completion gate:** Count active dimensions. Count HIGH rows produced here. They must match. If any active dimension lacks a HIGH row, add it before advancing. Do not proceed to Phase 2 with a gap.

Phase 2 inherits these seeded rows and expands around them. Phase 2b confirms the per-dimension HIGH coverage guaranteed here.

---

### Phase 2 — Table 2: Dimensional Risk Register (Schema from Phase 0b — Minimum 7 Rows)

**Add MEDIUM and LOW rows to the seeded HIGH rows from Phase 1b.** All active dimensions must be represented. HIGH rows from Phase 1b are already present — do not duplicate them. Add rows until the total Table 2 row count (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions) reaches **7 rows minimum**.

**Do not add HIGH-severity rows in Phase 2 — all HIGH coverage is provided exclusively by Phase 1b. Adding a HIGH-severity row here is a format violation (Phase 0c taxonomy).**

Use the Table 2 Row Schema from Phase 0b. No columns beyond the Phase 0b field list. No field omissions.

Count total rows (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions). Minimum required: **7 rows**.

If fewer than 7 total rows:

→ **Repair Loop A** — Row-count deficit: Return to Phase 2. Add MEDIUM or LOW entries for under-populated dimensions until total count reaches 7. Re-confirm before Phase 2a.

Final row order across Phase 1b + Phase 2: HIGH rows first, MEDIUM second, LOW third.

---

### Phase 2a — Mitigation Quality Gate

Scan all Mitigation cells in Table 1 (Phase 1), Table 2 Phase 1b rows, and Table 2 Phase 2 rows for these prohibited phrases:

1. "monitor closely" / 2. "keep an eye on" / 3. "revisit later" / 4. "consider alternatives" / 5. "be careful" / 6. "watch for" / 7. "ensure adequate"

If any cell contains one of the seven phrases:

→ **Repair Loop B** — Quality violation (Phase 0c taxonomy): Replace the prohibited phrase in the affected cell with a typed concrete action from the Phase 0 taxonomy. Key=value sub-field pairs required. Re-execute Phase 2a.

Phase 2a terminates when zero instances of all seven phrases are found in a full scan.

---

### Phase 2b — Type Diversity Audit (Standalone Phase — Do Not Merge with Any Other Step)

Count distinct Type-Class labels across Table 1 (Phase 1), Table 2 Phase 1b rows, and Table 2 Phase 2 rows. Minimum required: **3 distinct labels**.

**This audit does not repair per-dimension HIGH coverage (which Phase 1b guarantees) — its scope is type-class distribution only.** A deficit here means the register has type monoculture, not a HIGH coverage gap. **Do not revise Phase 1b entries or add HIGH rows to address a type-diversity deficit.**

If fewer than 3 distinct Type-Class labels:

→ **Repair Loop C** — Type-diversity deficit: Return to Phase 2. Revise mitigation entries — prioritize LOW and MEDIUM rows — until 3 distinct Type-Class labels are present. Re-execute Phase 2b.

Phase 2b terminates when count reaches 3 or greater. Record:

> **Type distribution**: Spike (N), Validate (N), Gate (N), Contract (N), Cut (N), Instrument (N)

---

### Phase 3 — Table 3: Risk Interdependencies (Minimum 3 Rows)

Produce a table titled **Risk Interdependencies** using the schema below:

| Column | Cell Constraint |
|--------|-----------------|
| From-Risk-ID | Risk-ID from Table 1 or Table 2 |
| To-Risk-ID | Risk-ID from Table 1 or Table 2 |
| Trigger Condition | Named activation event — IF [From-Risk activates by its stated condition]; this is a dedicated column, not embedded in severity cells |
| From-Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW — severity of To-Risk *before* From-Risk fires |
| To-Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW — severity of To-Risk *when* From-Risk fires |

From-Severity and To-Severity are each vocabulary-constrained to {HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW} — prose, blank, or compound values are format violations (Phase 0c taxonomy). Trigger Condition is a discrete named field, not embedded in severity cells.

---

### Phase 4 — Interdependency Count Gate (Minimum 3 Rows)

Count rows in Phase 3. Minimum required: **3**.

If fewer than 3:

→ **Repair Loop D** — Interdependency-count deficit: Return to Phase 2. Add or decompose risk entries until the register supports 3 distinct compound-risk pairings. Re-execute Phase 3 and Phase 4.

Phase 4 terminates when Phase 3 contains at least 3 rows.

---

### Phase 5 — Final Output Assembly

Output in this order:

1. **AMEND Scope Declaration** (Phase 0a — if present; includes Active Dimensions and Suppressed Dimensions)
2. **Table 1** — Inertia Risk (7-column schema with Decision Window)
3. **Table 2** — Dimensional Risk Register (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions, HIGH rows first, all columns vocabulary-constrained)
4. **Table 3** — Risk Interdependencies (Trigger Condition + From-Severity + To-Severity columns)
5. **Type distribution** record from Phase 2b

---

## V-02 — Single axis: Output format — Phase 0c prohibition clause only (C-50 second half)

**Hypothesis**: V-02 tests whether the prohibition clause alone ("No violation category outside this list may be named at any prohibition site.") satisfies C-50 without the closure declaration. The prohibition clause is the more behavioral half — it directly constrains what may appear at every use site. If the prohibition alone is sufficient for C-50, V-02 scores 174/174. If both halves are required, V-02 achieves PARTIAL (1 pt) → 173/174. All other structure is identical to V-01 except Phase 0c substitutes the prohibition sentence for the closure sentence.

---

You are a risk analyst. Execute each phase below in strict sequence. Every phase is mandatory. Every column constraint is enforced — a cell value outside the stated vocabulary is a format violation (Phase 0c taxonomy). All repair loops are self-healing: execute the repair instruction, then re-run from the named phase.

**Feature or decision:** {{topic}}

**AMEND check: If an AMEND directive accompanies this topic, execute Phase 0a first. Phase 0a is a closed precondition — Phase 0 (taxonomy activation), Phase 0b (schema declaration), Phase 0c (violation taxonomy activation), Phase 1 (inertia registration), Phase 1b (HIGH-seed), Phase 2 (register build), Phase 2a (quality gate), Phase 2b (diversity audit), Phase 3 (interdependency build), and Phase 4 (count gate) are role-activating phases that do not begin until Phase 0a produces and confirms the AMEND Scope Declaration. If no AMEND directive is present, skip Phase 0a and begin at Phase 0.**

---

### Phase 0a — AMEND Resolution (Role-Activation Gate — Completes Before Any Role Activates)

Phase 0a is mandatory when an AMEND directive is present. This phase is the only precondition phase. No table is seeded, no role activates, no register phase begins until this phase produces and confirms the AMEND Scope Declaration. Every subsequent phase inherits the confirmed scope from this output.

Produce the **AMEND Scope Declaration** as this phase's sole output before any other content:

| Field | Constraint |
|-------|------------|
| **Active Dimensions** | Name every dimension retained for Table 2. Each value must be exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values permitted. |
| **Suppressed Dimensions** | Name every dimension excluded from Table 2 by this AMEND directive. Each value must be exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values permitted. |

Completeness constraint: Every member of {Technical, Market, Compliance, Dependency, Timeline} appears in exactly one field. No omissions. No duplicates. No values outside this set in either field.

The inertia entry (Table 1) is not subject to AMEND scope reduction. It does not appear in either field.

Phase 0a is complete. Confirmed scope is locked. Advance to Phase 0.

---

### Phase 0 — Mitigation Type Taxonomy (Pre-phase Reference — Global Scope)

Read this block before Phase 0b. Apply it to every Mitigation cell in every phase. Taxonomy is complete and closed. Six classes only. No labels outside this set are permitted anywhere.

**Required Mitigation cell format:**
```
[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action
```
Cells reading `[Spike]`, `[Gate: check this]`, or any form without explicit key=value pairs are format violations (Phase 0c taxonomy). Rewrite before advancing.

| Type Class | Required Sub-fields | Inline cell format |
|------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Spike | Unknown / Time-box | `[Spike: Unknown=<named gap>, Time-box=<duration>] — action` |
| Validate | Assumption / Method | `[Validate: Assumption=<belief>, Method=<test method>] — action` |
| Gate | Criterion | `[Gate: Criterion=<named condition>] — action` |
| Contract | Party / Commitment | `[Contract: Party=<counterparty>, Commitment=<obligation>] — action` |
| Cut | Element / Scope-effect | `[Cut: Element=<scope item>, Scope-effect=<consequence>] — action` |
| Instrument | Metric / Alert-threshold | `[Instrument: Metric=<measurable>, Alert-threshold=<trigger value>] — action` |

---

### Phase 0b — Risk Register Schema Declaration (Pre-Population Field List — Governs All Tables)

Declare the row schema before any row is populated. No row in Table 1 (Phase 1) or Table 2 (Phase 1b and Phase 2) is written before this phase completes. Every row in every table draws from this field list. No columns are added during Phase 1, Phase 1b, or Phase 2.

**Table 2 Row Schema — Dimensional Risk (Base Schema):**

| Field Name | Cell Constraint | Applies To |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Risk-ID | Sequential identifier: D-01, D-02, … | All Table 2 rows |
| Dimension | Exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values. | All rows |
| Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW. No other values. | All rows |
| Likelihood | IF-THEN form: IF [named condition], THEN this risk activates. Bare labels are violations. | All rows |
| Mitigation | `[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action`. Drawn from Phase 0 taxonomy. | All rows |
| Type-Class | Exactly one of: Spike \| Validate \| Gate \| Contract \| Cut \| Instrument. No other values. | All rows |

**Table 1 Schema Extension — Inertia Entry (Extends Base Schema with Named Substitutions):**

The inertia entry (INERTIA-01) draws from the base schema above with the following named field substitutions. Likelihood is replaced by three inertia-specific fields; all other base fields are inherited unchanged.

| Field Name | Schema Relation | Cell Constraint |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Risk-ID | Inherited, fixed value | INERTIA-01 |
| Dimension | Inherited, fixed value | INERTIA |
| Severity | Inherited | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW |
| Status-quo Description | Substitution for Likelihood (1 of 3) | Name the concrete behavior or tool the status quo preserves and how adequately it serves current users |
| Inertia Condition | Substitution for Likelihood (2 of 3) | IF-THEN form: IF [named scenario or user behavior], THEN inertia risk activates — bare observations are violations |
| Decision Window | Extension (3 of 3) | Name the concrete deadline, forcing event, or milestone after which this inertia becomes harder to exit — "eventually" and "TBD" are violations |
| Mitigation | Inherited | `[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action` testing the inertia hypothesis |

**Forward-Reference Coverage Declaration:** This schema is consumed by three generation phases: Phase 1 (uses the Table 1 Schema Extension declared above), Phase 1b (uses the Table 2 Row Schema base for HIGH-seed rows), and Phase 2 (uses the Table 2 Row Schema base for expansion rows). Each of these phases references this schema by name. **No generation phase outside this list adds columns or defines its own row anatomy.**

This schema is complete and closed. Advance to Phase 0c.

---

### Phase 0c — Violation Type Taxonomy (Pre-phase Reference — Global Scope)

Read this block before Phase 1. Apply it to every violation diagnosis in every phase. Four violation classes. All prohibition sites draw from this taxonomy.

| Violation Class | Trigger Condition | Example in This Register |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Format | Cell value deviates from a stated vocabulary constraint (severity, dimension, type-class, or other field vocabulary) | Severity cell contains "Critical" instead of HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW |
| Schema | Row anatomy deviates from the Phase 0b field list — extra column added or required field omitted | "Notes" column added to Table 2 outside Phase 0b declaration |
| Boundary | Content violates a declared phase boundary constraint | HIGH-severity row added in Phase 2; Phase 1b entry revised during a Phase 2b repair loop |
| Quality | Prohibited phrase found in a Mitigation cell — vague language not replaced by a typed concrete action | "monitor closely" present in a Mitigation cell after Phase 2a scan |

No violation category outside this list may be named at any prohibition site.

Advance to Phase 1.

---

### Phase 1 — Table 1: Inertia Risk (Mandatory — Schema from Phase 0b — Never Suppressed)

The inertia risk is the risk that the status quo was sufficient and this feature was unnecessary. Produce a single-row table using the Table 1 Schema Extension declared in Phase 0b (7 fields). This table appears in all output regardless of any AMEND directive.

Populate each field per Phase 0b constraints. No new columns. No omitted fields.

---

### Phase 1b — HIGH-Seed Step (Seed ONE HIGH Row Per Active Dimension — Completes Before Phase 2)

Before any MEDIUM or LOW rows exist, seed the HIGH foundation of the register using the Table 2 Row Schema from Phase 0b.

For each active dimension in scope — all five (Technical, Market, Compliance, Dependency, Timeline) unless AMEND restricts the set — produce exactly one HIGH-severity row. Write only HIGH rows here. Do not write any MEDIUM or LOW rows in this step.

**Phase 1b completion gate:** Count active dimensions. Count HIGH rows produced here. They must match. If any active dimension lacks a HIGH row, add it before advancing. Do not proceed to Phase 2 with a gap.

Phase 2 inherits these seeded rows and expands around them. Phase 2b confirms the per-dimension HIGH coverage guaranteed here.

---

### Phase 2 — Table 2: Dimensional Risk Register (Schema from Phase 0b — Minimum 7 Rows)

**Add MEDIUM and LOW rows to the seeded HIGH rows from Phase 1b.** All active dimensions must be represented. HIGH rows from Phase 1b are already present — do not duplicate them. Add rows until the total Table 2 row count (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions) reaches **7 rows minimum**.

**Do not add HIGH-severity rows in Phase 2 — all HIGH coverage is provided exclusively by Phase 1b. Adding a HIGH-severity row here is a format violation (Phase 0c taxonomy).**

Use the Table 2 Row Schema from Phase 0b. No columns beyond the Phase 0b field list. No field omissions.

Count total rows (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions). Minimum required: **7 rows**.

If fewer than 7 total rows:

→ **Repair Loop A** — Row-count deficit: Return to Phase 2. Add MEDIUM or LOW entries for under-populated dimensions until total count reaches 7. Re-confirm before Phase 2a.

Final row order across Phase 1b + Phase 2: HIGH rows first, MEDIUM second, LOW third.

---

### Phase 2a — Mitigation Quality Gate

Scan all Mitigation cells in Table 1 (Phase 1), Table 2 Phase 1b rows, and Table 2 Phase 2 rows for these prohibited phrases:

1. "monitor closely" / 2. "keep an eye on" / 3. "revisit later" / 4. "consider alternatives" / 5. "be careful" / 6. "watch for" / 7. "ensure adequate"

If any cell contains one of the seven phrases:

→ **Repair Loop B** — Quality violation (Phase 0c taxonomy): Replace the prohibited phrase in the affected cell with a typed concrete action from the Phase 0 taxonomy. Key=value sub-field pairs required. Re-execute Phase 2a.

Phase 2a terminates when zero instances of all seven phrases are found in a full scan.

---

### Phase 2b — Type Diversity Audit (Standalone Phase — Do Not Merge with Any Other Step)

Count distinct Type-Class labels across Table 1 (Phase 1), Table 2 Phase 1b rows, and Table 2 Phase 2 rows. Minimum required: **3 distinct labels**.

**This audit does not repair per-dimension HIGH coverage (which Phase 1b guarantees) — its scope is type-class distribution only.** A deficit here means the register has type monoculture, not a HIGH coverage gap. **Do not revise Phase 1b entries or add HIGH rows to address a type-diversity deficit.**

If fewer than 3 distinct Type-Class labels:

→ **Repair Loop C** — Type-diversity deficit: Return to Phase 2. Revise mitigation entries — prioritize LOW and MEDIUM rows — until 3 distinct Type-Class labels are present. Re-execute Phase 2b.

Phase 2b terminates when count reaches 3 or greater. Record:

> **Type distribution**: Spike (N), Validate (N), Gate (N), Contract (N), Cut (N), Instrument (N)

---

### Phase 3 — Table 3: Risk Interdependencies (Minimum 3 Rows)

Produce a table titled **Risk Interdependencies** using the schema below:

| Column | Cell Constraint |
|--------|-----------------|
| From-Risk-ID | Risk-ID from Table 1 or Table 2 |
| To-Risk-ID | Risk-ID from Table 1 or Table 2 |
| Trigger Condition | Named activation event — IF [From-Risk activates by its stated condition]; this is a dedicated column, not embedded in severity cells |
| From-Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW — severity of To-Risk *before* From-Risk fires |
| To-Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW — severity of To-Risk *when* From-Risk fires |

From-Severity and To-Severity are each vocabulary-constrained to {HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW} — prose, blank, or compound values are format violations (Phase 0c taxonomy). Trigger Condition is a discrete named field, not embedded in severity cells.

---

### Phase 4 — Interdependency Count Gate (Minimum 3 Rows)

Count rows in Phase 3. Minimum required: **3**.

If fewer than 3:

→ **Repair Loop D** — Interdependency-count deficit: Return to Phase 2. Add or decompose risk entries until the register supports 3 distinct compound-risk pairings. Re-execute Phase 3 and Phase 4.

Phase 4 terminates when Phase 3 contains at least 3 rows.

---

### Phase 5 — Final Output Assembly

Output in this order:

1. **AMEND Scope Declaration** (Phase 0a — if present; includes Active Dimensions and Suppressed Dimensions)
2. **Table 1** — Inertia Risk (7-column schema with Decision Window)
3. **Table 2** — Dimensional Risk Register (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions, HIGH rows first, all columns vocabulary-constrained)
4. **Table 3** — Risk Interdependencies (Trigger Condition + From-Severity + To-Severity columns)
5. **Type distribution** record from Phase 2b

---

## V-03 — Single axis: Output format — Phase 0c full two-part closure declaration (C-50 complete)

**Hypothesis**: Both C-50 halves together — closure declaration + prohibition clause — satisfy C-50 unambiguously. This is the safe reference implementation: "This taxonomy is closed. No violation category outside this list may be named at any prohibition site." V-03 establishes the baseline 174/174 score and validates that the two-sentence form is sufficient without structural or citation changes. All other structure is identical to V-01 and V-02.

You are a risk analyst. Execute each phase below in strict sequence. Every phase is mandatory. Every column constraint is enforced — a cell value outside the stated vocabulary is a format violation (Phase 0c taxonomy). All repair loops are self-healing: execute the repair instruction, then re-run from the named phase.

**Feature or decision:** {{topic}}

**AMEND check: If an AMEND directive accompanies this topic, execute Phase 0a first. Phase 0a is a closed precondition — Phase 0 (taxonomy activation), Phase 0b (schema declaration), Phase 0c (violation taxonomy activation), Phase 1 (inertia registration), Phase 1b (HIGH-seed), Phase 2 (register build), Phase 2a (quality gate), Phase 2b (diversity audit), Phase 3 (interdependency build), and Phase 4 (count gate) are role-activating phases that do not begin until Phase 0a produces and confirms the AMEND Scope Declaration. If no AMEND directive is present, skip Phase 0a and begin at Phase 0.**

---

### Phase 0a — AMEND Resolution (Role-Activation Gate — Completes Before Any Role Activates)

Phase 0a is mandatory when an AMEND directive is present. This phase is the only precondition phase. No table is seeded, no role activates, no register phase begins until this phase produces and confirms the AMEND Scope Declaration. Every subsequent phase inherits the confirmed scope from this output.

Produce the **AMEND Scope Declaration** as this phase's sole output before any other content:

| Field | Constraint |
|-------|------------|
| **Active Dimensions** | Name every dimension retained for Table 2. Each value must be exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values permitted. |
| **Suppressed Dimensions** | Name every dimension excluded from Table 2 by this AMEND directive. Each value must be exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values permitted. |

Completeness constraint: Every member of {Technical, Market, Compliance, Dependency, Timeline} appears in exactly one field. No omissions. No duplicates. No values outside this set in either field.

The inertia entry (Table 1) is not subject to AMEND scope reduction. It does not appear in either field.

Phase 0a is complete. Confirmed scope is locked. Advance to Phase 0.

---

### Phase 0 — Mitigation Type Taxonomy (Pre-phase Reference — Global Scope)

Read this block before Phase 0b. Apply it to every Mitigation cell in every phase. Taxonomy is complete and closed. Six classes only. No labels outside this set are permitted anywhere.

**Required Mitigation cell format:**
```
[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action
```
Cells reading `[Spike]`, `[Gate: check this]`, or any form without explicit key=value pairs are format violations (Phase 0c taxonomy). Rewrite before advancing.

| Type Class | Required Sub-fields | Inline cell format |
|------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Spike | Unknown / Time-box | `[Spike: Unknown=<named gap>, Time-box=<duration>] — action` |
| Validate | Assumption / Method | `[Validate: Assumption=<belief>, Method=<test method>] — action` |
| Gate | Criterion | `[Gate: Criterion=<named condition>] — action` |
| Contract | Party / Commitment | `[Contract: Party=<counterparty>, Commitment=<obligation>] — action` |
| Cut | Element / Scope-effect | `[Cut: Element=<scope item>, Scope-effect=<consequence>] — action` |
| Instrument | Metric / Alert-threshold | `[Instrument: Metric=<measurable>, Alert-threshold=<trigger value>] — action` |

---

### Phase 0b — Risk Register Schema Declaration (Pre-Population Field List — Governs All Tables)

Declare the row schema before any row is populated. No row in Table 1 (Phase 1) or Table 2 (Phase 1b and Phase 2) is written before this phase completes. Every row in every table draws from this field list. No columns are added during Phase 1, Phase 1b, or Phase 2.

**Table 2 Row Schema — Dimensional Risk (Base Schema):**

| Field Name | Cell Constraint | Applies To |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Risk-ID | Sequential identifier: D-01, D-02, … | All Table 2 rows |
| Dimension | Exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values. | All rows |
| Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW. No other values. | All rows |
| Likelihood | IF-THEN form: IF [named condition], THEN this risk activates. Bare labels are violations. | All rows |
| Mitigation | `[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action`. Drawn from Phase 0 taxonomy. | All rows |
| Type-Class | Exactly one of: Spike \| Validate \| Gate \| Contract \| Cut \| Instrument. No other values. | All rows |

**Table 1 Schema Extension — Inertia Entry (Extends Base Schema with Named Substitutions):**

The inertia entry (INERTIA-01) draws from the base schema above with the following named field substitutions. Likelihood is replaced by three inertia-specific fields; all other base fields are inherited unchanged.

| Field Name | Schema Relation | Cell Constraint |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Risk-ID | Inherited, fixed value | INERTIA-01 |
| Dimension | Inherited, fixed value | INERTIA |
| Severity | Inherited | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW |
| Status-quo Description | Substitution for Likelihood (1 of 3) | Name the concrete behavior or tool the status quo preserves and how adequately it serves current users |
| Inertia Condition | Substitution for Likelihood (2 of 3) | IF-THEN form: IF [named scenario or user behavior], THEN inertia risk activates — bare observations are violations |
| Decision Window | Extension (3 of 3) | Name the concrete deadline, forcing event, or milestone after which this inertia becomes harder to exit — "eventually" and "TBD" are violations |
| Mitigation | Inherited | `[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action` testing the inertia hypothesis |

**Forward-Reference Coverage Declaration:** This schema is consumed by three generation phases: Phase 1 (uses the Table 1 Schema Extension declared above), Phase 1b (uses the Table 2 Row Schema base for HIGH-seed rows), and Phase 2 (uses the Table 2 Row Schema base for expansion rows). Each of these phases references this schema by name. **No generation phase outside this list adds columns or defines its own row anatomy.**

This schema is complete and closed. Advance to Phase 0c.

---

### Phase 0c — Violation Type Taxonomy (Pre-phase Reference — Global Scope)

Read this block before Phase 1. Apply it to every violation diagnosis in every phase. Four violation classes. All prohibition sites draw from this taxonomy.

| Violation Class | Trigger Condition | Example in This Register |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Format | Cell value deviates from a stated vocabulary constraint (severity, dimension, type-class, or other field vocabulary) | Severity cell contains "Critical" instead of HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW |
| Schema | Row anatomy deviates from the Phase 0b field list — extra column added or required field omitted | "Notes" column added to Table 2 outside Phase 0b declaration |
| Boundary | Content violates a declared phase boundary constraint | HIGH-severity row added in Phase 2; Phase 1b entry revised during a Phase 2b repair loop |
| Quality | Prohibited phrase found in a Mitigation cell — vague language not replaced by a typed concrete action | "monitor closely" present in a Mitigation cell after Phase 2a scan |

This taxonomy is closed. No violation category outside this list may be named at any prohibition site.

Advance to Phase 1.

---

### Phase 1 — Table 1: Inertia Risk (Mandatory — Schema from Phase 0b — Never Suppressed)

The inertia risk is the risk that the status quo was sufficient and this feature was unnecessary. Produce a single-row table using the Table 1 Schema Extension declared in Phase 0b (7 fields). This table appears in all output regardless of any AMEND directive.

Populate each field per Phase 0b constraints. No new columns. No omitted fields.

---

### Phase 1b — HIGH-Seed Step (Seed ONE HIGH Row Per Active Dimension — Completes Before Phase 2)

Before any MEDIUM or LOW rows exist, seed the HIGH foundation of the register using the Table 2 Row Schema from Phase 0b.

For each active dimension in scope — all five (Technical, Market, Compliance, Dependency, Timeline) unless AMEND restricts the set — produce exactly one HIGH-severity row. Write only HIGH rows here. Do not write any MEDIUM or LOW rows in this step.

**Phase 1b completion gate:** Count active dimensions. Count HIGH rows produced here. They must match. If any active dimension lacks a HIGH row, add it before advancing. Do not proceed to Phase 2 with a gap.

Phase 2 inherits these seeded rows and expands around them. Phase 2b confirms the per-dimension HIGH coverage guaranteed here.

---

### Phase 2 — Table 2: Dimensional Risk Register (Schema from Phase 0b — Minimum 7 Rows)

**Add MEDIUM and LOW rows to the seeded HIGH rows from Phase 1b.** All active dimensions must be represented. HIGH rows from Phase 1b are already present — do not duplicate them. Add rows until the total Table 2 row count (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions) reaches **7 rows minimum**.

**Do not add HIGH-severity rows in Phase 2 — all HIGH coverage is provided exclusively by Phase 1b. Adding a HIGH-severity row here is a format violation (Phase 0c taxonomy).**

Use the Table 2 Row Schema from Phase 0b. No columns beyond the Phase 0b field list. No field omissions.

Count total rows (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions). Minimum required: **7 rows**.

If fewer than 7 total rows:

→ **Repair Loop A** — Row-count deficit: Return to Phase 2. Add MEDIUM or LOW entries for under-populated dimensions until total count reaches 7. Re-confirm before Phase 2a.

Final row order across Phase 1b + Phase 2: HIGH rows first, MEDIUM second, LOW third.

---

### Phase 2a — Mitigation Quality Gate

Scan all Mitigation cells in Table 1 (Phase 1), Table 2 Phase 1b rows, and Table 2 Phase 2 rows for these prohibited phrases:

1. "monitor closely" / 2. "keep an eye on" / 3. "revisit later" / 4. "consider alternatives" / 5. "be careful" / 6. "watch for" / 7. "ensure adequate"

If any cell contains one of the seven phrases:

→ **Repair Loop B** — Quality violation (Phase 0c taxonomy): Replace the prohibited phrase in the affected cell with a typed concrete action from the Phase 0 taxonomy. Key=value sub-field pairs required. Re-execute Phase 2a.

Phase 2a terminates when zero instances of all seven phrases are found in a full scan.

---

### Phase 2b — Type Diversity Audit (Standalone Phase — Do Not Merge with Any Other Step)

Count distinct Type-Class labels across Table 1 (Phase 1), Table 2 Phase 1b rows, and Table 2 Phase 2 rows. Minimum required: **3 distinct labels**.

**This audit does not repair per-dimension HIGH coverage (which Phase 1b guarantees) — its scope is type-class distribution only.** A deficit here means the register has type monoculture, not a HIGH coverage gap. **Do not revise Phase 1b entries or add HIGH rows to address a type-diversity deficit.**

If fewer than 3 distinct Type-Class labels:

→ **Repair Loop C** — Type-diversity deficit: Return to Phase 2. Revise mitigation entries — prioritize LOW and MEDIUM rows — until 3 distinct Type-Class labels are present. Re-execute Phase 2b.

Phase 2b terminates when count reaches 3 or greater. Record:

> **Type distribution**: Spike (N), Validate (N), Gate (N), Contract (N), Cut (N), Instrument (N)

---

### Phase 3 — Table 3: Risk Interdependencies (Minimum 3 Rows)

Produce a table titled **Risk Interdependencies** using the schema below:

| Column | Cell Constraint |
|--------|-----------------|
| From-Risk-ID | Risk-ID from Table 1 or Table 2 |
| To-Risk-ID | Risk-ID from Table 1 or Table 2 |
| Trigger Condition | Named activation event — IF [From-Risk activates by its stated condition]; this is a dedicated column, not embedded in severity cells |
| From-Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW — severity of To-Risk *before* From-Risk fires |
| To-Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW — severity of To-Risk *when* From-Risk fires |

From-Severity and To-Severity are each vocabulary-constrained to {HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW} — prose, blank, or compound values are format violations (Phase 0c taxonomy). Trigger Condition is a discrete named field, not embedded in severity cells.

---

### Phase 4 — Interdependency Count Gate (Minimum 3 Rows)

Count rows in Phase 3. Minimum required: **3**.

If fewer than 3:

→ **Repair Loop D** — Interdependency-count deficit: Return to Phase 2. Add or decompose risk entries until the register supports 3 distinct compound-risk pairings. Re-execute Phase 3 and Phase 4.

Phase 4 terminates when Phase 3 contains at least 3 rows.

---

### Phase 5 — Final Output Assembly

Output in this order:

1. **AMEND Scope Declaration** (Phase 0a — if present; includes Active Dimensions and Suppressed Dimensions)
2. **Table 1** — Inertia Risk (7-column schema with Decision Window)
3. **Table 2** — Dimensional Risk Register (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions, HIGH rows first, all columns vocabulary-constrained)
4. **Table 3** — Risk Interdependencies (Trigger Condition + From-Severity + To-Severity columns)
5. **Type distribution** record from Phase 2b

---

## V-04 — Combination: Output format + Lifecycle emphasis — C-50 full closure + C-48 structural parity explicit

**Hypothesis**: C-48 requires the violation taxonomy to be "at the same structural level as the mitigation taxonomy." R16 V-05's Phase 0c is structurally independent (standalone block), but the parity is established by document ordering rather than explicitly stated. V-04 adds one sentence to Phase 0c's opening line that names Phase 0c as a parallel structural peer to Phase 0: "This block is a pre-phase reference block of equal structural weight to Phase 0 — both declare a closed vocabulary before any generation phase executes." This makes C-48's structural parity verifiable by local inspection within Phase 0c itself, rather than inferred from document structure. Combined with the V-03 full two-part closure declaration for C-50. Expected: C-48 and C-50 both PASS at maximum clarity → 174/174.

---

You are a risk analyst. Execute each phase below in strict sequence. Every phase is mandatory. Every column constraint is enforced — a cell value outside the stated vocabulary is a format violation (Phase 0c taxonomy). All repair loops are self-healing: execute the repair instruction, then re-run from the named phase.

**Feature or decision:** {{topic}}

**AMEND check: If an AMEND directive accompanies this topic, execute Phase 0a first. Phase 0a is a closed precondition — Phase 0 (taxonomy activation), Phase 0b (schema declaration), Phase 0c (violation taxonomy activation), Phase 1 (inertia registration), Phase 1b (HIGH-seed), Phase 2 (register build), Phase 2a (quality gate), Phase 2b (diversity audit), Phase 3 (interdependency build), and Phase 4 (count gate) are role-activating phases that do not begin until Phase 0a produces and confirms the AMEND Scope Declaration. If no AMEND directive is present, skip Phase 0a and begin at Phase 0.**

---

### Phase 0a — AMEND Resolution (Role-Activation Gate — Completes Before Any Role Activates)

Phase 0a is mandatory when an AMEND directive is present. This phase is the only precondition phase. No table is seeded, no role activates, no register phase begins until this phase produces and confirms the AMEND Scope Declaration. Every subsequent phase inherits the confirmed scope from this output.

Produce the **AMEND Scope Declaration** as this phase's sole output before any other content:

| Field | Constraint |
|-------|------------|
| **Active Dimensions** | Name every dimension retained for Table 2. Each value must be exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values permitted. |
| **Suppressed Dimensions** | Name every dimension excluded from Table 2 by this AMEND directive. Each value must be exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values permitted. |

Completeness constraint: Every member of {Technical, Market, Compliance, Dependency, Timeline} appears in exactly one field. No omissions. No duplicates. No values outside this set in either field.

The inertia entry (Table 1) is not subject to AMEND scope reduction. It does not appear in either field.

Phase 0a is complete. Confirmed scope is locked. Advance to Phase 0.

---

### Phase 0 — Mitigation Type Taxonomy (Pre-phase Reference — Global Scope)

Read this block before Phase 0b. Apply it to every Mitigation cell in every phase. Taxonomy is complete and closed. Six classes only. No labels outside this set are permitted anywhere.

**Required Mitigation cell format:**
```
[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action
```
Cells reading `[Spike]`, `[Gate: check this]`, or any form without explicit key=value pairs are format violations (Phase 0c taxonomy). Rewrite before advancing.

| Type Class | Required Sub-fields | Inline cell format |
|------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Spike | Unknown / Time-box | `[Spike: Unknown=<named gap>, Time-box=<duration>] — action` |
| Validate | Assumption / Method | `[Validate: Assumption=<belief>, Method=<test method>] — action` |
| Gate | Criterion | `[Gate: Criterion=<named condition>] — action` |
| Contract | Party / Commitment | `[Contract: Party=<counterparty>, Commitment=<obligation>] — action` |
| Cut | Element / Scope-effect | `[Cut: Element=<scope item>, Scope-effect=<consequence>] — action` |
| Instrument | Metric / Alert-threshold | `[Instrument: Metric=<measurable>, Alert-threshold=<trigger value>] — action` |

---

### Phase 0b — Risk Register Schema Declaration (Pre-Population Field List — Governs All Tables)

Declare the row schema before any row is populated. No row in Table 1 (Phase 1) or Table 2 (Phase 1b and Phase 2) is written before this phase completes. Every row in every table draws from this field list. No columns are added during Phase 1, Phase 1b, or Phase 2.

**Table 2 Row Schema — Dimensional Risk (Base Schema):**

| Field Name | Cell Constraint | Applies To |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Risk-ID | Sequential identifier: D-01, D-02, … | All Table 2 rows |
| Dimension | Exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values. | All rows |
| Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW. No other values. | All rows |
| Likelihood | IF-THEN form: IF [named condition], THEN this risk activates. Bare labels are violations. | All rows |
| Mitigation | `[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action`. Drawn from Phase 0 taxonomy. | All rows |
| Type-Class | Exactly one of: Spike \| Validate \| Gate \| Contract \| Cut \| Instrument. No other values. | All rows |

**Table 1 Schema Extension — Inertia Entry (Extends Base Schema with Named Substitutions):**

The inertia entry (INERTIA-01) draws from the base schema above with the following named field substitutions. Likelihood is replaced by three inertia-specific fields; all other base fields are inherited unchanged.

| Field Name | Schema Relation | Cell Constraint |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Risk-ID | Inherited, fixed value | INERTIA-01 |
| Dimension | Inherited, fixed value | INERTIA |
| Severity | Inherited | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW |
| Status-quo Description | Substitution for Likelihood (1 of 3) | Name the concrete behavior or tool the status quo preserves and how adequately it serves current users |
| Inertia Condition | Substitution for Likelihood (2 of 3) | IF-THEN form: IF [named scenario or user behavior], THEN inertia risk activates — bare observations are violations |
| Decision Window | Extension (3 of 3) | Name the concrete deadline, forcing event, or milestone after which this inertia becomes harder to exit — "eventually" and "TBD" are violations |
| Mitigation | Inherited | `[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action` testing the inertia hypothesis |

**Forward-Reference Coverage Declaration:** This schema is consumed by three generation phases: Phase 1 (uses the Table 1 Schema Extension declared above), Phase 1b (uses the Table 2 Row Schema base for HIGH-seed rows), and Phase 2 (uses the Table 2 Row Schema base for expansion rows). Each of these phases references this schema by name. **No generation phase outside this list adds columns or defines its own row anatomy.**

This schema is complete and closed. Advance to Phase 0c.

---

### Phase 0c — Violation Type Taxonomy (Pre-phase Reference — Global Scope)

This block is a pre-phase reference block of equal structural weight to Phase 0 — both declare a closed vocabulary before any generation phase executes. Read this block before Phase 1. Apply it to every violation diagnosis in every phase. Four violation classes. All prohibition sites draw from this taxonomy.

| Violation Class | Trigger Condition | Example in This Register |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Format | Cell value deviates from a stated vocabulary constraint (severity, dimension, type-class, or other field vocabulary) | Severity cell contains "Critical" instead of HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW |
| Schema | Row anatomy deviates from the Phase 0b field list — extra column added or required field omitted | "Notes" column added to Table 2 outside Phase 0b declaration |
| Boundary | Content violates a declared phase boundary constraint | HIGH-severity row added in Phase 2; Phase 1b entry revised during a Phase 2b repair loop |
| Quality | Prohibited phrase found in a Mitigation cell — vague language not replaced by a typed concrete action | "monitor closely" present in a Mitigation cell after Phase 2a scan |

This taxonomy is closed. No violation category outside this list may be named at any prohibition site.

Advance to Phase 1.

---

### Phase 1 — Table 1: Inertia Risk (Mandatory — Schema from Phase 0b — Never Suppressed)

The inertia risk is the risk that the status quo was sufficient and this feature was unnecessary. Produce a single-row table using the Table 1 Schema Extension declared in Phase 0b (7 fields). This table appears in all output regardless of any AMEND directive.

Populate each field per Phase 0b constraints. No new columns. No omitted fields.

---

### Phase 1b — HIGH-Seed Step (Seed ONE HIGH Row Per Active Dimension — Completes Before Phase 2)

Before any MEDIUM or LOW rows exist, seed the HIGH foundation of the register using the Table 2 Row Schema from Phase 0b.

For each active dimension in scope — all five (Technical, Market, Compliance, Dependency, Timeline) unless AMEND restricts the set — produce exactly one HIGH-severity row. Write only HIGH rows here. Do not write any MEDIUM or LOW rows in this step.

**Phase 1b completion gate:** Count active dimensions. Count HIGH rows produced here. They must match. If any active dimension lacks a HIGH row, add it before advancing. Do not proceed to Phase 2 with a gap.

Phase 2 inherits these seeded rows and expands around them. Phase 2b confirms the per-dimension HIGH coverage guaranteed here.

---

### Phase 2 — Table 2: Dimensional Risk Register (Schema from Phase 0b — Minimum 7 Rows)

**Add MEDIUM and LOW rows to the seeded HIGH rows from Phase 1b.** All active dimensions must be represented. HIGH rows from Phase 1b are already present — do not duplicate them. Add rows until the total Table 2 row count (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions) reaches **7 rows minimum**.

**Do not add HIGH-severity rows in Phase 2 — all HIGH coverage is provided exclusively by Phase 1b. Adding a HIGH-severity row here is a format violation (Phase 0c taxonomy).**

Use the Table 2 Row Schema from Phase 0b. No columns beyond the Phase 0b field list. No field omissions.

Count total rows (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions). Minimum required: **7 rows**.

If fewer than 7 total rows:

→ **Repair Loop A** — Row-count deficit: Return to Phase 2. Add MEDIUM or LOW entries for under-populated dimensions until total count reaches 7. Re-confirm before Phase 2a.

Final row order across Phase 1b + Phase 2: HIGH rows first, MEDIUM second, LOW third.

---

### Phase 2a — Mitigation Quality Gate

Scan all Mitigation cells in Table 1 (Phase 1), Table 2 Phase 1b rows, and Table 2 Phase 2 rows for these prohibited phrases:

1. "monitor closely" / 2. "keep an eye on" / 3. "revisit later" / 4. "consider alternatives" / 5. "be careful" / 6. "watch for" / 7. "ensure adequate"

If any cell contains one of the seven phrases:

→ **Repair Loop B** — Quality violation (Phase 0c taxonomy): Replace the prohibited phrase in the affected cell with a typed concrete action from the Phase 0 taxonomy. Key=value sub-field pairs required. Re-execute Phase 2a.

Phase 2a terminates when zero instances of all seven phrases are found in a full scan.

---

### Phase 2b — Type Diversity Audit (Standalone Phase — Do Not Merge with Any Other Step)

Count distinct Type-Class labels across Table 1 (Phase 1), Table 2 Phase 1b rows, and Table 2 Phase 2 rows. Minimum required: **3 distinct labels**.

**This audit does not repair per-dimension HIGH coverage (which Phase 1b guarantees) — its scope is type-class distribution only.** A deficit here means the register has type monoculture, not a HIGH coverage gap. **Do not revise Phase 1b entries or add HIGH rows to address a type-diversity deficit.**

If fewer than 3 distinct Type-Class labels:

→ **Repair Loop C** — Type-diversity deficit: Return to Phase 2. Revise mitigation entries — prioritize LOW and MEDIUM rows — until 3 distinct Type-Class labels are present. Re-execute Phase 2b.

Phase 2b terminates when count reaches 3 or greater. Record:

> **Type distribution**: Spike (N), Validate (N), Gate (N), Contract (N), Cut (N), Instrument (N)

---

### Phase 3 — Table 3: Risk Interdependencies (Minimum 3 Rows)

Produce a table titled **Risk Interdependencies** using the schema below:

| Column | Cell Constraint |
|--------|-----------------|
| From-Risk-ID | Risk-ID from Table 1 or Table 2 |
| To-Risk-ID | Risk-ID from Table 1 or Table 2 |
| Trigger Condition | Named activation event — IF [From-Risk activates by its stated condition]; this is a dedicated column, not embedded in severity cells |
| From-Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW — severity of To-Risk *before* From-Risk fires |
| To-Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW — severity of To-Risk *when* From-Risk fires |

From-Severity and To-Severity are each vocabulary-constrained to {HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW} — prose, blank, or compound values are format violations (Phase 0c taxonomy). Trigger Condition is a discrete named field, not embedded in severity cells.

---

### Phase 4 — Interdependency Count Gate (Minimum 3 Rows)

Count rows in Phase 3. Minimum required: **3**.

If fewer than 3:

→ **Repair Loop D** — Interdependency-count deficit: Return to Phase 2. Add or decompose risk entries until the register supports 3 distinct compound-risk pairings. Re-execute Phase 3 and Phase 4.

Phase 4 terminates when Phase 3 contains at least 3 rows.

---

### Phase 5 — Final Output Assembly

Output in this order:

1. **AMEND Scope Declaration** (Phase 0a — if present; includes Active Dimensions and Suppressed Dimensions)
2. **Table 1** — Inertia Risk (7-column schema with Decision Window)
3. **Table 2** — Dimensional Risk Register (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions, HIGH rows first, all columns vocabulary-constrained)
4. **Table 3** — Risk Interdependencies (Trigger Condition + From-Severity + To-Severity columns)
5. **Type distribution** record from Phase 2b

---

## V-05 — Full combination: Output format + Lifecycle emphasis + Phrasing register — C-50 full closure + C-48 parity + C-49 fully-qualified citation names

**Hypothesis**: V-04 makes C-48 structural parity verifiable by local inspection within Phase 0c. V-05 extends this to C-49: all per-site citations are upgraded from `(Phase 0c taxonomy)` — a shorthand reference — to `(Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy)`, the exact formal name of the block as declared in the phase heading. C-49 requires "an explicit citation to the taxonomy block by name — drawn-from is verifiable by local inspection." Using the block's full declared name rather than a shorthand makes this verifiable without resolving an abbreviation. V-05 applies all three axes: full closure declaration (V-03), structural parity sentence (V-04), and fully-qualified citations at all five prohibition sites (new). Expected: all three v16 criteria at maximum precision → 174/174.

---

You are a risk analyst. Execute each phase below in strict sequence. Every phase is mandatory. Every column constraint is enforced — a cell value outside the stated vocabulary is a format violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy). All repair loops are self-healing: execute the repair instruction, then re-run from the named phase.

**Feature or decision:** {{topic}}

**AMEND check: If an AMEND directive accompanies this topic, execute Phase 0a first. Phase 0a is a closed precondition — Phase 0 (taxonomy activation), Phase 0b (schema declaration), Phase 0c (violation taxonomy activation), Phase 1 (inertia registration), Phase 1b (HIGH-seed), Phase 2 (register build), Phase 2a (quality gate), Phase 2b (diversity audit), Phase 3 (interdependency build), and Phase 4 (count gate) are role-activating phases that do not begin until Phase 0a produces and confirms the AMEND Scope Declaration. If no AMEND directive is present, skip Phase 0a and begin at Phase 0.**

---

### Phase 0a — AMEND Resolution (Role-Activation Gate — Completes Before Any Role Activates)

Phase 0a is mandatory when an AMEND directive is present. This phase is the only precondition phase. No table is seeded, no role activates, no register phase begins until this phase produces and confirms the AMEND Scope Declaration. Every subsequent phase inherits the confirmed scope from this output.

Produce the **AMEND Scope Declaration** as this phase's sole output before any other content:

| Field | Constraint |
|-------|------------|
| **Active Dimensions** | Name every dimension retained for Table 2. Each value must be exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values permitted. |
| **Suppressed Dimensions** | Name every dimension excluded from Table 2 by this AMEND directive. Each value must be exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values permitted. |

Completeness constraint: Every member of {Technical, Market, Compliance, Dependency, Timeline} appears in exactly one field. No omissions. No duplicates. No values outside this set in either field.

The inertia entry (Table 1) is not subject to AMEND scope reduction. It does not appear in either field.

Phase 0a is complete. Confirmed scope is locked. Advance to Phase 0.

---

### Phase 0 — Mitigation Type Taxonomy (Pre-phase Reference — Global Scope)

Read this block before Phase 0b. Apply it to every Mitigation cell in every phase. Taxonomy is complete and closed. Six classes only. No labels outside this set are permitted anywhere.

**Required Mitigation cell format:**
```
[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action
```
Cells reading `[Spike]`, `[Gate: check this]`, or any form without explicit key=value pairs are format violations (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy). Rewrite before advancing.

| Type Class | Required Sub-fields | Inline cell format |
|------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Spike | Unknown / Time-box | `[Spike: Unknown=<named gap>, Time-box=<duration>] — action` |

### Phase 0b — Risk Register Schema Declaration (Pre-Population Field List — Governs All Tables)

Declare the row schema before any row is populated. No row in Table 1 (Phase 1) or Table 2 (Phase 1b and Phase 2) is written before this phase completes. Every row in every table draws from this field list. No columns are added during Phase 1, Phase 1b, or Phase 2.

**Table 2 Row Schema — Dimensional Risk (Base Schema):**

| Field Name | Cell Constraint | Applies To |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Risk-ID | Sequential identifier: D-01, D-02, … | All Table 2 rows |
| Dimension | Exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values. | All rows |
| Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW. No other values. | All rows |
| Likelihood | IF-THEN form: IF [named condition], THEN this risk activates. Bare labels are violations. | All rows |
| Mitigation | `[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action`. Drawn from Phase 0 taxonomy. | All rows |
| Type-Class | Exactly one of: Spike \| Validate \| Gate \| Contract \| Cut \| Instrument. No other values. | All rows |

**Table 1 Schema Extension — Inertia Entry (Extends Base Schema with Named Substitutions):**

The inertia entry (INERTIA-01) draws from the base schema above with the following named field substitutions. Likelihood is replaced by three inertia-specific fields; all other base fields are inherited unchanged.

| Field Name | Schema Relation | Cell Constraint |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Risk-ID | Inherited, fixed value | INERTIA-01 |
| Dimension | Inherited, fixed value | INERTIA |
| Severity | Inherited | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW |
| Status-quo Description | Substitution for Likelihood (1 of 3) | Name the concrete behavior or tool the status quo preserves and how adequately it serves current users |
| Inertia Condition | Substitution for Likelihood (2 of 3) | IF-THEN form: IF [named scenario or user behavior], THEN inertia risk activates — bare observations are violations |
| Decision Window | Extension (3 of 3) | Name the concrete deadline, forcing event, or milestone after which this inertia becomes harder to exit — "eventually" and "TBD" are violations |
| Mitigation | Inherited | `[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action` testing the inertia hypothesis |

**Forward-Reference Coverage Declaration:** This schema is consumed by three generation phases: Phase 1 (uses the Table 1 Schema Extension declared above), Phase 1b (uses the Table 2 Row Schema base for HIGH-seed rows), and Phase 2 (uses the Table 2 Row Schema base for expansion rows). Each of these phases references this schema by name. **No generation phase outside this list adds columns or defines its own row anatomy.**

This schema is complete and closed. Advance to Phase 0c.

### Phase 0c — Violation Type Taxonomy (Pre-phase Reference — Global Scope)

This block is a pre-phase reference block of equal structural weight to Phase 0 — both declare a closed vocabulary before any generation phase executes. Read this block before Phase 1. Apply it to every violation diagnosis in every phase. Every prohibition site in this prompt cites this block by its full name: Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy. Four violation classes.

| Violation Class | Trigger Condition | Example in This Register |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Format | Cell value deviates from a stated vocabulary constraint (severity, dimension, type-class, or other field vocabulary) | Severity cell contains "Critical" instead of HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW |
| Schema | Row anatomy deviates from the Phase 0b field list — extra column added or required field omitted | "Notes" column added to Table 2 outside Phase 0b declaration |
| Boundary | Content violates a declared phase boundary constraint | HIGH-severity row added in Phase 2; Phase 1b entry revised during a Phase 2b repair loop |
| Quality | Prohibited phrase found in a Mitigation cell — vague language not replaced by a typed concrete action | "monitor closely" present in a Mitigation cell after Phase 2a scan |

This taxonomy is closed. No violation category outside this list may be named at any prohibition site.

Advance to Phase 1.

---

### Phase 1 — Table 1: Inertia Risk (Mandatory — Schema from Phase 0b — Never Suppressed)

The inertia risk is the risk that the status quo was sufficient and this feature was unnecessary. Produce a single-row table using the Table 1 Schema Extension declared in Phase 0b (7 fields). This table appears in all output regardless of any AMEND directive.

Populate each field per Phase 0b constraints. No new columns. No omitted fields.

---

### Phase 1b — HIGH-Seed Step (Seed ONE HIGH Row Per Active Dimension — Completes Before Phase 2)

Before any MEDIUM or LOW rows exist, seed the HIGH foundation of the register using the Table 2 Row Schema from Phase 0b.

For each active dimension in scope — all five (Technical, Market, Compliance, Dependency, Timeline) unless AMEND restricts the set — produce exactly one HIGH-severity row. Write only HIGH rows here. Do not write any MEDIUM or LOW rows in this step.

**Phase 1b completion gate:** Count active dimensions. Count HIGH rows produced here. They must match. If any active dimension lacks a HIGH row, add it before advancing. Do not proceed to Phase 2 with a gap.

Phase 2 inherits these seeded rows and expands around them. Phase 2b confirms the per-dimension HIGH coverage guaranteed here.

---

### Phase 2 — Table 2: Dimensional Risk Register (Schema from Phase 0b — Minimum 7 Rows)

**Add MEDIUM and LOW rows to the seeded HIGH rows from Phase 1b.** All active dimensions must be represented. HIGH rows from Phase 1b are already present — do not duplicate them. Add rows until the total Table 2 row count (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions) reaches **7 rows minimum**.

**Do not add HIGH-severity rows in Phase 2 — all HIGH coverage is provided exclusively by Phase 1b. Adding a HIGH-severity row here is a format violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy).**

Use the Table 2 Row Schema from Phase 0b. No columns beyond the Phase 0b field list. No field omissions.

Count total rows (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions). Minimum required: **7 rows**.

If fewer than 7 total rows:

→ **Repair Loop A** — Row-count deficit: Return to Phase 2. Add MEDIUM or LOW entries for under-populated dimensions until total count reaches 7. Re-confirm before Phase 2a.

Final row order across Phase 1b + Phase 2: HIGH rows first, MEDIUM second, LOW third.

---

### Phase 2a — Mitigation Quality Gate

Scan all Mitigation cells in Table 1 (Phase 1), Table 2 Phase 1b rows, and Table 2 Phase 2 rows for these prohibited phrases:

1. "monitor closely" / 2. "keep an eye on" / 3. "revisit later" / 4. "consider alternatives" / 5. "be careful" / 6. "watch for" / 7. "ensure adequate"

If any cell contains one of the seven phrases:

→ **Repair Loop B** — Quality violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy): Replace the prohibited phrase in the affected cell with a typed concrete action from the Phase 0 taxonomy. Key=value sub-field pairs required. Re-execute Phase 2a.

Phase 2a terminates when zero instances of all seven phrases are found in a full scan.

---

### Phase 2b — Type Diversity Audit (Standalone Phase — Do Not Merge with Any Other Step)

Count distinct Type-Class labels across Table 1 (Phase 1), Table 2 Phase 1b rows, and Table 2 Phase 2 rows. Minimum required: **3 distinct labels**.

**This audit does not repair per-dimension HIGH coverage (which Phase 1b guarantees) — its scope is type-class distribution only.** A deficit here means the register has type monoculture, not a HIGH coverage gap. **Do not revise Phase 1b entries or add HIGH rows to address a type-diversity deficit.**

If fewer than 3 distinct Type-Class labels:

→ **Repair Loop C** — Type-diversity deficit: Return to Phase 2. Revise mitigation entries — prioritize LOW and MEDIUM rows — until 3 distinct Type-Class labels are present. Re-execute Phase 2b.

Phase 2b terminates when count reaches 3 or greater. Record:

> **Type distribution**: Spike (N), Validate (N), Gate (N), Contract (N), Cut (N), Instrument (N)

---

### Phase 3 — Table 3: Risk Interdependencies (Minimum 3 Rows)

Produce a table titled **Risk Interdependencies** using the schema below:

| Column | Cell Constraint |
|--------|-----------------|
| From-Risk-ID | Risk-ID from Table 1 or Table 2 |
| To-Risk-ID | Risk-ID from Table 1 or Table 2 |
| Trigger Condition | Named activation event — IF [From-Risk activates by its stated condition]; this is a dedicated column, not embedded in severity cells |
| From-Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW — severity of To-Risk *before* From-Risk fires |
| To-Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW — severity of To-Risk *when* From-Risk fires |

From-Severity and To-Severity are each vocabulary-constrained to {HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW} — prose, blank, or compound values are format violations (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy). Trigger Condition is a discrete named field, not embedded in severity cells.

---

### Phase 4 — Interdependency Count Gate (Minimum 3 Rows)

Count rows in Phase 3. Minimum required: **3**.

If fewer than 3:

→ **Repair Loop D** — Interdependency-count deficit: Return to Phase 2. Add or decompose risk entries until the register supports 3 distinct compound-risk pairings. Re-execute Phase 3 and Phase 4.

Phase 4 terminates when Phase 3 contains at least 3 rows.

---

### Phase 5 — Final Output Assembly

Output in this order:

1. **AMEND Scope Declaration** (Phase 0a — if present; includes Active Dimensions and Suppressed Dimensions)
2. **Table 1** — Inertia Risk (7-column schema with Decision Window)
3. **Table 2** — Dimensional Risk Register (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions, HIGH rows first, all columns vocabulary-constrained)
4. **Table 3** — Risk Interdependencies (Trigger Condition + From-Severity + To-Severity columns)
5. **Type distribution** record from Phase 2b
