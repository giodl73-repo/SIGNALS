# mock-ns -- Round 18 Variations (rubric v18, C-46/C-47 targets)

Rubric: v18 (C-01 through C-47, 5 essential / 3 recommended / 39 aspirational, max 158).

New criteria in v18 (extracted from R17 scoring):

- **C-46** -- CONSTRAINT trailing-group as named intermediate failure form: the third discrete
  CONSTRAINT structural pattern. Types present but in a separate trailing clause rather than
  per-ID inline. Co-fires with C-44 for trailing-group; C-44 fires alone for step-IDs-only.

- **C-47** -- C-44 scope boundary + C-45 type-count cascade: two formalized rules. (1) C-44
  evaluates only IDs that ARE named -- collapsed S-3 with annotated {S-1, S-2, S-3} passes C-44.
  (2) C-45 FAIL removes S-3.1 and S-3.2 from the type count (5 -> 3), cascading C-21 FAIL +
  C-24 FAIL. C-15 survives at floor 3.

R17 confirmed scores under v18:

| Variation | Fails | v17 score | v18 score |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| V-01 (step-IDs-only) | C-15, C-21, C-24, C-44 | 142/154 | 148/158 |
| V-02 (trailing-group) | C-44, C-46 | 152/154 | 154/158 |
| V-03 (collapsed S-3, per-ID) | C-45, C-21, C-24 | 148/154 | 152/158 |
| V-04 (em-dash per-ID) | -- | 154/154 | 158/158 |
| V-05 (golden parenthetical) | -- | 154/154 | 158/158 |

Variation axes:

| Variation | Axis | Hypothesis |
|-----------|------|------------|
| V-01 | CONSTRAINT form: step-IDs-only (no annotations) | C-44 FAIL; C-15/C-21/C-24 co-fail (0 types named); C-46 PASS (no trailing group); C-47 PASS; score 148/158 |
| V-02 | CONSTRAINT annotation placement: trailing group | C-44 FAIL (types not per-ID); C-46 FAIL (trailing clause present); C-15/C-21/C-24 PASS (5 types present); C-47 PASS; score 154/158 |
| V-03 | CONSTRAINT S-3 granularity: collapsed + per-ID annotations | C-44 PASS (named IDs annotated); C-45 FAIL (S-3 collapsed); C-21/C-24 cascade FAIL; C-15 PASS (floor 3); C-46 PASS; C-47 PASS; score 152/158 |
| V-04 | CONSTRAINT per-ID em-dash co-location | C-44 PASS (em-dash = equivalent co-located form); C-45 PASS; all others pass; score 158/158 |
| V-05 | CONSTRAINT per-ID golden parenthetical | All pass; score 158/158 |

## V-01

**Axis: CONSTRAINT form -- step-IDs-only (no per-ID operation-type annotations)**
**Hypothesis: C-44 FAIL (step IDs present, zero per-ID annotations). C-15/C-21/C-24 co-fail (0 operation types named anywhere in CONSTRAINT). C-46 PASS (no trailing group). C-47 PASS. Expected score: 148/158.**

STEP P-0 -- CROSS-REFERENCE PROTOCOL

Token notation: bracket tokens encode step and row type. All tokens defined here.

Anti-bypass declaration (ABD): An executor who processes a bracket token without
performing Phase 2 (Steps 2a through 2d) has not satisfied this protocol.
Locate-only is a protocol failure. Anti-bypass echo rows at S-3 and S-4 echo this
declaration. [P-0:ABD] is registered as its own definition point -- encountering
[P-0:ABD] at an echo site requires Phase 1 lookup on [P-0:ABD] before processing.

  Abbreviation key: :CS = Cross-site reference row | :FC = Failure consequence row
                    :ABD = Anti-bypass declaration

  | Token     | Step | Row type                 | Paired token | Direction                |
  |-----------|------|--------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|
  | [S-3:CS]  | S-3  | Cross-site reference row | [S-4:FC]     | forward --> names S-4    |
  | [S-4:FC]  | S-4  | Failure consequence row  | [S-3:CS]     | <-- backward, names S-3  |
  | [P-0:ABD] | P-0  | Anti-bypass declaration  | (self)       | definition point         |

Lookup protocol -- two phases, both required before writing any bracket-token row:

  Phase 1 -- Locate: find the row by token name in the table above.
  Phase 2 -- Confirm:
    Step 2a: Read the Step cell.
    Step 2b: Read the Row type cell.
    Step 2c: Assert step name matches current step; row type matches current row role.
    Step 2d: Emit confirmation record (pre-filled at use site; fill Match only).
             DO NOT WRITE THE ROW until Steps 2a-2d are complete.

Do not re-establish this protocol in later steps.

STEP S-0 -- READ TOPICS.md

CONSTRAINT: Do not perform S-1, S-2, S-3.1, S-3.2, or S-3.3 until this step's emit is written.

Before any other step begins, this step emits the TOPICS.md status line.

Emit: > TOPICS.md: {found | not found}, tier: {tier}, compliance-tags: {tags | none},
        tier-source: {TOPICS.md | default-1 | --tier-override}

  | Field           | Resolution                                                                | Downstream-Action                                      |

  | tier            | TOPICS.md if found; 1 if not; --tier if provided                          | Consumed at S-3.3 (flag computation)                   |
  | compliance-tags | TOPICS.md if found; none if not                                           | Consumed at S-3.2 (compliance detection)               |
  | tier-source     | TOPICS.md if found and no override; default-1 if not; --tier-override     | Consumed at S-3.1; re-emitted as carry record before S-3.2 |

Only this step emits the TOPICS.md status line.

STEP S-5 -- FINALIZE

  S-5.0 -- PROPAGATION VERIFICATION
  Before S-5.1, verify each input-field row in the PROPAGATION table. Apply Scope-driven rule:
    - Scope=multi-step: confirm Downstream-Action acknowledges multi-step scope explicitly;
      emit MULTI-STEP-ACKNOWLEDGED.
    - Scope=single-step: check both conditions in the verification check table below;
      emit MATCH if both pass, MISMATCH if either fails.

  Verification check table (single-step fields):

  | Field           | Expected CONSTRAINT string              | Expected Downstream-Action string  |
  |-----------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
  | tier-source     | contains "S-3.1"                        | contains "Consumed at S-3.1"       |
  | compliance-tags | contains "S-3.2"                        | contains "Consumed at S-3.2"       |
  | tier            | contains "S-3.3"                        | contains "Consumed at S-3.3"       |

  The step emits:
    > PROPAGATION verified: topic [MULTI-STEP-ACKNOWLEDGED] | tier-source
        [MATCH | MISMATCH] | compliance-tags [MATCH | MISMATCH] | tier [MATCH | MISMATCH]

  If any single-step field returns MISMATCH:
    The step emits:
      > PROPAGATION MISMATCH: run halted -- repair CONSTRAINT block or
          Downstream-Action entries before continuing
    Stop. Do not execute S-5.1 through S-5.4.

  S-5.1 -- COUNT
  Emit: > Manifest complete: 3/3 sections | {COMPLETE | INCOMPLETE [missing: {list}]}

  S-5.2 -- ORDER
  Emit (after S-5.1, before S-5.3): > Section ordering: {IN-ORDER | REORDERED [reordered: {list}]}

  Emit (after S-5.2, before S-5.4):
    > Header: Category={CATEGORY} [S-2: MATCH | MISMATCH] | Flag={flag} [S-3: MATCH | MISMATCH]

STEP P-0 -- CROSS-REFERENCE PROTOCOL

Token notation: bracket tokens encode step and row type. All tokens defined here.

Anti-bypass declaration (ABD): An executor who processes a bracket token without
performing Phase 2 (Steps 2a through 2d) has not satisfied this protocol.
Locate-only is a protocol failure. Anti-bypass echo rows at S-3 and S-4 echo this
declaration. [P-0:ABD] is registered as its own definition point -- encountering
[P-0:ABD] at an echo site requires Phase 1 lookup on [P-0:ABD] before processing.

  Abbreviation key: :CS = Cross-site reference row | :FC = Failure consequence row
                    :ABD = Anti-bypass declaration

  | Token     | Step | Row type                 | Paired token | Direction                |
  |-----------|------|--------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|
  | [S-3:CS]  | S-3  | Cross-site reference row | [S-4:FC]     | forward --> names S-4    |
  | [S-4:FC]  | S-4  | Failure consequence row  | [S-3:CS]     | <-- backward, names S-3  |
  | [P-0:ABD] | P-0  | Anti-bypass declaration  | (self)       | definition point         |

Lookup protocol -- two phases, both required before writing any bracket-token row:

  Phase 1 -- Locate: find the row by token name in the table above.
  Phase 2 -- Confirm:
    Step 2a: Read the Step cell.
    Step 2b: Read the Row type cell.
    Step 2c: Assert step name matches current step; row type matches current row role.
    Step 2d: Emit confirmation record (pre-filled at use site; fill Match only).
             DO NOT WRITE THE ROW until Steps 2a-2d are complete.

Do not re-establish this protocol in later steps.

STEP S-0 -- READ TOPICS.md

CONSTRAINT: Do not perform S-1, S-2, S-3.1, S-3.2, or S-3.3 until this step's emit is written. Operations blocked: skill selection, category lookup, carry, compliance detection, flag computation.

Before any other step begins, this step emits the TOPICS.md status line.

Emit: > TOPICS.md: {found | not found}, tier: {tier}, compliance-tags: {tags | none},
        tier-source: {TOPICS.md | default-1 | --tier-override}

  | Field           | Resolution                                                                | Downstream-Action                                      |

  | topic           | Value from input argument                                                 | Consumed across all steps; no single sub-step anchor   |
  | tier            | TOPICS.md if found; 1 if not; --tier if provided                          | Consumed at S-3.3 (flag computation)                   |
  | compliance-tags | TOPICS.md if found; none if not                                           | Consumed at S-3.2 (compliance detection)               |
  | tier-source     | TOPICS.md if found and no override; default-1 if not; --tier-override     | Consumed at S-3.1; re-emitted as carry record before S-3.2 |

Only this step emits the TOPICS.md status line.

      emit MULTI-STEP-ACKNOWLEDGED.
    - Scope=single-step: check both conditions in the verification check table below;
      emit MATCH if both pass, MISMATCH if either fails.

  Verification check table (single-step fields):

  | Field           | Expected CONSTRAINT string              | Expected Downstream-Action string  |
  |-----------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
  | tier-source     | contains "S-3.1"                        | contains "Consumed at S-3.1"       |
  | compliance-tags | contains "S-3.2"                        | contains "Consumed at S-3.2"       |
  | tier            | contains "S-3.3"                        | contains "Consumed at S-3.3"       |

  The step emits:
    > PROPAGATION verified: topic [MULTI-STEP-ACKNOWLEDGED] | tier-source
        [MATCH | MISMATCH] | compliance-tags [MATCH | MISMATCH] | tier [MATCH | MISMATCH]

  If any single-step field returns MISMATCH:
    The step emits:
      > PROPAGATION MISMATCH: run halted -- repair CONSTRAINT block or
          Downstream-Action entries before continuing
    Stop. Do not execute S-5.1 through S-5.4.

**Axis: CONSTRAINT S-3 granularity -- collapsed S-3 reference with per-ID annotations for all named IDs**
**Hypothesis: C-44 PASS (S-1, S-2, S-3 each carry per-ID annotation; C-44 evaluates named IDs only). C-45 FAIL (S-3 collapsed -- S-3.1/S-3.2/S-3.3 not separately enumerated). C-45 cascade: type count 5 -> 3 (S-3.1 carry + S-3.2 compliance dropped); C-21 FAIL + C-24 FAIL. C-15 PASS (floor 3). C-46 PASS (no trailing group). C-47 PASS (scope boundary + cascade correctly modeled). Expected score: 152/158.**

STEP P-0 -- CROSS-REFERENCE PROTOCOL

Token notation: bracket tokens encode step and row type. All tokens defined here.

Anti-bypass declaration (ABD): An executor who processes a bracket token without
performing Phase 2 (Steps 2a through 2d) has not satisfied this protocol.
Locate-only is a protocol failure. Anti-bypass echo rows at S-3 and S-4 echo this
declaration. [P-0:ABD] is registered as its own definition point -- encountering
[P-0:ABD] at an echo site requires Phase 1 lookup on [P-0:ABD] before processing.

  Abbreviation key: :CS = Cross-site reference row | :FC = Failure consequence row
                    :ABD = Anti-bypass declaration

  | Token     | Step | Row type                 | Paired token | Direction                |
  |-----------|------|--------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|
  | [S-3:CS]  | S-3  | Cross-site reference row | [S-4:FC]     | forward --> names S-4    |
  | [S-4:FC]  | S-4  | Failure consequence row  | [S-3:CS]     | <-- backward, names S-3  |
  | [P-0:ABD] | P-0  | Anti-bypass declaration  | (self)       | definition point         |

Lookup protocol -- two phases, both required before writing any bracket-token row:

  Phase 1 -- Locate: find the row by token name in the table above.
  Phase 2 -- Confirm:
    Step 2a: Read the Step cell.
    Step 2b: Read the Row type cell.
    Step 2c: Assert step name matches current step; row type matches current row role.
    Step 2d: Emit confirmation record (pre-filled at use site; fill Match only).
             DO NOT WRITE THE ROW until Steps 2a-2d are complete.

Do not re-establish this protocol in later steps.

STEP S-0 -- READ TOPICS.md

CONSTRAINT: Do not perform S-1 (skill selection), S-2 (category lookup), or S-3 (flag computation) until this step's emit is written.

Before any other step begins, this step emits the TOPICS.md status line.

Emit: > TOPICS.md: {found | not found}, tier: {tier}, compliance-tags: {tags | none},
        tier-source: {TOPICS.md | default-1 | --tier-override}

  | Field           | Resolution                                                                | Downstream-Action                                      |

  | tier            | TOPICS.md if found; 1 if not; --tier if provided                          | Consumed at S-3.3 (flag computation)                   |
  | compliance-tags | TOPICS.md if found; none if not                                           | Consumed at S-3.2 (compliance detection)               |
  | tier-source     | TOPICS.md if found and no override; default-1 if not; --tier-override     | Consumed at S-3.1; re-emitted as carry record before S-3.2 |

Only this step emits the TOPICS.md status line.

STEP P-0 -- CROSS-REFERENCE PROTOCOL

Token notation: bracket tokens encode step and row type. All tokens defined here.

Anti-bypass declaration (ABD): An executor who processes a bracket token without
performing Phase 2 (Steps 2a through 2d) has not satisfied this protocol.
Locate-only is a protocol failure. Anti-bypass echo rows at S-3 and S-4 echo this
declaration. [P-0:ABD] is registered as its own definition point -- encountering
[P-0:ABD] at an echo site requires Phase 1 lookup on [P-0:ABD] before processing.

  Abbreviation key: :CS = Cross-site reference row | :FC = Failure consequence row
                    :ABD = Anti-bypass declaration

  | Token     | Step | Row type                 | Paired token | Direction                |
  |-----------|------|--------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|
  | [S-3:CS]  | S-3  | Cross-site reference row | [S-4:FC]     | forward --> names S-4    |
  | [S-4:FC]  | S-4  | Failure consequence row  | [S-3:CS]     | <-- backward, names S-3  |
  | [P-0:ABD] | P-0  | Anti-bypass declaration  | (self)       | definition point         |

Lookup protocol -- two phases, both required before writing any bracket-token row:

  Phase 1 -- Locate: find the row by token name in the table above.
  Phase 2 -- Confirm:
    Step 2a: Read the Step cell.
    Step 2b: Read the Row type cell.
    Step 2c: Assert step name matches current step; row type matches current row role.
    Step 2d: Emit confirmation record (pre-filled at use site; fill Match only).
             DO NOT WRITE THE ROW until Steps 2a-2d are complete.

Do not re-establish this protocol in later steps.

STEP S-0 -- READ TOPICS.md

CONSTRAINT: Do not perform S-1 -- skill selection, S-2 -- category lookup, S-3.1 -- carry, S-3.2 -- compliance detection, or S-3.3 -- flag computation until this step's emit is written.

Before any other step begins, this step emits the TOPICS.md status line.

Emit: > TOPICS.md: {found | not found}, tier: {tier}, compliance-tags: {tags | none},
        tier-source: {TOPICS.md | default-1 | --tier-override}

  | Field           | Resolution                                                                | Downstream-Action                                      |

  | tier            | TOPICS.md if found; 1 if not; --tier if provided                          | Consumed at S-3.3 (flag computation)                   |
  | compliance-tags | TOPICS.md if found; none if not                                           | Consumed at S-3.2 (compliance detection)               |
  | tier-source     | TOPICS.md if found and no override; default-1 if not; --tier-override     | Consumed at S-3.1; re-emitted as carry record before S-3.2 |

Only this step emits the TOPICS.md status line.

STEP P-0 -- CROSS-REFERENCE PROTOCOL

Token notation: bracket tokens encode step and row type. All tokens defined here.

Anti-bypass declaration (ABD): An executor who processes a bracket token without
performing Phase 2 (Steps 2a through 2d) has not satisfied this protocol.
Locate-only is a protocol failure. Anti-bypass echo rows at S-3 and S-4 echo this
declaration. [P-0:ABD] is registered as its own definition point -- encountering
[P-0:ABD] at an echo site requires Phase 1 lookup on [P-0:ABD] before processing.

  Abbreviation key: :CS = Cross-site reference row | :FC = Failure consequence row
                    :ABD = Anti-bypass declaration

  | Token     | Step | Row type                 | Paired token | Direction                |
  |-----------|------|--------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|
  | [S-3:CS]  | S-3  | Cross-site reference row | [S-4:FC]     | forward --> names S-4    |
  | [S-4:FC]  | S-4  | Failure consequence row  | [S-3:CS]     | <-- backward, names S-3  |
  | [P-0:ABD] | P-0  | Anti-bypass declaration  | (self)       | definition point         |

Lookup protocol -- two phases, both required before writing any bracket-token row:

  Phase 1 -- Locate: find the row by token name in the table above.
  Phase 2 -- Confirm:
    Step 2a: Read the Step cell.
    Step 2b: Read the Row type cell.
    Step 2c: Assert step name matches current step; row type matches current row role.
    Step 2d: Emit confirmation record (pre-filled at use site; fill Match only).
             DO NOT WRITE THE ROW until Steps 2a-2d are complete.

Do not re-establish this protocol in later steps.

STEP S-0 -- READ TOPICS.md

CONSTRAINT: Do not perform S-1 (skill selection), S-2 (category lookup), S-3.1 (carry), S-3.2 (compliance detection), or S-3.3 (flag computation) until this step's emit is written.

Before any other step begins, this step emits the TOPICS.md status line.

Emit: > TOPICS.md: {found | not found}, tier: {tier}, compliance-tags: {tags | none},
        tier-source: {TOPICS.md | default-1 | --tier-override}

  | Field           | Resolution                                                                | Downstream-Action                                      |

  | tier            | TOPICS.md if found; 1 if not; --tier if provided                          | Consumed at S-3.3 (flag computation)                   |
  | compliance-tags | TOPICS.md if found; none if not                                           | Consumed at S-3.2 (compliance detection)               |
  | tier-source     | TOPICS.md if found and no override; default-1 if not; --tier-override     | Consumed at S-3.1; re-emitted as carry record before S-3.2 |

Only this step emits the TOPICS.md status line.

          Downstream-Action entries before continuing
    Stop. Do not execute S-5.1 through S-5.4.

  S-5.1 -- COUNT
  Emit: > Manifest complete: 3/3 sections | {COMPLETE | INCOMPLETE [missing: {list}]}

  S-5.2 -- ORDER
  Emit (after S-5.1, before S-5.3): > Section ordering: {IN-ORDER | REORDERED [reordered: {list}]}
