## Context: what informed this round

R8 V-05 achieved 100.00 under v9: all 22/22 aspirational criteria pass. The v9 rubric
introduced C-28 (FULL MODE emit-order check), C-29 (FILTER MODE format check), and C-30
(BARE MODE slash-strip worked examples). All three were present in R8 V-05, confirming it
as the new universal baseline.

Under v9 the retroactive R8 leaderboard is:

| V | C-28 | C-29 | C-30 | Composite |
|---|------|------|------|-----------|
| **V-05** | PASS | PASS | PASS | **100.00** |
| V-04 | PASS | PASS | FAIL | 99.55 |
| V-01 | PASS | FAIL | FAIL | 99.09 |
| V-02 | FAIL | PASS | FAIL | 99.09 |
| V-03 | FAIL | FAIL | PASS | 99.09 |

R9 goal: **excellence-signal discovery beyond the current ceiling.** R8 V-05 satisfies
every criterion in v9. The question is: what failure modes remain that V-05 does not address?
Three structural gaps identified from analysis of R8 V-05:

- **Axis M**: COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE has 3 checks (completeness, count, order).
  COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE has 3 checks (scope, count, format). COMPLIANCE GATE --
  BARE MODE has 2 checks (format, count). FULL MODE is the only mode without an explicit
  format-compliance check in its gate. FILTER gained its format check in C-29. BARE has a
  format check as Check 1. FULL's gate verifies namespace presence, per-namespace counts,
  and sequence, but does not verify that each section follows SECTION FORMAT (header +
  skill lines + dispatch footer). A model could emit all 12 namespaces in correct count
  and order but with malformed sections -- e.g., headers missing `--` separators, footers
  omitted -- and the FULL compliance gate would still pass. Adding Check 4 (format) to
  COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE closes the asymmetry: all three modes then have an explicit
  format check in their compliance gate.

- **Axis N**: COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE has Check 1 (format) and Check 2 (count).
  C-21 anchors only the first and last entries ("Begin with scout-competitors. End with
  org-committee"). The interior 59 entries have no order verification at the compliance gate
  level. COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE has Check 3 (order) for the 12 section sequence.
  BARE MODE has no equivalent. A model could emit 61 correctly formatted lines but with
  namespace groups reordered (e.g., org-* first, scout-* last) and both Check 1 and Check 2
  would still pass. Adding Check 3 (order) to COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE -- verifying
  canonical namespace group sequence across all 61 lines -- creates order-check symmetry
  between FULL (Check 3) and BARE (new Check 3).

- **Axis O**: PARSE MODE rule 3 is: "FILTER if `<namespace>` is a canonical namespace;
  FULL otherwise." The "FULL otherwise" branch has a guard ("If the word after /signal is
  not in this list, emit FULL") but no worked example. The most likely mistake: a user types
  `/signal review-code` (a sub-skill name, not a namespace). The model must infer from the
  rule that "review-code" is not canonical and route to FULL. This is the same gap C-16
  closed for alignment and C-30 closed for slash-strip: rule alone vs. rule + pattern-copy
  example. Adding two worked examples (sub-skill-name argument; arbitrary string) makes the
  "FULL otherwise" path directly copyable.

All five R9 variations carry the full R8 V-05 mechanism set:
- Catalog-first ordering (C-17); active transcription gate with counted acknowledgment (C-22, C-23, C-26)
- Bare-mode count gate with per-namespace breakdown (C-18); canonical-namespace guard (C-19)
- Compliance gates with restart triggers for all three modes (C-14); filter-mode count gate (C-20)
- Bare order anchors: Begin with scout-competitors, End with org-committee (C-21)
- Symmetric mode completeness -- all three paths verified (C-24)
- FULL MODE compliance gate: completeness + count + order (C-25, C-28)
- FILTER MODE compliance gate: scope + count + format (C-20, C-29)
- BARE MODE compliance gate: format + count (C-18)
- Per-section count self-check in SECTION FORMAT (C-27)
- Slash-strip transformation examples (C-30)
- Precomputed width table with per-row example pad (C-15, C-16)
- Domain noun table (C-11); format consistency (C-13); accurate skill counts (C-06)
- Dispatch footers (C-07); column alignment (C-12)

## SPREAD-DESIGN PLAN

| Variation | Axis | Source Signal | Target Criteria | Predicted |
|-----------|------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|
| V-01 | Axis M single: FULL MODE format check (Check 4) | Structural gap: FILTER has Check 3 (format); BARE has Check 1 (format); FULL has no format check in its gate. Add Check 4 to COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE: SECTION FORMAT compliance per section with restart. | C-31 (predicted) | 100.00 |
| V-02 | Axis N single: BARE MODE interior-order check (Check 3) | Structural gap: FULL has Check 3 (order) for section sequence; BARE has only end-anchors (C-21) but no order gate check. Add Check 3 to COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE: canonical namespace group order verified, restart on violation. | C-32 (predicted) | 100.00 |
| V-03 | Axis O single: PARSE MODE disambiguation worked examples | Structural gap: "FULL otherwise" branch has no worked example. A user typing a sub-skill name (e.g., /signal review-code) must be handled by rule-inference alone. Add two worked examples to PARSE MODE. | C-33 (predicted) | 100.00 |
| V-04 | Axes M+N combined | FULL MODE format check + BARE MODE order check. Both gate additions without parse-mode example. | C-31+C-32 (predicted) | 100.00 |
| V-05 | Axes M+N+O: triple convergence | All three axes applied to R8 V-05 base. Full gate symmetry across all three modes + parse-mode disambiguation examples. | C-31+C-32+C-33 (predicted) | 100.00 |

All five variations are predicted to score 100.00 under v9 since all carry the full R8
V-05 mechanism set. The axes probe for excellence signals beyond the current ceiling.

## V-01 -- Single-axis: FULL MODE Format Check (Axis M)

**Axis**: COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE upgraded with Check 4 (format): SECTION FORMAT
compliance verified per section before FULL output is emitted, with restart if any section
is malformed.
**Hypothesis**: R8 V-05's COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE has three checks: completeness (12
namespaces present), count (canonical sub-skill counts per section), and order (canonical
sequence). None of the three checks verifies that each section follows SECTION FORMAT.
COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE gained Check 3 (format) in C-29, requiring header line form,
sub-skill lines with `->` separator, and dispatch footer. COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE has
Check 1 (format) as its primary check. FULL MODE is the only mode whose compliance gate
contains no format verification. A model could emit all 12 namespaces in correct count and
order but with malformed sections -- e.g., a header missing `--` separators, sub-skill lines
without `->`, or a section with no dispatch footer -- and the FULL compliance gate would pass
on all three existing checks. Adding Check 4 (format) closes this asymmetry: all three modes
then have an explicit format check in their compliance gate.
No change to NAMESPACE CATALOG, BARE MODE gate, FILTER MODE gate, or PARSE MODE.

PARSE MODE:

  /signal --bare       -> BARE (command names only, one per line, no prose)
  /signal <namespace>  -> FILTER if <namespace> is a canonical namespace; FULL otherwise
  anything else        -> FULL

Canonical namespaces (exactly these 12): scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove,
listen, program, topic, quest, mock, org.
If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

Per-section count self-check: before emitting the dispatch footer for each namespace
section, verify: the number of sub-skill lines above the footer equals the canonical
count for that namespace (scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9,
listen=3, program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4) AND equals the N stated in the
section header. If either count differs, restart the section from its header.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE (precomputed -- do not recount)

  namespace  longest command name        width  example pad

  org        /org-committee                14   /org-roles (10) needs 5 spaces

DOMAIN NOUN TABLE

Replace <DOMAIN-NOUN> in each footer with the exact noun listed here.
Do not use a generic placeholder. Do not omit the noun.

  scout    -> research goal
  draft    -> draft artifact
  review   -> artifact
  flow     -> process scenario
  trace    -> system
  prove    -> hypothesis
  listen   -> feature
  program  -> program
  topic    -> topic management need
  quest    -> optimization goal
  mock     -> coverage gap
  org      -> organizational need

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE

Before emitting FULL output, run all four checks:
  Check 1 (completeness): Does your output include sections for all 12 canonical
    namespaces: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic,
    quest, mock, org?
    If any namespace is absent -- MODE: FULL is incomplete. Restart.
  Check 2 (count): Does each namespace section contain exactly the canonical number
    of sub-skills?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If any section's count differs -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are namespace sections emitted in canonical order?
    Canonical order: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program,
    topic, quest, mock, org. (First section: scout. Last section: org.)
    If any section appears out of canonical sequence -- order violated. Restart.
  Check 4 (format): Does each namespace section follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Required per section: (1) a header line in the form "- /<namespace> -- <purpose> --
    <N> skills", (2) sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator, (3) a dispatch
    footer in the form "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>...".
    If any section is missing a required element or has a malformed element --
    FULL format violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run both checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (scope): Does your output include any command from a namespace other than
    the one requested?
    If yes -- MODE: FILTER scope is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly the canonical count of skills
    for the requested namespace?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated in the filter output. Restart.
  Check 3 (format): Does the filter output follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Required elements: (1) a header line in the form "- /<namespace> -- <purpose> --
    <N> skills", (2) sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator, (3) a dispatch
    footer in the form "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>...".
    If any required element is absent or malformed -- FILTER output format violated. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee.

Slash-strip transformation: catalog entries carry a leading `/`. Strip it.
  `/scout-competitors` becomes `scout-competitors`  (first entry)
  `/org-committee`     becomes `org-committee`      (last entry)
Remove only the leading `/`. No other characters change.
```

## V-02 -- Single-axis: BARE MODE Interior-Order Check (Axis N)

**Axis**: COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE upgraded with Check 3 (order): canonical namespace
group sequence verified before bare output is emitted, with restart if violated.
**Hypothesis**: R8 V-05's BARE MODE compliance gate has Check 1 (format) and Check 2 (count).
C-21 ("Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee") anchors the first and last
entries but does not verify the interior 59 entries. COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE has Check 3
(order) verifying canonical section sequence. BARE MODE has no equivalent at the gate level.
A model could emit 61 lines with no slashes and correct count but with namespace groups
reordered -- e.g., all org-* names first, scout-* names last -- and both Check 1 and Check 2
would still pass. Adding Check 3 (order) to COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE creates order-check
symmetry between FULL (Check 3) and BARE (new Check 3). The end-anchors become one
manifestation of the order requirement; Check 3 enforces the complete interior sequence.
No change to NAMESPACE CATALOG, COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE, FILTER MODE gate, or PARSE MODE.

/quest-golden  -> find the golden prompt through systematic variation and scoring

Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your optimization goal and the most relevant quest skill will run.

- /mock -- Mock namespace -- 3 skills for synthetic signal generation

/mock-all    -> synthetic signal artifacts for all 9 namespaces with coverage picture
/mock-ns     -> mock artifact for a single namespace with category annotation
/mock-review -> coverage review writing MOCK-ACCEPTED or REAL-REQUIRED per namespace

Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your coverage gap and the most relevant mock skill will run.

- /org -- Org namespace -- 4 skills for organizational simulation

/org-roles      -> typed role registry with orientation, lens, and expertise
/org-chart      -> org structure with areas, committees, and operating rhythms
/org-review     -> full org review running artifact through all relevant roles
/org-committee  -> committee meeting simulation for ROB, shiproom, or architecture board

Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your organizational need and the most relevant skill will run.

PARSE MODE:
  /signal              -> FULL (all 12 namespaces)
  /signal --bare       -> BARE (command names only, one per line, no prose)
  /signal <namespace>  -> FILTER if <namespace> is a canonical namespace; FULL otherwise
  anything else        -> FULL

Canonical namespaces (exactly these 12): scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove,
listen, program, topic, quest, mock, org.
If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

Per-section count self-check: before emitting the dispatch footer for each namespace
section, verify: the number of sub-skill lines above the footer equals the canonical
count for that namespace (scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9,
listen=3, program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4) AND equals the N stated in the
section header. If either count differs, restart the section from its header.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE (precomputed -- do not recount)

  namespace  longest command name        width  example pad
  ---------  -------------------------  -----  -----------
  scout      /scout-stakeholders           19   /scout-naming (13) needs 7 spaces

DOMAIN NOUN TABLE

Replace <DOMAIN-NOUN> in each footer with the exact noun listed here.
Do not use a generic placeholder. Do not omit the noun.

  scout    -> research goal
  draft    -> draft artifact
  review   -> artifact
  flow     -> process scenario
  trace    -> system
  prove    -> hypothesis
  listen   -> feature
  program  -> program
  topic    -> topic management need
  quest    -> optimization goal
  mock     -> coverage gap
  org      -> organizational need

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE

Before emitting FULL output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (completeness): Does your output include sections for all 12 canonical
    namespaces: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic,
    quest, mock, org?
    If any namespace is absent -- MODE: FULL is incomplete. Restart.
  Check 2 (count): Does each namespace section contain exactly the canonical number
    of sub-skills?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If any section's count differs -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are namespace sections emitted in canonical order?
    Canonical order: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program,
    topic, quest, mock, org. (First section: scout. Last section: org.)
    If any section appears out of canonical sequence -- order violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are names emitted in canonical namespace group order?
    Canonical sequence: first 8 lines are scout-* names, next 4 are draft-* names,
    next 4 are review-* names, next 7 are flow-* names, next 7 are trace-* names,
    next 9 are prove-* names, next 3 are listen-* names, next 2 are program entries,
    next 6 are topic-* names, next 4 are quest-* names, next 3 are mock-* names,
    last 4 are org-* names.
    If any name appears before its namespace group's turn in the canonical sequence --
    BARE order violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (scope): Does your output include any command from a namespace other than
    the one requested?
    If yes -- MODE: FILTER scope is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly the canonical count of skills
    for the requested namespace?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated in the filter output. Restart.
  Check 3 (format): Does the filter output follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Required elements: (1) a header line in the form "- /<namespace> -- <purpose> --
    <N> skills", (2) sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator, (3) a dispatch
    footer in the form "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>...".
    If any required element is absent or malformed -- FILTER output format violated. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee.

Slash-strip transformation: catalog entries carry a leading `/`. Strip it.
  `/scout-competitors` becomes `scout-competitors`  (first entry)
  `/org-committee`     becomes `org-committee`      (last entry)
Remove only the leading `/`. No other characters change.
```

## V-03 -- Single-axis: PARSE MODE Disambiguation Worked Examples (Axis O)

**Axis**: PARSE MODE upgraded with two worked examples for the "FULL otherwise" branch,
covering a sub-skill-name argument and an arbitrary non-namespace argument.
**Hypothesis**: R8 V-05's PARSE MODE rule 3 states: "`/signal <namespace>` -> FILTER if
`<namespace>` is a canonical namespace; FULL otherwise." The guard "If the word after
/signal is not in this list, emit FULL" requires the model to infer the output path for
a specific failure case: a user who types `/signal review-code` (a sub-skill name, not a
namespace). The model must recognize "review-code" is not in the canonical namespace list
and route to FULL. No worked example confirms this inference. This is structurally the
same gap C-16 closed for alignment (rule without example) and C-30 closed for slash-strip
(prohibition without transformation example). Adding two examples -- sub-skill-name case
and arbitrary string case -- makes the "FULL otherwise" path directly copyable.
No change to NAMESPACE CATALOG, COMPLIANCE GATE sections, or BARE MODE.

```
The user wants the Signal command index. Show them what is available so they can find the right skill.

NAMESPACE CATALOG -- TRANSCRIPTION GATE

  anything else        -> FULL

Canonical namespaces (exactly these 12): scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove,

If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.
  Example: `/signal review-code` -- "review-code" is not a canonical namespace -- emit FULL.
  Example: `/signal my-feature`  -- "my-feature" is not a canonical namespace  -- emit FULL.

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

Per-section count self-check: before emitting the dispatch footer for each namespace
section, verify: the number of sub-skill lines above the footer equals the canonical

section header. If either count differs, restart the section from its header.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

## V-04 -- Combined: Axes M+N (FULL MODE Format Check + BARE MODE Interior-Order Check)

**Axis**: COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE upgraded with Check 4 (format) AND COMPLIANCE GATE --
BARE MODE upgraded with Check 3 (order). Both gate additions without parse-mode examples.
**Hypothesis**: Axis M and Axis N address structural gaps in two different compliance gates.
M adds a format check to FULL (the only mode without one). N adds an order check to BARE
(matching the order check already in FULL). Neither modifies the same gate. No interaction
effects predicted -- FULL and BARE are mutually exclusive output paths. V-05 adds O to
confirm parse-mode disambiguation operates independently.

PARSE MODE:
  /signal              -> FULL (all 12 namespaces)
  /signal --bare       -> BARE (command names only, one per line, no prose)
  /signal <namespace>  -> FILTER if <namespace> is a canonical namespace; FULL otherwise
  anything else        -> FULL

Canonical namespaces (exactly these 12): scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove,
listen, program, topic, quest, mock, org.
If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

Per-section count self-check: before emitting the dispatch footer for each namespace
section, verify: the number of sub-skill lines above the footer equals the canonical
count for that namespace (scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9,
listen=3, program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4) AND equals the N stated in the
section header. If either count differs, restart the section from its header.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE (precomputed -- do not recount)

  namespace  longest command name        width  example pad
  ---------  -------------------------  -----  -----------
  scout      /scout-stakeholders           19   /scout-naming (13) needs 7 spaces

  org        /org-committee                14   /org-roles (10) needs 5 spaces

DOMAIN NOUN TABLE

Replace <DOMAIN-NOUN> in each footer with the exact noun listed here.
Do not use a generic placeholder. Do not omit the noun.

  scout    -> research goal
  draft    -> draft artifact
  review   -> artifact
  flow     -> process scenario
  trace    -> system
  prove    -> hypothesis
  listen   -> feature
  program  -> program
  topic    -> topic management need
  quest    -> optimization goal
  mock     -> coverage gap
  org      -> organizational need

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE

Before emitting FULL output, run all four checks:
  Check 1 (completeness): Does your output include sections for all 12 canonical
    namespaces: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic,
    quest, mock, org?
    If any namespace is absent -- MODE: FULL is incomplete. Restart.
  Check 2 (count): Does each namespace section contain exactly the canonical number
    of sub-skills?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If any section's count differs -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are namespace sections emitted in canonical order?
    Canonical order: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program,
    topic, quest, mock, org. (First section: scout. Last section: org.)
    If any section appears out of canonical sequence -- order violated. Restart.
  Check 4 (format): Does each namespace section follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Required per section: (1) a header line in the form "- /<namespace> -- <purpose> --
    <N> skills", (2) sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator, (3) a dispatch
    footer in the form "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>...".
    If any section is missing a required element or has a malformed element --
    FULL format violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are names emitted in canonical namespace group order?
    Canonical sequence: first 8 lines are scout-* names, next 4 are draft-* names,
    next 4 are review-* names, next 7 are flow-* names, next 7 are trace-* names,
    next 9 are prove-* names, next 3 are listen-* names, next 2 are program entries,
    next 6 are topic-* names, next 4 are quest-* names, next 3 are mock-* names,
    last 4 are org-* names.
    If any name appears before its namespace group's turn in the canonical sequence --
    BARE order violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (scope): Does your output include any command from a namespace other than
    the one requested?
    If yes -- MODE: FILTER scope is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly the canonical count of skills
    for the requested namespace?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated in the filter output. Restart.
  Check 3 (format): Does the filter output follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Required elements: (1) a header line in the form "- /<namespace> -- <purpose> --
    <N> skills", (2) sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator, (3) a dispatch
    footer in the form "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>...".
    If any required element is absent or malformed -- FILTER output format violated. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee.

Slash-strip transformation: catalog entries carry a leading `/`. Strip it.
  `/scout-competitors` becomes `scout-competitors`  (first entry)
  `/org-committee`     becomes `org-committee`      (last entry)
Remove only the leading `/`. No other characters change.
```

## V-05 -- Triple Convergence: Axes M+N+O (Golden Target)

**Axis**: All three R9 axes combined in the R8 V-05 base.
**Hypothesis**: Axis M (FULL MODE format check), Axis N (BARE MODE interior-order check),
and Axis O (PARSE MODE disambiguation examples) address three structurally independent
aspects of output correctness:
- M: FULL mode, compliance gate level, format verification (new Check 4)
- N: BARE mode, compliance gate level, interior sequence verification (new Check 3)
- O: PARSE mode, dispatch rule level, "FULL otherwise" worked-example disambiguation

None modifies the same section or mechanism as another. Each is independently
isolation-tested in V-01/V-02/V-03. M+N combination confirmed in V-04. Adding O to the
M+N base produces triple convergence.

The three changes from R8 V-05 to R9 V-05:
1. COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE: add Check 4 (format): SECTION FORMAT compliance per
   section verified, restart if any section malformed (Axis M)
2. COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE: add Check 3 (order): canonical namespace group sequence
   verified, restart if any name appears before its group's turn (Axis N)
3. PARSE MODE: add two worked examples for the "FULL otherwise" branch
   (`/signal review-code` -> FULL; `/signal my-feature` -> FULL) (Axis O)

```
The user wants the Signal command index. Show them what is available so they can find the right skill.

NAMESPACE CATALOG -- TRANSCRIPTION GATE
Before transcribing: confirm you have read all 61 entries across the 12 namespace
sections below (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61). You will emit each entry
character-for-character. The catalog below IS the output for FULL and FILTER modes.
Do not paraphrase, condense, reorder, or reconstruct from memory. Any deviation from
the catalog text is an output failure, not an acceptable approximation.

  Example: `/signal my-feature`  -- "my-feature" is not a canonical namespace  -- emit FULL.

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

Per-section count self-check: before emitting the dispatch footer for each namespace
section, verify: the number of sub-skill lines above the footer equals the canonical
count for that namespace (scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9,
listen=3, program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4) AND equals the N stated in the
section header. If either count differs, restart the section from its header.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE

Before emitting FULL output, run all four checks:
  Check 1 (completeness): Does your output include sections for all 12 canonical
    namespaces: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic,
    quest, mock, org?
    If any namespace is absent -- MODE: FULL is incomplete. Restart.
  Check 2 (count): Does each namespace section contain exactly the canonical number
    of sub-skills?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If any section's count differs -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are namespace sections emitted in canonical order?
    Canonical order: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program,
    topic, quest, mock, org. (First section: scout. Last section: org.)
    If any section appears out of canonical sequence -- order violated. Restart.
  Check 4 (format): Does each namespace section follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Required per section: (1) a header line in the form "- /<namespace> -- <purpose> --
    <N> skills", (2) sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator, (3) a dispatch
    footer in the form "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>...".
    If any section is missing a required element or has a malformed element --
    FULL format violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are names emitted in canonical namespace group order?
    Canonical sequence: first 8 lines are scout-* names, next 4 are draft-* names,
    next 4 are review-* names, next 7 are flow-* names, next 7 are trace-* names,
    next 9 are prove-* names, next 3 are listen-* names, next 2 are program entries,
    next 6 are topic-* names, next 4 are quest-* names, next 3 are mock-* names,
    last 4 are org-* names.
    If any name appears before its namespace group's turn in the canonical sequence --
    BARE order violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (scope): Does your output include any command from a namespace other than
    the one requested?
    If yes -- MODE: FILTER scope is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly the canonical count of skills
    for the requested namespace?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated in the filter output. Restart.
  Check 3 (format): Does the filter output follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Required elements: (1) a header line in the form "- /<namespace> -- <purpose> --
    <N> skills", (2) sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator, (3) a dispatch
    footer in the form "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>...".
    If any required element is absent or malformed -- FILTER output format violated. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee.

Slash-strip transformation: catalog entries carry a leading `/`. Strip it.
  `/scout-competitors` becomes `scout-competitors`  (first entry)
  `/org-committee`     becomes `org-committee`      (last entry)
Remove only the leading `/`. No other characters change.
```
