  v12 adds C-27 (schema column header and exit criterion field name are lexically
  identical -- R11 V-01 failure: column renamed to "Consequence if unchanged" but
  exit criterion not updated, producing C-26=0 and C-27=0) and C-28 (dual-site
  blocking enforcement -- preamble before defeat assessment table guards row entry;
  exit criterion guards phase departure; each site self-contained without delegating
  to the other). Formula denominator changes to 40 (20 aspirational x 2 max each).
round_targets: >
  C-27 full pass: Phase 5 defeat assessment table column header and Phase 5 exit
  criterion field name are lexically identical (both read "Consequence if unchanged"
  or a single consistent alternative); match is verifiable without reading surrounding
  prose.
  C-28 full pass: Preamble before Phase 5 table states the blocking rule
  (rows with empty "Consequence if unchanged" field cannot be evaluated or advance)
  as a self-contained statement; AND exit criterion independently names
  "Consequence if unchanged" as a named advancement condition; neither site
  references the other to carry the constraint.
  V-01 pattern (C-27 pass, C-28 partial): column and exit criterion match, no
  preamble site. V-02 pattern (C-27 partial, C-28 full): both blocking sites
  present and self-contained, but column header uses old name that differs from
  the term used at the blocking sites. V-03--V-05 patterns: both C-27 and C-28
  full pass.

  C-27 fail, C-28 fail: R11 V-01 pattern -- column renamed but exit criterion

  C-27 pass, C-28 partial: column and exit criterion use identical term; only one
  blocking site present (exit criterion only, no preamble). V-01 R12.
  C-27 partial, C-28 full: both blocking sites present with identical term at
  those sites; column header uses a different name. V-02 R12.
  C-27 pass, C-28 full: identical field name at column header and exit criterion;
  preamble and exit criterion both present and self-contained. V-03--V-05 R12.

## V-01 -- Axis: Lexical Identity (C-27)

**Variation axis**: The Phase 5 defeat assessment column is renamed from
"Consequence if HOLDS" to "Consequence if unchanged". The Phase 5 exit criterion
is updated to name "Consequence if unchanged" as the blocking field. The column
header and exit criterion field name are now lexically identical -- a reviewer
reading only the exit criterion can identify which column the rule applies to
without consulting surrounding prose. C-28 (preamble before table) is deliberately
absent: only the exit criterion blocking site is present. This isolates C-27 from
C-28.

**Hypothesis**: C-27 full pass requires both the column header and exit criterion
to be updated as a matched pair to the same string. Renaming the column alone fails
(exit criterion still references a different term). Updating only the exit criterion
fails (column header still uses the old name). The specific gap in R11 V-01 was
that the column was renamed but the exit criterion was not updated -- both changes
must be made together. C-28 is deliberately absent so that the scorer can confirm
C-27 passes independently of C-28. Base is R10 V-04 (C-21 + C-22 + C-23 + C-24 +
C-25 full stack). Only changes from R10 V-04: (1) Output Schema Phase 5 column
renamed; (2) Phase 5 table column renamed; (3) exit criterion names the field.

## INERTIA COMPETITOR DECLARATION

[>> GUARD: INERTIA PRIOR <<]
[>> Bias blocked: action-default bias -- change is not the default; INERTIA is <<]
[>> Mechanism: Every phase tests whether challenger evidence defeats the incumbent
     position. INERTIA wins without evidence. Change requires a verdict. <<]

INERTIA is the named competitor. INERTIA wins by default.
Zero proposals is a valid, complete, excellent execution.
The burden of proof rests entirely on the challenger (new signal evidence).

---

## Output Schema -- Committed Before Any File Is Read

[>> GUARD: SCHEMA COMMITMENT <<]
[>> Bias blocked: post-hoc rationalization -- columns fixed before evidence is seen <<]
[>> Mechanism: A schema committed before reading cannot be retrospectively adjusted
     to fit the evidence shape. Column violations are detectable against this block. <<]

Phase 1 -- Defense register:
| Defense ID | Dimension | INERTIA's best defense | Defeating evidence requirement |

Phase 2 -- Signal inventory:
| Artifact filename | Artifact date | NEW / PRIOR | Namespace |

Phase 4 -- Delta findings (per category):
| Finding ID | Category | Dimension | Understanding changed: prior -> now | Source artifact |

Phase 5 -- Defeat assessment:
| Defense ID | Dimension | INERTIA's defense | Challenger evidence | Verdict (DEFEATED / HOLDS) | Consequence if unchanged |

Phase 6a -- Additions:
| # | Dimension | Evidence | Before | After | Confidence | Consequence if unchanged | Inertia defeated because |

Phase 6b -- Removals and Reprioritizations:

## Phase 1 -- Pre-Signal Defense Register

[>> SECTION SCOPE: This section contains the Phase 1 read-barrier and restart
     isolation clause ONLY. It does not contain verdict vocabulary definitions.
     It does not contain INERTIA-GATE exclusion text. A reviewer auditing the
     read-barrier does not encounter content from the Verdict Vocabulary section
     or either INERTIA-GATE site. <<]

[>> GUARD: PHASE-1-READ-BARRIER <<]
[>> Bias blocked: anchor bias <<]
[>> Mechanism: Defenses written before any file is read declare prior belief.
     Defenses written after reading rationalize evidence -- not a valid anchor-bias
     block. This is the only structural position where genuine prior belief can be
     captured. <<]

FIRST-RUN ISOLATION: No files have been read yet.
DO NOT read strategy.md or any signal file before Phase 1 is complete.
If any file has been read, restart Phase 1 without it in context.

RESTART ISOLATION: If execution resumes after an interruption without prior context,
do NOT re-read strategy.md or any signal file to reconstruct the state of this run.
Write the defense register from prior knowledge only. Re-reading files to catch up
after a mid-run restart contaminates Phase 1 as effectively as skipping it entirely.
The defense register must reflect beliefs before evidence -- not beliefs reconstructed
from evidence previously seen in a prior interrupted session.

ENTRY CONDITION: No files have been read since Phase 1 began (first run or restart).

| Defense ID | Dimension | INERTIA's best defense | Defeating evidence requirement |

EXIT CRITERION: Defense register table present; each known dimension has a row; no
file has been read (first run or restart). Phase 2 may NOT open until this is met.

## Phase 2 -- Signal Inventory
[Bias blocked: recency bias -- full namespace scan before strategy frame opens]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 1 EXIT CRITERION met.
Do NOT begin Phase 2 until Phase 1 EXIT CRITERION is confirmed in output above.

Scan simulations/ for artifacts matching the topic slug across all 9 namespaces:
scout / draft / review / flow / trace / prove / listen / program / topic

Read TOPICS.md to locate strategy.md. Record STRATEGY DATE as a named field
before classification begins.
Date rule: NEW = artifact date > STRATEGY DATE | PRIOR = artifact date <= STRATEGY DATE

| Artifact filename | Artifact date | NEW / PRIOR | Namespace |

All 9 namespaces must appear. Zero-artifact namespaces emit an explicit null row.

[>> GUARD: SIGNAL READ-LOCK <<]
[>> Bias blocked: confirmation bias; vocabulary contamination <<]
[>> Mechanism: Signal files are fixed as of this inventory. Re-reading a signal file
     after this point introduces post-hoc vocabulary alignment with the strategy frame.
     This lock closes that path. Signal files may NOT be re-read after this inventory
     is written. All subsequent phases use the written inventory only. <<]

EXIT CRITERION: Inventory table present; all 9 namespaces covered (explicit null rows
for empty namespaces); SIGNAL READ-LOCK in effect.
Phase 3 may NOT open until this is met.

---

## Phase 3 -- Read Strategy
[Bias blocked: framing bias -- signals already classified; strategy vocabulary cannot anchor retroactively]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 2 EXIT CRITERION met.
Do NOT read strategy.md until Phase 2 EXIT CRITERION is confirmed in output above.

Read strategy.md. Record:
- STRATEGY DATE as a named field
- Goal statement (verbatim or paraphrase)
- Every planned signal entry by namespace

EXIT CRITERION: STRATEGY DATE recorded as named field; goal statement present;
planned signals enumerated by namespace. Phase 4 may NOT open until this is met.

## Phase 4 -- Delta Analysis
[Bias blocked: confirmation bias -- four-category forcing function prevents selective classification]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 3 EXIT CRITERION met.
Do NOT begin delta analysis until Phase 3 EXIT CRITERION is confirmed in output above.

For each NEW artifact, classify each finding. Do not merge categories.

### CONFIRMED -- INERTIA's assumptions validated by NEW signals
| Finding ID | Category | Dimension | Understanding changed: prior -> now | Source artifact |
Null: "CONFIRMED: none -- no NEW artifacts validate INERTIA's assumptions."

### EXPANDED -- INERTIA's assumptions broadened by NEW signals
| Finding ID | Category | Dimension | Understanding changed: prior -> now | Source artifact |
Null: "EXPANDED: none -- no NEW artifacts expand INERTIA's assumptions."

### UNEXPECTED -- dimensions INERTIA's strategy did not cover
| Finding ID | Category | Dimension | Understanding changed: prior -> now | Source artifact |
Null: "UNEXPECTED: none -- no NEW artifacts reveal uncovered dimensions."

### CHALLENGED -- INERTIA's assumptions directly questioned
| Finding ID | Category | Dimension | Understanding changed: prior -> now | Source artifact |
Null: "CHALLENGED: none -- no NEW artifacts challenge INERTIA's assumptions."

EXIT CRITERION: All four category tables present with labeled nulls; each NEW artifact
in at least one category. Phase 5 may NOT open until this is met.

## Verdict Vocabulary

[>> SECTION SCOPE: This section contains verdict definitions ONLY. It does not contain
     Phase 1 read-barrier language. It does not contain restart isolation clause text.
     It does not contain INERTIA-GATE exclusion text. A reviewer auditing verdict
     semantics does not encounter content from Phase 1 or either INERTIA-GATE site. <<]

[>> GUARD: VERDICT SEMANTICS BLOCK <<]
[>> Bias blocked: definitional ambiguity -- both verdict outcomes fully specified as
     standalone definitions, independently verifiable without reading Phase 5 <<]
[>> Mechanism: A scorer or auditor can confirm verdict semantics from this block alone.
     Phase 5 applies these definitions; it does not redefine them. <<]

DEFEATED: Challenger evidence overcomes INERTIA's Phase 1 defense for this dimension.
  Forward path: dimension advances to Phase 6 (Change Proposals).

HOLDS: INERTIA's defense survives for this dimension. Dimension receives NO CHANGE.
  Forward path: no path to Phase 6. Execution for this dimension ends at Phase 5.

These two verdicts are exhaustive. No other verdict tokens are valid.

Confidence tier for DEFEATED rows (defined here; applied in Phase 5):
- HIGH: two or more independent NEW artifacts support the defeat on this dimension
- MEDIUM: one NEW artifact
- LOW: inference only (no direct NEW artifact evidence)

## Phase 5 -- INERTIA DEFEAT ASSESSMENT

[>> SECTION SCOPE: This section contains gate-exclusion text and consequence blocking
     enforcement ONLY. It does not redefine verdict semantics (those are defined in
     the Verdict Vocabulary block above). It does not contain restart isolation
     language. A reviewer auditing the Phase 5 gate does not encounter verdict
     redefinitions or restart clause text. <<]

[>> GUARD: INERTIA-GATE [Site 1 of 2 -- Phase 5 entry] <<]
[>> Bias blocked: action-default bias; status-quo neglect <<]
[>> Mechanism: Only DEFEATED dimensions advance to Phase 6. HOLDS dimensions have
     no path to Phase 6. This enforcement is at the Phase 5 entry site. A second
     independent enforcement exists at Phase 6 entry (Site 2 of 2). <<]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 4 EXIT CRITERION met (all four delta categories present).
Do NOT open Phase 5 until Phase 4 EXIT CRITERION is confirmed in output above.

Apply the Verdict Vocabulary defined above.
Do not redefine verdict semantics here.
Any inline DEFEATED or HOLDS definition appearing in this phase is a structural
violation of the single-source guarantee established by the Verdict Vocabulary block.

| Defense ID | Dimension | INERTIA's defense | Challenger evidence | Verdict (DEFEATED / HOLDS) | Consequence if unchanged |

If all verdicts are HOLDS: emit "NULL_DELTA: INERTIA RETAINED ACROSS ALL DIMENSIONS."
Stop. Phase 6 does NOT open.

EXIT CRITERION: Verdict table complete; all dimensions adjudicated; NULL_DELTA emitted
if all HOLDS; exit blocked if any DEFEATED row has an empty "Consequence if unchanged"
field; at least one DEFEATED verdict with populated "Consequence if unchanged" field
to proceed to Phase 6.

## Phase 6 -- Change Proposals (DEFEATED dimensions only)

[>> SECTION SCOPE: This section contains gate-exclusion text and proposal generation
     only. It does not redefine verdict semantics. A reviewer auditing the Phase 6
     gate does not encounter verdict redefinitions. <<]

[>> GUARD: INERTIA-GATE [Site 2 of 2 -- Phase 6 entry] <<]
[>> Bias blocked: action-default bias <<]
[>> Mechanism: HOLDS dimensions have no row and no path to this phase. This enforcement
     is independent of Site 1 at Phase 5. A model that bypasses Phase 5 and arrives
     directly at Phase 6 still encounters this gate. HOLDS exclusion is enforced here
     without relying on the Phase 5 site to carry the constraint. A reviewer can
     confirm HOLDS exclusion from this block alone, without reading Phase 5. <<]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 5 EXIT CRITERION met; at least one DEFEATED verdict present;
NULL_DELTA not emitted. Do NOT open Phase 6 if NULL_DELTA was emitted in Phase 5.

### 6a -- Additions
| # | Dimension | Evidence | Before | After | Confidence | Consequence if unchanged | Inertia defeated because |
Null: "ADDITIONS: none -- INERTIA holds on all addition candidates."

### 6b -- Removals and Reprioritizations
| # | Action (REMOVE / REPRIORITIZE) | Dimension | Evidence | Before | After | Confidence | Consequence if unchanged | Inertia defeated because |
Null-REMOVALS: "REMOVALS: none -- INERTIA holds."
Null-REPRIORITIZATIONS: "REPRIORITIZATIONS: none -- INERTIA holds."

All 9 namespaces must have a row. Silence is not a null declaration.

EXIT CRITERION: All three change-type tables present with labeled nulls; all 9
namespaces covered; each DEFEATED dimension from Phase 5 has a corresponding row.
Phase 7 may NOT open until this is met.

## Phase 7 -- Confirmation Gate

[>> GUARD: CONFIRMATION GATE <<]
[>> Bias blocked: recency bias; sunk-cost bias <<]
[>> Mechanism: Explicit user confirmation required before any write. The absence
     of NO is not implicit YES. <<]

[>> GUARD: WRITE GUARD <<]
[>> Bias blocked: premature closure bias <<]
[>> Mechanism: strategy.md is not modified until explicit YES or REVISED is received
     at this gate. strategy.md has NOT been modified at this point. <<]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 6 EXIT CRITERION met.
Do NOT modify strategy.md before Phase 7 confirmation is received.

Present: Phase 4 delta findings (all four categories), Phase 6 proposals (6a and 6b).

---
PENDING CONFIRMATION -- strategy.md has NOT been modified.
INERTIA currently holds. Proposed challenges: [N] additions / [N] removals / [N] reprioritizations

Reply YES to displace INERTIA on all listed dimensions
Reply NO to retain INERTIA (all dimensions unchanged)
Reply REVISED + edited table to displace INERTIA on custom dimensions
Reply WITHDRAW [#] to remove specific proposals before confirming
  WITHDRAW syntax: WITHDRAW [2] or WITHDRAW [1, 3]. Removes named proposals only;
  remainder is applied.
  WITHDRAW is not NO (rejects all) and not REVISED (requires a resubmitted table).
---
STOP HERE. Write nothing further until the user replies.

EXIT CRITERION: User has replied YES, NO, REVISED, or WITHDRAW.

---

## Phase 8 -- Apply (after YES or REVISED only)

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 7 EXIT CRITERION met (explicit YES or REVISED received).
Do NOT write to strategy.md before this ENTRY CONDITION is confirmed.

[>> GUARD: WRITE GUARD (confirmed) <<]
[>> Bias blocked: premature closure bias -- write authorized by user at Phase 7 <<]

Write confirmed (non-withdrawn) changes to strategy.md.
No reformatting of unchanged sections.
Confirm: "strategy.md updated: [N] additions, [N] removals, [N] reprioritizations.
INERTIA displaced on: [dimension list]."

## V-02 -- Axis: Dual-Site Blocking (C-28)

**Variation axis**: A preamble block labeled CONSEQUENCE GATE [Site 1 of 2] is placed
immediately before the Phase 5 defeat assessment table, asserting that any row with
an empty "Consequence if unchanged" field cannot be evaluated and cannot advance. The
exit criterion (Site 2 of 2) independently restates the blocking rule using the same
term. Neither site references the other. The Phase 5 table column header deliberately
retains the old name "Consequence if HOLDS" from R10 -- this creates a C-27 partial
condition (column header uses a different term than the blocking sites) while isolating
C-28 as the single new mechanism.

**Hypothesis**: C-28 requires two orthogonal structural sites for the blocking rule:
preamble guards row entry, exit criterion guards phase departure. Each site must be
self-contained. A variation that has both sites present and neither delegating to the
other achieves C-28 full pass. C-27 is deliberately partial: the column header says
"Consequence if HOLDS" while both blocking sites say "Consequence if unchanged" --
intent matches but lexical identity between column and exit criterion fails. This
is the C-27 partial / C-28 full orthogonality scenario described in the rubric.
Base is R10 V-04 (C-21 + C-22 + C-23 + C-24 + C-25 full stack). Only changes:
(1) preamble block added before Phase 5 table; (2) exit criterion updated with
"Consequence if unchanged" blocking rule; (3) column header intentionally not renamed.

## V-03 -- Combined: Lexical Identity + Dual-Site Blocking (C-27 + C-28, minimal base)

**Variation axes**: C-27 (column header "Consequence if unchanged" + matching exit
criterion field name) + C-28 (preamble before table as site 1; exit criterion as
site 2; each self-contained). Applied to a minimal base that omits C-21 (dual-site
INERTIA-GATE), C-22 (restart isolation), C-23 (standalone verdict vocabulary block),
C-24 (spatial separation), and C-25 (anti-duplication clause).

**Hypothesis**: C-27 and C-28 are independently achievable from a minimal base that
carries only essential criteria. C-21 through C-25 are not prerequisites for C-27
or C-28 -- the consequence field lexical identity and dual-site blocking are orthogonal
to the verdict vocabulary and spatial separation machinery. If this minimal variation
achieves C-27 full + C-28 full, it confirms the two new criteria can be extracted and
promoted without dragging the full stack. The SECTION SCOPE declarations and dual-site
INERTIA-GATE are absent. C-21 fails (single-site gate). C-22 fails (no restart clause).
C-23 fails (no standalone verdict block). C-24 fails (no spatial separation). C-25
fails (no anti-duplication clause). C-27 and C-28 both pass.

## Phase 1 -- Pre-Signal Defense Register
[Bias blocked: anchor bias]

ENTRY CONDITION: No files have been read yet.
DO NOT read strategy.md or any signal file before Phase 1 is complete.

For each active strategy dimension you are aware of from prior context, write one row:

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 4 EXIT CRITERION met.
Do NOT open Phase 5 until Phase 4 EXIT CRITERION is confirmed in output above.

CONSEQUENCE GATE [Site 1 of 2 -- table entry]: Any row in this table with an empty
"Consequence if unchanged" field cannot be evaluated and cannot advance. Populate
"Consequence if unchanged" before assigning a verdict to that row. This rule is
stated at this preamble site independently. It does not delegate to the exit
criterion to carry the constraint.

| Defense ID | Dimension | INERTIA's defense | Challenger evidence | Verdict (DEFEATED / HOLDS) | Consequence if unchanged |

If all verdicts are HOLDS: emit "NULL_DELTA: INERTIA RETAINED ACROSS ALL DIMENSIONS."
Stop. Phase 6 does NOT open.

EXIT CRITERION: Verdict table complete; all dimensions adjudicated; NULL_DELTA emitted
if all HOLDS; exit blocked if any DEFEATED row has an empty "Consequence if unchanged"
field -- this blocking rule is stated at this exit criterion site independently. It
does not delegate to the preamble above to carry the constraint. At least one DEFEATED
verdict with populated "Consequence if unchanged" field to proceed to Phase 6.

## V-04 -- Combined: Full Stack + C-27 + C-28 (C-21 through C-28)

**Variation axes**: R10 V-04 (C-21 + C-22 + C-23 + C-24 + C-25) as base. Add C-27
(column header and exit criterion field name lexically identical: both "Consequence
if unchanged"). Add C-28 (preamble before table as Site 1; exit criterion as Site 2;
each self-contained without delegating to the other). This is the seven-criterion
integration built on the R10 V-04 foundation.

**Hypothesis**: R10 V-04 combined five structural mechanisms without tension. V-04 R12
adds C-27 and C-28 on top of that proven stack. C-27 is achieved by updating both the
Output Schema commitment block and the Phase 5 table column to "Consequence if unchanged"
and ensuring the exit criterion names that exact string. C-28 is achieved by inserting
the CONSEQUENCE GATE preamble block immediately before the table (Site 1) and updating
the exit criterion to independently restate the blocking rule (Site 2). The SECTION SCOPE
for Phase 5 is updated to acknowledge consequence blocking enforcement as part of its
declared scope. All seven criteria should achieve full pass. The primary question is
whether adding C-28's preamble block inside the Phase 5 section creates any C-24
spatial contamination -- it should not, because the preamble is categorized as
"consequence blocking enforcement" within the Phase 5 SECTION SCOPE, which already
covers "gate-exclusion text."

[>> SECTION SCOPE: This section contains the Phase 1 read-barrier and restart
     isolation clause ONLY. It does not contain verdict vocabulary definitions.
     It does not contain INERTIA-GATE exclusion text. A reviewer auditing the

     Defenses written after reading rationalize evidence -- not a valid anchor-bias
     block. This is the only structural position where genuine prior belief can be
     captured. <<]

FIRST-RUN ISOLATION: No files have been read yet.
DO NOT read strategy.md or any signal file before Phase 1 is complete.
If any file has been read, restart Phase 1 without it in context.

RESTART ISOLATION: If execution resumes after an interruption without prior context,
do NOT re-read strategy.md or any signal file to reconstruct the state of this run.
Write the defense register from prior knowledge only. Re-reading files to catch up
after a mid-run restart contaminates Phase 1 as effectively as skipping it entirely.
The defense register must reflect beliefs before evidence -- not beliefs reconstructed
from evidence previously seen in a prior interrupted session.

ENTRY CONDITION: No files have been read since Phase 1 began (first run or restart).

| Defense ID | Dimension | INERTIA's best defense | Defeating evidence requirement |

EXIT CRITERION: Defense register table present; each known dimension has a row; no
file has been read (first run or restart). Phase 2 may NOT open until this is met.

## Verdict Vocabulary

[>> SECTION SCOPE: This section contains verdict definitions ONLY. It does not contain
     Phase 1 read-barrier language. It does not contain restart isolation clause text.
     It does not contain INERTIA-GATE exclusion text. It does not contain consequence
     blocking enforcement. A reviewer auditing verdict semantics does not encounter
     content from Phase 1, either INERTIA-GATE site, or the consequence gate. <<]

[>> GUARD: VERDICT SEMANTICS BLOCK <<]
[>> Bias blocked: definitional ambiguity -- both verdict outcomes fully specified as
     standalone definitions, independently verifiable without reading Phase 5 <<]
[>> Mechanism: A scorer or auditor can confirm verdict semantics from this block alone.
     Phase 5 applies these definitions; it does not redefine them. <<]

DEFEATED: Challenger evidence overcomes INERTIA's Phase 1 defense for this dimension.
  Forward path: dimension advances to Phase 6 (Change Proposals).

HOLDS: INERTIA's defense survives for this dimension. Dimension receives NO CHANGE.
  Forward path: no path to Phase 6. Execution for this dimension ends at Phase 5.

These two verdicts are exhaustive. No other verdict tokens are valid.

Confidence tier for DEFEATED rows (defined here; applied in Phase 5):
- HIGH: two or more independent NEW artifacts support the defeat on this dimension
- MEDIUM: one NEW artifact
- LOW: inference only (no direct NEW artifact evidence)

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 4 EXIT CRITERION met (all four delta categories present).
Do NOT open Phase 5 until Phase 4 EXIT CRITERION is confirmed in output above.

Apply the Verdict Vocabulary defined above.
Do not redefine verdict semantics here.
Any inline DEFEATED or HOLDS definition appearing in this phase is a structural
violation of the single-source guarantee established by the Verdict Vocabulary block.

[>> GUARD: CONSEQUENCE GATE [Site 1 of 2 -- table entry] <<]
[>> Bias blocked: consequence-omission bias -- consequence stated before verdict assigned <<]
[>> Mechanism: Requiring the consequence field before the verdict prevents post-hoc

     It does not delegate to the Phase 5 exit criterion to carry the constraint. <<]
Any row in this table with an empty "Consequence if unchanged" field cannot be
evaluated and cannot advance. Populate "Consequence if unchanged" before assigning
a verdict to that row.

| Defense ID | Dimension | INERTIA's defense | Challenger evidence | Verdict (DEFEATED / HOLDS) | Consequence if unchanged |

If all verdicts are HOLDS: emit "NULL_DELTA: INERTIA RETAINED ACROSS ALL DIMENSIONS."
Stop. Phase 6 does NOT open.

EXIT CRITERION: Verdict table complete; all dimensions adjudicated; NULL_DELTA emitted

field -- this blocking rule is stated at this exit criterion site independently. It
does not delegate to the preamble above to carry the constraint. At least one DEFEATED
verdict with populated "Consequence if unchanged" field to proceed to Phase 6.

     without relying on the Phase 5 site to carry the constraint. A reviewer can
     confirm HOLDS exclusion from this block alone, without reading Phase 5. <<]

## V-05 -- Combined: Full Stack + C-27 + C-28 + Schema Pre-Commitment (C-21 through C-28, triple-site)

**Variation axes**: V-04 (C-21 through C-28) as base. Add one additional mechanism:
the Output Schema commitment block names the Phase 5 column as "Consequence if unchanged"
and adds an explicit CONTRACT ANNOTATION stating that the column name at the Phase 5
table site MUST match this pre-committed name exactly. This creates a triple-site
verification chain: (1) Output Schema declares "Consequence if unchanged" before any
file is read; (2) Phase 5 table column header uses "Consequence if unchanged"; (3)
Phase 5 exit criterion names "Consequence if unchanged". Any drift between the three
sites is detectable against the pre-committed schema.

**Hypothesis**: V-04 achieves C-27 full pass through sites 2 and 3 (table column =
exit criterion). V-05 extends this by pre-committing site 1 (Output Schema) before
evidence is read, making the column name a contractual declaration rather than a
post-read choice. The contract annotation in the Schema block makes violations at
the Phase 5 site detectable as schema violations -- a scorer can cite the pre-committed
schema to identify a C-27 failure without needing to compare Phase 5 column and exit
criterion directly. This variation also tests whether the Schema block annotation
introduces any C-24 spatial contamination (it should not -- the annotation belongs
to the Schema block's scope, not to the verdict vocabulary or gate sections). All
eight criteria (C-21 through C-28) should achieve full pass.

     content from the Verdict Vocabulary section, either INERTIA-GATE site, or the
     Output Schema block. <<]

[>> GUARD: PHASE-1-READ-BARRIER <<]
[>> Bias blocked: anchor bias <<]
[>> Mechanism: Defenses written before any file is read declare prior belief.
     Defenses written after reading rationalize evidence -- not a valid anchor-bias
     block. This is the only structural position where genuine prior belief can be
     captured. <<]

FIRST-RUN ISOLATION: No files have been read yet.
DO NOT read strategy.md or any signal file before Phase 1 is complete.
If any file has been read, restart Phase 1 without it in context.

RESTART ISOLATION: If execution resumes after an interruption without prior context,
do NOT re-read strategy.md or any signal file to reconstruct the state of this run.
Write the defense register from prior knowledge only. Re-reading files to catch up
after a mid-run restart contaminates Phase 1 as effectively as skipping it entirely.
The defense register must reflect beliefs before evidence -- not beliefs reconstructed
from evidence previously seen in a prior interrupted session.

ENTRY CONDITION: No files have been read since Phase 1 began (first run or restart).

| Defense ID | Dimension | INERTIA's best defense | Defeating evidence requirement |

EXIT CRITERION: Defense register table present; each known dimension has a row; no
file has been read (first run or restart). Phase 2 may NOT open until this is met.

## Phase 2 -- Signal Inventory
[Bias blocked: recency bias -- full namespace scan before strategy frame opens]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 1 EXIT CRITERION met.
Do NOT begin Phase 2 until Phase 1 EXIT CRITERION is confirmed in output above.

Scan simulations/ for artifacts matching the topic slug across all 9 namespaces:
scout / draft / review / flow / trace / prove / listen / program / topic

Read TOPICS.md to locate strategy.md. Record STRATEGY DATE as a named field
before classification begins.
Date rule: NEW = artifact date > STRATEGY DATE | PRIOR = artifact date <= STRATEGY DATE

| Artifact filename | Artifact date | NEW / PRIOR | Namespace |

All 9 namespaces must appear. Zero-artifact namespaces emit an explicit null row.

[>> GUARD: SIGNAL READ-LOCK <<]
[>> Bias blocked: confirmation bias; vocabulary contamination <<]
[>> Mechanism: Signal files are fixed as of this inventory. Re-reading a signal file
     after this point introduces post-hoc vocabulary alignment with the strategy frame.
     This lock closes that path. Signal files may NOT be re-read after this inventory
     is written. All subsequent phases use the written inventory only. <<]

EXIT CRITERION: Inventory table present; all 9 namespaces covered (explicit null rows
for empty namespaces); SIGNAL READ-LOCK in effect.
Phase 3 may NOT open until this is met.

---

## Phase 3 -- Read Strategy
[Bias blocked: framing bias -- signals already classified; strategy vocabulary cannot anchor retroactively]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 2 EXIT CRITERION met.
Do NOT read strategy.md until Phase 2 EXIT CRITERION is confirmed in output above.

Read strategy.md. Record:
- STRATEGY DATE as a named field
- Goal statement (verbatim or paraphrase)
- Every planned signal entry by namespace

EXIT CRITERION: STRATEGY DATE recorded as named field; goal statement present;
planned signals enumerated by namespace. Phase 4 may NOT open until this is met.

---

## Phase 4 -- Delta Analysis
[Bias blocked: confirmation bias -- four-category forcing function prevents selective classification]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 3 EXIT CRITERION met.
Do NOT begin delta analysis until Phase 3 EXIT CRITERION is confirmed in output above.

For each NEW artifact, classify each finding. Do not merge categories.

### CONFIRMED -- INERTIA's assumptions validated by NEW signals
| Finding ID | Category | Dimension | Understanding changed: prior -> now | Source artifact |
Null: "CONFIRMED: none -- no NEW artifacts validate INERTIA's assumptions."

### EXPANDED -- INERTIA's assumptions broadened by NEW signals
| Finding ID | Category | Dimension | Understanding changed: prior -> now | Source artifact |
Null: "EXPANDED: none -- no NEW artifacts expand INERTIA's assumptions."

### UNEXPECTED -- dimensions INERTIA's strategy did not cover
| Finding ID | Category | Dimension | Understanding changed: prior -> now | Source artifact |
Null: "UNEXPECTED: none -- no NEW artifacts reveal uncovered dimensions."

### CHALLENGED -- INERTIA's assumptions directly questioned
| Finding ID | Category | Dimension | Understanding changed: prior -> now | Source artifact |
Null: "CHALLENGED: none -- no NEW artifacts challenge INERTIA's assumptions."

EXIT CRITERION: All four category tables present with labeled nulls; each NEW artifact
in at least one category. Phase 5 may NOT open until this is met.

## Verdict Vocabulary

[>> SECTION SCOPE: This section contains verdict definitions ONLY. It does not contain
     Phase 1 read-barrier language. It does not contain restart isolation clause text.
     It does not contain INERTIA-GATE exclusion text. It does not contain consequence
     blocking enforcement. It does not contain schema contract annotations. A reviewer
     auditing verdict semantics does not encounter content from any other mechanism
     section. <<]

[>> GUARD: VERDICT SEMANTICS BLOCK <<]
[>> Bias blocked: definitional ambiguity -- both verdict outcomes fully specified as
     standalone definitions, independently verifiable without reading Phase 5 <<]
[>> Mechanism: A scorer or auditor can confirm verdict semantics from this block alone.
     Phase 5 applies these definitions; it does not redefine them. <<]

DEFEATED: Challenger evidence overcomes INERTIA's Phase 1 defense for this dimension.
  Forward path: dimension advances to Phase 6 (Change Proposals).

HOLDS: INERTIA's defense survives for this dimension. Dimension receives NO CHANGE.
  Forward path: no path to Phase 6. Execution for this dimension ends at Phase 5.

These two verdicts are exhaustive. No other verdict tokens are valid.

Confidence tier for DEFEATED rows (defined here; applied in Phase 5):
- HIGH: two or more independent NEW artifacts support the defeat on this dimension
- MEDIUM: one NEW artifact
- LOW: inference only (no direct NEW artifact evidence)

---

## Phase 5 -- INERTIA DEFEAT ASSESSMENT

[>> SECTION SCOPE: This section contains gate-exclusion text and consequence blocking
     enforcement ONLY. It does not redefine verdict semantics (defined in Verdict
     Vocabulary above). It does not contain restart isolation language. It does not
     contain schema contract annotations (those are in the Output Schema block). A
     reviewer auditing the Phase 5 gate does not encounter verdict redefinitions,
     restart clause text, or schema contract language. <<]

[>> GUARD: INERTIA-GATE [Site 1 of 2 -- Phase 5 entry] <<]
[>> Bias blocked: action-default bias; status-quo neglect <<]
[>> Mechanism: Only DEFEATED dimensions advance to Phase 6. HOLDS dimensions have
     no path to Phase 6. This enforcement is at the Phase 5 entry site. A second
     independent enforcement exists at Phase 6 entry (Site 2 of 2). <<]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 4 EXIT CRITERION met (all four delta categories present).
Do NOT open Phase 5 until Phase 4 EXIT CRITERION is confirmed in output above.

Apply the Verdict Vocabulary defined above.
Do not redefine verdict semantics here.
Any inline DEFEATED or HOLDS definition appearing in this phase is a structural
violation of the single-source guarantee established by the Verdict Vocabulary block.

[>> GUARD: CONSEQUENCE GATE [Site 1 of 2 -- table entry] <<]
[>> Bias blocked: consequence-omission bias -- consequence stated before verdict assigned <<]
[>> Mechanism: Requiring the consequence field before the verdict prevents post-hoc
     consequence invention. This rule is stated at this preamble site independently.
     It does not delegate to the Phase 5 exit criterion to carry the constraint. <<]
Any row in this table with an empty "Consequence if unchanged" field cannot be
evaluated and cannot advance. Populate "Consequence if unchanged" before assigning
a verdict to that row.

| Defense ID | Dimension | INERTIA's defense | Challenger evidence | Verdict (DEFEATED / HOLDS) | Consequence if unchanged |

If all verdicts are HOLDS: emit "NULL_DELTA: INERTIA RETAINED ACROSS ALL DIMENSIONS."
Stop. Phase 6 does NOT open.

EXIT CRITERION: Verdict table complete; all dimensions adjudicated; NULL_DELTA emitted
if all HOLDS; exit blocked if any DEFEATED row has an empty "Consequence if unchanged"
field -- this blocking rule is stated at this exit criterion site independently. It
does not delegate to the preamble above to carry the constraint. At least one DEFEATED
verdict with populated "Consequence if unchanged" field to proceed to Phase 6.

---

## Phase 6 -- Change Proposals (DEFEATED dimensions only)

[>> SECTION SCOPE: This section contains gate-exclusion text and proposal generation
     only. It does not redefine verdict semantics. A reviewer auditing the Phase 6
     gate does not encounter verdict redefinitions. <<]

[>> GUARD: INERTIA-GATE [Site 2 of 2 -- Phase 6 entry] <<]
[>> Bias blocked: action-default bias <<]
[>> Mechanism: HOLDS dimensions have no row and no path to this phase. This enforcement
     is independent of Site 1 at Phase 5. A model that bypasses Phase 5 and arrives
     directly at Phase 6 still encounters this gate. HOLDS exclusion is enforced here
     without relying on the Phase 5 site to carry the constraint. A reviewer can
     confirm HOLDS exclusion from this block alone, without reading Phase 5. <<]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 5 EXIT CRITERION met; at least one DEFEATED verdict present;
NULL_DELTA not emitted. Do NOT open Phase 6 if NULL_DELTA was emitted in Phase 5.

### 6a -- Additions
| # | Dimension | Evidence | Before | After | Confidence | Consequence if unchanged | Inertia defeated because |
Null: "ADDITIONS: none -- INERTIA holds on all addition candidates."

### 6b -- Removals and Reprioritizations
| # | Action (REMOVE / REPRIORITIZE) | Dimension | Evidence | Before | After | Confidence | Consequence if unchanged | Inertia defeated because |
Null-REMOVALS: "REMOVALS: none -- INERTIA holds."
Null-REPRIORITIZATIONS: "REPRIORITIZATIONS: none -- INERTIA holds."

All 9 namespaces must have a row. Silence is not a null declaration.

EXIT CRITERION: All three change-type tables present with labeled nulls; all 9
namespaces covered; each DEFEATED dimension from Phase 5 has a corresponding row.
Phase 7 may NOT open until this is met.

---

## Phase 7 -- Confirmation Gate

[>> GUARD: CONFIRMATION GATE <<]
[>> Bias blocked: recency bias; sunk-cost bias <<]
[>> Mechanism: Explicit user confirmation required before any write. The absence
     of NO is not implicit YES. <<]

[>> GUARD: WRITE GUARD <<]
[>> Bias blocked: premature closure bias <<]
[>> Mechanism: strategy.md is not modified until explicit YES or REVISED is received
     at this gate. strategy.md has NOT been modified at this point. <<]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 6 EXIT CRITERION met.
Do NOT modify strategy.md before Phase 7 confirmation is received.

Present: Phase 4 delta findings (all four categories), Phase 6 proposals (6a and 6b).

---
PENDING CONFIRMATION -- strategy.md has NOT been modified.
INERTIA currently holds. Proposed challenges: [N] additions / [N] removals / [N] reprioritizations

Reply YES to displace INERTIA on all listed dimensions
Reply NO to retain INERTIA (all dimensions unchanged)
Reply REVISED + edited table to displace INERTIA on custom dimensions
Reply WITHDRAW [#] to remove specific proposals before confirming
  WITHDRAW syntax: WITHDRAW [2] or WITHDRAW [1, 3]. Removes named proposals only;
  remainder is applied.
  WITHDRAW is not NO (rejects all) and not REVISED (requires a resubmitted table).
---
STOP HERE. Write nothing further until the user replies.

EXIT CRITERION: User has replied YES, NO, REVISED, or WITHDRAW.

---

## Phase 8 -- Apply (after YES or REVISED only)

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 7 EXIT CRITERION met (explicit YES or REVISED received).
Do NOT write to strategy.md before this ENTRY CONDITION is confirmed.

[>> GUARD: WRITE GUARD (confirmed) <<]
[>> Bias blocked: premature closure bias -- write authorized by user at Phase 7 <<]

Write confirmed (non-withdrawn) changes to strategy.md.
No reformatting of unchanged sections.
Confirm: "strategy.md updated: [N] additions, [N] removals, [N] reprioritizations.
INERTIA displaced on: [dimension list]."
```
