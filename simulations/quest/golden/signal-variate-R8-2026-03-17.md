descriptions.

## Context: what informed this round

R7 V-05 achieved 100.00 under v8: all 19/19 aspirational criteria pass. The v8 rubric
introduced C-25 (FULL MODE restart gate), C-26 (counted acknowledgment), and C-27
(per-section count self-check). All three were already present in R7 V-05, confirming
V-05 as the new universal baseline.

Under v8 the retroactive leaderboard is:

| V | C-25 | C-26 | C-27 | Aspirational | Composite |
|---|------|------|------|--------------|-----------|
| **V-05** | PASS | PASS | PASS | 19/19 -> 10 | **100.00** |
| V-04 | PASS | PASS | FAIL | 18/19 -> 9.47 | **99.47** |
| V-01 | PASS | FAIL | FAIL | 17/19 -> 8.95 | **98.95** |
| V-02 | FAIL | PASS | FAIL | 17/19 -> 8.95 | **98.95** |
| V-03 | FAIL | FAIL | PASS | 17/19 -> 8.95 | **98.95** |

R8 goal: **excellence-signal discovery beyond the current ceiling.** R7 V-05 satisfies
every criterion in v8. The question is: what failure modes remain that V-05 does not
address? Three candidate axes identified from structural analysis of R7 V-05:

- **Axis J**: FULL MODE's compliance gate verifies namespace-presence (C-25 Check 1)
  and per-namespace count (C-25 Check 2), but does not verify namespace emit-order.
  A model could emit all 12 namespaces in correct counts but in wrong sequence
  (e.g., org first, then scout). The transcription gate pledges character-for-character
  fidelity but does not explicitly name emit order as a constraint; the compliance gate
  would still pass (12 present, all counts correct). BARE MODE has C-21 (explicit
  begin+end anchors); FULL MODE has no equivalent order declaration. Adding a third
  check to COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE (or an explicit ORDER DECLARATION for FULL MODE)
  stating "emit namespaces in this sequence: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove,
  listen, program, topic, quest, mock, org" closes the gap and creates order symmetry
  between BARE and FULL modes.

- **Axis K**: FILTER MODE's compliance gate has Check 1 (scope) and Check 2 (count)
  (C-20). BARE MODE's compliance gate has Check 1 (format) and Check 2 (count) (C-18).
  Structural gap: FILTER MODE has no format check. A model could emit filter output with
  correct scope and count but malformed sections (e.g., bare command names without
  headers, or missing footers). The SECTION FORMAT instruction says "FULL and FILTER
  modes" but the compliance gate does not verify format compliance at pre-emit time. A
  Check 3 in COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE -- "does the output follow SECTION FORMAT
  template?" with restart trigger -- closes the format verification gap for filter mode.
  This is symmetric with BARE MODE's format check (Check 1) applied to FILTER mode.

- **Axis L**: BARE MODE instruction says "No `/` prefix" and the catalog entries all
  carry a leading `/` (e.g., `/scout-competitors`). A model naively copying from the
  catalog would include the slash. The instruction prohibits it, but prohibitions work
  better with an explicit before/after transformation rule: "`/scout-competitors`
  becomes `scout-competitors`." This is structurally parallel to C-16's per-row
  example-pad column: instead of requiring the model to apply a rule it must infer
  from a prohibition, an explicit transformation example makes the output pattern
  directly copyable. First+last examples (first entry `/scout-competitors`, last
  entry `/org-committee`) would anchor both ends of the bare output, complementing
  the C-21 order anchors at the catalog-sequence level.

All five R8 variations carry the full R7 V-05 mechanism set:
- Catalog-first ordering (C-17)
- Active transcription gate with 61-entry count + IS-the-output labeling (C-22+C-23+C-26)
- Bare-mode count gate with per-namespace breakdown (C-18)
- Canonical-namespace guard enumerating all 12 names (C-19)
- Both compliance gates with restart triggers for bare and filter (C-14)
- Filter-mode count gate (C-20)
- Bare order anchors: Begin with scout-competitors, End with org-committee (C-21)
- Symmetric mode completeness -- all three paths verified (C-24)
- FULL MODE compliance gate: namespace-presence + per-namespace count (C-25)
- Transcription gate counted acknowledgment (C-26)
- Per-section count self-check in SECTION FORMAT (C-27)
- Precomputed width table with per-row example pad (C-15+C-16)
- Domain noun table (C-11)
- Format consistency (C-13)
- Accurate skill counts (C-06)
- Dispatch footers (C-07)
- Column alignment (C-12)

## SPREAD-DESIGN PLAN

| Variation | Axis | Source Signal | Target Criteria | Predicted |
|-----------|------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| V-01 | Axis J single: FULL MODE emit-order declaration | Structural gap: BARE has C-21 order anchors; FULL has no order check. Add Check 3 to COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE: canonical sequence verification with restart. | C-28 (predicted) | 100.00 |
| V-02 | Axis K single: FILTER MODE format compliance check | Structural gap: FILTER gate has scope+count but no format check. Add Check 3: SECTION FORMAT compliance verification with restart. | C-29 (predicted) | 100.00 |
| V-03 | Axis L single: BARE MODE slash-strip transformation rule | Explicit before/after transformation example (/scout-competitors -> scout-competitors). Prohibition alone ("No / prefix") relies on model inference; example makes pattern directly copyable. | C-30 (predicted) | 100.00 |
| V-04 | Axes J+K combined | FULL MODE order check + FILTER MODE format check. Both structural compliance additions without slash-strip. | C-28+C-29 (predicted) | 100.00 |
| V-05 | Axes J+K+L: triple convergence | All three axes applied to R7 V-05 base. Predicted to satisfy any C-28/C-29/C-30 criteria the rubric may extract from R8 signals. | C-28+C-29+C-30 (predicted) | 100.00 |

All five variations are predicted to score 100.00 under v8 since all carry the full
R7 V-05 mechanism set. The axes probe for excellence signals beyond the current
ceiling -- the rubric will decide whether they encode new criteria.

## V-01 -- Single-axis: FULL MODE Emit-Order Declaration (Axis J)

**Axis**: COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE upgraded with Check 3 (order): canonical
namespace emit-sequence verified before output, with restart if violated.
**Hypothesis**: R7 V-05's FULL MODE compliance gate has Check 1 (namespace presence:
all 12 canonical namespaces present) and Check 2 (per-namespace count: each section has
exactly its canonical sub-skill count). Neither checks the sequence in which namespaces
are emitted. BARE MODE has C-21: "Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee."
This anchors bare output order at both ends. FULL MODE has no equivalent: the
transcription gate pledges character-for-character fidelity from the catalog, and the
catalog defines a sequence, but the compliance gate does not explicitly verify that
sections appear in catalog order before emitting. A model satisfying C-25 (Check 1 +
Check 2) could still reorder sections -- e.g., topic before scout -- and the gate would
not trigger a restart. Adding Check 3 to COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE: "Are namespace
sections in canonical order: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program,
topic, quest, mock, org?" with a restart trigger closes this gap and creates order
verification symmetry between BARE and FULL modes.
No change to NAMESPACE CATALOG header, BARE MODE, or FILTER MODE gate.

PARSE MODE:

  /signal --bare       -> BARE (command names only, one per line, no prose)
  /signal <namespace>  -> FILTER if <namespace> is a canonical namespace; FULL otherwise
  anything else        -> FULL

Canonical namespaces (exactly these 12): scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove,
listen, program, topic, quest, mock, org.
If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

Per-section count self-check: before emitting the dispatch footer for each namespace
section, verify: the number of sub-skill lines above the footer equals the canonical
count for that namespace (scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9,
listen=3, program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4) AND equals the N stated in the
section header. If either count differs, restart the section from its header.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE (precomputed -- do not recount)

  namespace  longest command name        width  example pad
  ---------  -------------------------  -----  -----------
  scout      /scout-stakeholders           19   /scout-naming (13) needs 7 spaces

  org        /org-committee                14   /org-roles (10) needs 5 spaces

DOMAIN NOUN TABLE

Replace <DOMAIN-NOUN> in each footer with the exact noun listed here.
Do not use a generic placeholder. Do not omit the noun.

  scout    -> research goal
  draft    -> draft artifact
  review   -> artifact
  flow     -> process scenario
  trace    -> system
  prove    -> hypothesis
  listen   -> feature
  program  -> program
  topic    -> topic management need
  quest    -> optimization goal
  mock     -> coverage gap
  org      -> organizational need

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE

Before emitting FULL output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (completeness): Does your output include sections for all 12 canonical
    namespaces: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic,
    quest, mock, org?
    If any namespace is absent -- MODE: FULL is incomplete. Restart.
  Check 2 (count): Does each namespace section contain exactly the canonical number
    of sub-skills?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If any section's count differs -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are namespace sections emitted in canonical order?
    Canonical order: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program,
    topic, quest, mock, org. (First section: scout. Last section: org.)
    If any section appears out of canonical sequence -- order violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run both checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, run both checks:
  Check 1 (scope): Does your output include any command from a namespace other than
    the one requested?
    If yes -- MODE: FILTER scope is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly the canonical count of skills
    for the requested namespace?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated in the filter output. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee.
```

## V-02 -- Single-axis: FILTER MODE Format Compliance Check (Axis K)

**Axis**: COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE upgraded with Check 3 (format): SECTION
FORMAT compliance verified before filter output is emitted, with restart if violated.
**Hypothesis**: R7 V-05's FILTER MODE compliance gate has Check 1 (scope: only the
requested namespace appears) and Check 2 (count: canonical number of sub-skills for
that namespace). Neither verifies that the filter output follows SECTION FORMAT. A model
could emit correct scope and correct count but using wrong format -- e.g., bare command
names without headers or footers, or headers in wrong syntax, or missing dispatch
footers. BARE MODE's compliance gate has a format check (Check 1: no line contains
anything other than a bare command name). FILTER MODE lacks an equivalent. Adding Check
3 to COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE: "Does the filter output follow SECTION FORMAT?
Required: a header line (- /<namespace> -- <purpose> -- <N> skills), sub-skill lines
with -> separator, and a dispatch footer. If any element is missing -- FILTER output
format violated. Restart." closes the format verification gap for filter mode and creates
format-check symmetry between BARE (Check 1: format) and FILTER (Check 3: format).
No change to NAMESPACE CATALOG header, COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE, or BARE MODE.

PARSE MODE:
  /signal              -> FULL (all 12 namespaces)
  /signal --bare       -> BARE (command names only, one per line, no prose)
  /signal <namespace>  -> FILTER if <namespace> is a canonical namespace; FULL otherwise
  anything else        -> FULL

Canonical namespaces (exactly these 12): scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove,
listen, program, topic, quest, mock, org.
If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

Per-section count self-check: before emitting the dispatch footer for each namespace
section, verify: the number of sub-skill lines above the footer equals the canonical
count for that namespace (scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9,
listen=3, program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4) AND equals the N stated in the
section header. If either count differs, restart the section from its header.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE (precomputed -- do not recount)

DOMAIN NOUN TABLE

Replace <DOMAIN-NOUN> in each footer with the exact noun listed here.
Do not use a generic placeholder. Do not omit the noun.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE

Before emitting FULL output, run both checks:
  Check 1 (completeness): Does your output include sections for all 12 canonical
    namespaces: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic,
    quest, mock, org?
    If any namespace is absent -- MODE: FULL is incomplete. Restart.
  Check 2 (count): Does each namespace section contain exactly the canonical number
    of sub-skills?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If any section's count differs -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run both checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (scope): Does your output include any command from a namespace other than
    the one requested?
    If yes -- MODE: FILTER scope is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly the canonical count of skills
    for the requested namespace?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated in the filter output. Restart.
  Check 3 (format): Does the filter output follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Required elements: (1) a header line in the form "- /<namespace> -- <purpose> --
    <N> skills", (2) sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator, (3) a dispatch
    footer in the form "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>...".
    If any required element is absent or malformed -- FILTER output format violated. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee.

## V-03 -- Single-axis: BARE MODE Slash-Strip Transformation Rule (Axis L)

**Axis**: BARE MODE upgraded with an explicit slash-strip transformation rule including
a before/after worked example for both the first and last catalog entries.
**Hypothesis**: R7 V-05's BARE MODE says "No `/` prefix." Every catalog entry carries a
leading `/` (e.g., `/scout-competitors`). The prohibition instructs the model not to
include the slash but does not show the transformation. A model that reads the catalog
and naively copies entries would include the slash; it must apply an inferred rule to
strip it. This is structurally the same gap that led to C-16 (per-row example-pad
derivation): C-15 stated the alignment algorithm; C-16 added a worked example per row
so the model copies a pattern rather than computes. "No `/` prefix" states the rule;
an explicit transformation example makes the pattern directly copyable:
  `/scout-competitors` -> `scout-competitors`
  `/org-committee`     -> `org-committee`
Adding first-entry and last-entry examples anchors both ends of the transformation space,
consistent with C-21's first+last order anchors for bare output sequence. The two worked
examples (first entry in catalog, last entry in catalog) confirm the model should strip
exactly the leading `/` character, no more.
No change to NAMESPACE CATALOG, COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE, or FILTER MODE gate.

## V-04 -- Combined: Axes J+K (FULL MODE Order Check + FILTER MODE Format Check)

**Axis**: COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE upgraded with Check 3 (order) AND COMPLIANCE
GATE -- FILTER MODE upgraded with Check 3 (format). Both structural compliance
additions without the slash-strip transformation rule.
**Hypothesis**: Axis J (FULL order check) and Axis K (FILTER format check) address
structural gaps in two different compliance gates at the same level of abstraction --
each adds a third check to an existing two-check gate, closing a verification dimension
that was previously unspecified. Neither modifies the same gate: J upgrades FULL,
K upgrades FILTER. No interaction effects predicted. The per-row example pad derivation
(C-16) established that lookup-based disambiguation is independently additive; same
logic applies here. V-05 adds L (slash-strip) to confirm that axis operates
independently of J and K.
No change to NAMESPACE CATALOG header or BARE MODE beyond the R7 V-05 base.

  /signal              -> FULL (all 12 namespaces)
  /signal --bare       -> BARE (command names only, one per line, no prose)
  /signal <namespace>  -> FILTER if <namespace> is a canonical namespace; FULL otherwise
  anything else        -> FULL

Canonical namespaces (exactly these 12): scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove,
listen, program, topic, quest, mock, org.
If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

Per-section count self-check: before emitting the dispatch footer for each namespace
section, verify: the number of sub-skill lines above the footer equals the canonical
count for that namespace (scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9,
listen=3, program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4) AND equals the N stated in the
section header. If either count differs, restart the section from its header.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE (precomputed -- do not recount)

DOMAIN NOUN TABLE

Replace <DOMAIN-NOUN> in each footer with the exact noun listed here.
Do not use a generic placeholder. Do not omit the noun.

  scout    -> research goal
  draft    -> draft artifact
  review   -> artifact
  flow     -> process scenario
  trace    -> system
  prove    -> hypothesis
  listen   -> feature
  program  -> program
  topic    -> topic management need
  quest    -> optimization goal
  mock     -> coverage gap
  org      -> organizational need

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE

Before emitting FULL output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (completeness): Does your output include sections for all 12 canonical
    namespaces: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic,
    quest, mock, org?
    If any namespace is absent -- MODE: FULL is incomplete. Restart.
  Check 2 (count): Does each namespace section contain exactly the canonical number
    of sub-skills?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If any section's count differs -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are namespace sections emitted in canonical order?
    Canonical order: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program,
    topic, quest, mock, org. (First section: scout. Last section: org.)
    If any section appears out of canonical sequence -- order violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run both checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (scope): Does your output include any command from a namespace other than
    the one requested?
    If yes -- MODE: FILTER scope is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly the canonical count of skills
    for the requested namespace?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated in the filter output. Restart.
  Check 3 (format): Does the filter output follow SECTION FORMAT?
    Required elements: (1) a header line in the form "- /<namespace> -- <purpose> --
    <N> skills", (2) sub-skill lines each using the "-> " separator, (3) a dispatch
    footer in the form "Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <domain-noun>...".
    If any required element is absent or malformed -- FILTER output format violated. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee.
```

## V-05 -- Triple Convergence: Axes J+K+L (Golden Target)

**Axis**: All three R8 axes combined in the R7 V-05 base -- the first variation to
probe all three post-ceiling mechanisms simultaneously.
**Hypothesis**: Axis J (FULL MODE order check), Axis K (FILTER MODE format check), and
Axis L (BARE MODE slash-strip transformation example) address three structurally
independent aspects of output correctness:
- J: FULL mode, compliance gate level, sequence verification
- K: FILTER mode, compliance gate level, format verification
- L: BARE mode, output construction level, transformation rule disambiguation

None modifies the same section or mechanism as another. Each is independently
isolation-tested in V-01/V-02/V-03. J+K combination confirmed in V-04. Adding L
to the J+K base should produce triple convergence.

The three changes from R7 V-05 to R8 V-05:
1. COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE: add Check 3 (order): canonical sequence verified,
   restart if violated (Axis J)
2. COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE: add Check 3 (format): SECTION FORMAT compliance
   verified, restart if violated (Axis K)
3. BARE MODE: add slash-strip transformation rule with first+last worked examples
   (`/scout-competitors` -> `scout-competitors`; `/org-committee` -> `org-committee`)
   (Axis L)

```
The user wants the Signal command index. Show them what is available so they can find the right skill.

NAMESPACE CATALOG -- TRANSCRIPTION GATE
Before transcribing: confirm you have read all 61 entries across the 12 namespace
sections below (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61). You will emit each entry
character-for-character. The catalog below IS the output for FULL and FILTER modes.
Do not paraphrase, condense, reorder, or reconstruct from memory. Any deviation from
the catalog text is an output failure, not an acceptable approximation.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FULL MODE

Before emitting FULL output, run all three checks:
  Check 1 (completeness): Does your output include sections for all 12 canonical
    namespaces: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic,
    quest, mock, org?
    If any namespace is absent -- MODE: FULL is incomplete. Restart.

    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If any section's count differs -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.
  Check 3 (order): Are namespace sections emitted in canonical order?
    Canonical order: scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program,

    If any section appears out of canonical sequence -- order violated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run both checks:

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee.

Slash-strip transformation: catalog entries carry a leading `/`. Strip it.
  `/scout-competitors` becomes `scout-competitors`  (first entry)
  `/org-committee`     becomes `org-committee`      (last entry)
Remove only the leading `/`. No other characters change.
