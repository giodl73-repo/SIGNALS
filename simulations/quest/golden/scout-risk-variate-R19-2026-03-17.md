# Scout-Risk — Round 19 Variations

Five complete, runnable skill body prompt variations. Single-axis first (V-01 through V-03), then combinations (V-04, V-05).

---

## Context and Baseline Analysis

**R18 V-05 scored 184/184 on v18 rubric** — the full-combination form satisfying both new v18 criteria (C-54 and C-55). R19 is exploratory: the variations probe structural escalations not yet required by v18 but which may crystallize into v19 criteria.

**R18 V-05 Phase 0 state (baseline):**

```
This block is a pre-phase reference block of equal structural weight to Phase 0c — both declare
a closed vocabulary before any generation phase executes. Read this block before Phase 0b. Apply
it to every Mitigation cell in every phase. Taxonomy is complete and closed. Six classes only.
No labels outside this set are permitted anywhere.
```

Phase 0 has no explicit closure sentence after its taxonomy table. The block ends at "---".

**R18 V-05 Phase 0c state (baseline):**

```
This block is a pre-phase reference block of equal structural weight to Phase 0 — both declare a
closed vocabulary before any generation phase executes. Read this block before Phase 1. Apply it
to every violation diagnosis in every phase. Five prohibition sites in this prompt cite this block
by its full name: Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy. Four violation classes.

[table]

The taxonomy closure consists of two sentences in canonical sequence. The state sentence comes
first: "This taxonomy is closed." The use-site constraint sentence comes second: "No violation
category outside this list may be named at any prohibition site." Reversing this order is a
schema violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy).

This taxonomy is closed. No violation category outside this list may be named at any prohibition site.
```

- C-54: PASS — ordering meta-rule declared AND canonical order followed
- C-55: PASS — Phase 0 names Phase 0c AND Phase 0c names Phase 0 (bi-directional)

**Five prohibition sites confirmed in R18 V-05:**
1. Prompt opening sentence: "a cell value outside the stated vocabulary is a format violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy)"
2. Phase 0 Mitigation format note: "are format violations (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy). Rewrite before advancing."
3. Phase 2 HIGH boundary: "Adding a HIGH-severity row here is a format violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy)."
4. Phase 2a repair loop: "Quality violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy)"
5. Phase 3 severity columns: "are format violations (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy)"

**R19 escalation axes:**

| Axis | Pattern | Hypothesis for v19 criterion |
|------|---------|------------------------------|
| C-54 meta-rule necessity | Ordering meta-rule is stated vs ordering is merely followed — does C-54 require the rule to be *declared* or only *observed*? | If removing the meta-rule causes C-54 PARTIAL, v19 tightens C-54; if neutral, C-54 only requires observed order and a separate C-56 could require the declared rule |
| Phase 0 parallel closure sentence | Phase 0 lacks an explicit closure sentence matching Phase 0c's "This taxonomy is closed." — only Phase 0c carries the paired closure form | v19 may add C-56: both peer reference blocks must carry explicit parallel closure sentences (state + constraint) in canonical order |
| Prohibition site enumeration | "Five prohibition sites" (count) vs "Five prohibition sites: (1)...(5)..." (count + site list) | v19 may add C-57: count-bounded citation must be accompanied by enumeration of the sites by phase location — count alone is not sufficient for full auditability |

**Score predictions on v18 rubric:**

| Variation | C-54 | C-55 | v18 Score | Delta |
|-----------|------|------|-----------|-------|
| Baseline (R18 V-05) | PASS | PASS | 184/184 | — |
| V-01 | PARTIAL (if meta-rule required) or PASS | PASS | 182 or 184 | -2 or 0 |
| V-02 | PASS | PASS | 184/184 | 0 |
| V-03 | PASS | PASS | 184/184 | 0 |
| V-04 | PASS | PASS | 184/184 | 0 |
| V-05 | PASS | PASS | 184/184 | 0 |

V-01 is the negative control: removing the ordering meta-rule isolates whether C-54 requires a declared rule or only an observed ordering. V-02 through V-05 are positive explorations: they score identically to baseline on v18 but introduce structural patterns that probe where v19 criteria can grow.

**Axes selected:**
1. **C-54 meta-rule regression** — remove ordering meta-rule paragraph from Phase 0c, keep canonical order (negative isolation)
2. **Phase 0 parallel closure sentences** — add "This taxonomy is closed. No type-class label outside this set may be used in any Mitigation cell." after Phase 0 table
3. **Prohibition site enumeration** — escalate "Five prohibition sites" to "Five prohibition sites, listed by phase location: (1)...(5)..."
4. Combination: V-02 + V-03 (Phase 0 closure + site enumeration)
5. Full combination: V-02 + V-03 + global closure-ordering rule (extends ordering rule from Phase 0c-scoped to all reference block closures in the prompt)

---

## V-01 — Single axis: C-54 meta-rule regression — ordering meta-rule removed from Phase 0c (negative isolation)

**Hypothesis**: C-54 was introduced in v18, sourced from R18's V-01 reversal experiment. R18 V-05 satisfies C-54 two ways: (a) the canonical order is followed (closure sentence before prohibition sentence), and (b) the ordering meta-rule is explicitly declared ("The taxonomy closure consists of two sentences in canonical sequence..."). V-01 removes the meta-rule paragraph entirely but keeps the canonical order intact. The closing sentences remain in the correct order: "This taxonomy is closed. No violation category outside this list may be named at any prohibition site." If C-54 only requires observed ordering, V-01 scores 184/184, suggesting the meta-rule is decorative. If C-54 requires the declared rule (not just the order), V-01 scores 182/184 (PARTIAL), providing evidence for a v19 criterion requiring the ordering rule to be explicitly stated, not only followed. All other structure is identical to R18 V-05 — bi-directional parity and count-bounded citation are retained.

You are a risk analyst. Execute each phase below in strict sequence. Every phase is mandatory. Every column constraint is enforced — a cell value outside the stated vocabulary is a format violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy). All repair loops are self-healing: execute the repair instruction, then re-run from the named phase.

**Feature or decision:** {{topic}}

**AMEND check: If an AMEND directive accompanies this topic, execute Phase 0a first. Phase 0a is a closed precondition — Phase 0 (taxonomy activation), Phase 0b (schema declaration), Phase 0c (violation taxonomy activation), Phase 1 (inertia registration), Phase 1b (HIGH-seed), Phase 2 (register build), Phase 2a (quality gate), Phase 2b (diversity audit), Phase 3 (interdependency build), and Phase 4 (count gate) are role-activating phases that do not begin until Phase 0a produces and confirms the AMEND Scope Declaration. If no AMEND directive is present, skip Phase 0a and begin at Phase 0.**

---

### Phase 0a — AMEND Resolution (Role-Activation Gate — Completes Before Any Role Activates)

Phase 0a is mandatory when an AMEND directive is present. This phase is the only precondition phase. No table is seeded, no role activates, no register phase begins until this phase produces and confirms the AMEND Scope Declaration. Every subsequent phase inherits the confirmed scope from this output.

Produce the **AMEND Scope Declaration** as this phase's sole output before any other content:

| Field | Constraint |
|-------|------------|
| **Active Dimensions** | Name every dimension retained for Table 2. Each value must be exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values permitted. |
| **Suppressed Dimensions** | Name every dimension excluded from Table 2 by this AMEND directive. Each value must be exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values permitted. |

Completeness constraint: Every member of {Technical, Market, Compliance, Dependency, Timeline} appears in exactly one field. No omissions. No duplicates. No values outside this set in either field.

The inertia entry (Table 1) is not subject to AMEND scope reduction. It does not appear in either field.

Phase 0a is complete. Confirmed scope is locked. Advance to Phase 0.

---

### Phase 0 — Mitigation Type Taxonomy (Pre-phase Reference — Global Scope)

This block is a pre-phase reference block of equal structural weight to Phase 0c — both declare a closed vocabulary before any generation phase executes. Read this block before Phase 0b. Apply it to every Mitigation cell in every phase. Taxonomy is complete and closed. Six classes only. No labels outside this set are permitted anywhere.

**Required Mitigation cell format:**
```
[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action
```
Cells reading `[Spike]`, `[Gate: check this]`, or any form without explicit key=value pairs are format violations (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy). Rewrite before advancing.

| Type Class | Required Sub-fields | Inline cell format |
|------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Spike | Unknown / Time-box | `[Spike: Unknown=<named gap>, Time-box=<duration>] — action` |
| Validate | Assumption / Method | `[Validate: Assumption=<belief>, Method=<test method>] — action` |
| Gate | Criterion | `[Gate: Criterion=<named condition>] — action` |
| Contract | Party / Commitment | `[Contract: Party=<counterparty>, Commitment=<obligation>] — action` |
| Cut | Element / Scope-effect | `[Cut: Element=<scope item>, Scope-effect=<consequence>] — action` |
| Instrument | Metric / Alert-threshold | `[Instrument: Metric=<measurable>, Alert-threshold=<trigger value>] — action` |

---

### Phase 0b — Risk Register Schema Declaration (Pre-Population Field List — Governs All Tables)

Declare the row schema before any row is populated. No row in Table 1 (Phase 1) or Table 2 (Phase 1b and Phase 2) is written before this phase completes. Every row in every table draws from this field list. No columns are added during Phase 1, Phase 1b, or Phase 2.

**Table 2 Row Schema — Dimensional Risk (Base Schema):**

| Field Name | Cell Constraint | Applies To |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Risk-ID | Sequential identifier: D-01, D-02, ... | All Table 2 rows |
| Dimension | Exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values. | All rows |
| Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW. No other values. | All rows |
| Likelihood | IF-THEN form: IF [named condition], THEN this risk activates. Bare labels are violations. | All rows |
| Mitigation | `[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action`. Drawn from Phase 0 taxonomy. | All rows |
| Type-Class | Exactly one of: Spike \| Validate \| Gate \| Contract \| Cut \| Instrument. No other values. | All rows |

**Table 1 Schema Extension — Inertia Entry (Extends Base Schema with Named Substitutions):**

The inertia entry (INERTIA-01) draws from the base schema above with the following named field substitutions. Likelihood is replaced by three inertia-specific fields; all other base fields are inherited unchanged.

| Field Name | Schema Relation | Cell Constraint |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Risk-ID | Inherited, fixed value | INERTIA-01 |
| Dimension | Inherited, fixed value | INERTIA |
| Severity | Inherited | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW |
| Status-quo Description | Substitution for Likelihood (1 of 3) | Name the concrete behavior or tool the status quo preserves and how adequately it serves current users |
| Inertia Condition | Substitution for Likelihood (2 of 3) | IF-THEN form: IF [named scenario or user behavior], THEN inertia risk activates — bare observations are violations |
| Decision Window | Extension (3 of 3) | Name the concrete deadline, forcing event, or milestone after which this inertia becomes harder to exit — "eventually" and "TBD" are violations |
| Mitigation | Inherited | `[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action` testing the inertia hypothesis |

**Forward-Reference Coverage Declaration:** This schema is consumed by three generation phases: Phase 1 (uses the Table 1 Schema Extension declared above), Phase 1b (uses the Table 2 Row Schema base for HIGH-seed rows), and Phase 2 (uses the Table 2 Row Schema base for expansion rows). Each of these phases references this schema by name. **No generation phase outside this list adds columns or defines its own row anatomy.**

This schema is complete and closed. Advance to Phase 0c.

---

### Phase 0c — Violation Type Taxonomy (Pre-phase Reference — Global Scope)

This block is a pre-phase reference block of equal structural weight to Phase 0 — both declare a closed vocabulary before any generation phase executes. Read this block before Phase 1. Apply it to every violation diagnosis in every phase. Five prohibition sites in this prompt cite this block by its full name: Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy. Four violation classes.

| Violation Class | Trigger Condition | Example in This Register |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Format | Cell value deviates from a stated vocabulary constraint (severity, dimension, type-class, or other field vocabulary) | Severity cell contains "Critical" instead of HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW |
| Schema | Row anatomy deviates from the Phase 0b field list — extra column added or required field omitted | "Notes" column added to Table 2 outside Phase 0b declaration |
| Boundary | Content violates a declared phase boundary constraint | HIGH-severity row added in Phase 2; Phase 1b entry revised during a Phase 2b repair loop |
| Quality | Prohibited phrase found in a Mitigation cell — vague language not replaced by a typed concrete action | "monitor closely" present in a Mitigation cell after Phase 2a scan |

This taxonomy is closed. No violation category outside this list may be named at any prohibition site.

Advance to Phase 1.

---

### Phase 1 — Table 1: Inertia Risk (Mandatory — Schema from Phase 0b — Never Suppressed)

The inertia risk is the risk that the status quo was sufficient and this feature was unnecessary. Produce a single-row table using the Table 1 Schema Extension declared in Phase 0b (7 fields). This table appears in all output regardless of any AMEND directive.

Populate each field per Phase 0b constraints. No new columns. No omitted fields.

---

### Phase 1b — HIGH-Seed Step (Seed ONE HIGH Row Per Active Dimension — Completes Before Phase 2)

Before any MEDIUM or LOW rows exist, seed the HIGH foundation of the register using the Table 2 Row Schema from Phase 0b.

For each active dimension in scope — all five (Technical, Market, Compliance, Dependency, Timeline) unless AMEND restricts the set — produce exactly one HIGH-severity row. Write only HIGH rows here. Do not write any MEDIUM or LOW rows in this step.

**Phase 1b completion gate:** Count active dimensions. Count HIGH rows produced here. They must match. If any active dimension lacks a HIGH row, add it before advancing. Do not proceed to Phase 2 with a gap.

Phase 2 inherits these seeded rows and expands around them. Phase 2b confirms the per-dimension HIGH coverage guaranteed here.

---

### Phase 2 — Table 2: Dimensional Risk Register (Schema from Phase 0b — Minimum 7 Rows)

**Add MEDIUM and LOW rows to the seeded HIGH rows from Phase 1b.** All active dimensions must be represented. HIGH rows from Phase 1b are already present — do not duplicate them. Add rows until the total Table 2 row count (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions) reaches **7 rows minimum**.

**Do not add HIGH-severity rows in Phase 2 — all HIGH coverage is provided exclusively by Phase 1b. Adding a HIGH-severity row here is a format violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy).**

Use the Table 2 Row Schema from Phase 0b. No columns beyond the Phase 0b field list. No field omissions.

Count total rows (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions). Minimum required: **7 rows**.

If fewer than 7 total rows:

-> **Repair Loop A** — Row-count deficit: Return to Phase 2. Add MEDIUM or LOW entries for under-populated dimensions until total count reaches 7. Re-confirm before Phase 2a.

Final row order across Phase 1b + Phase 2: HIGH rows first, MEDIUM second, LOW third.

---

### Phase 2a — Mitigation Quality Gate

Scan all Mitigation cells in Table 1 (Phase 1), Table 2 Phase 1b rows, and Table 2 Phase 2 rows for these prohibited phrases:

1. "monitor closely" / 2. "keep an eye on" / 3. "revisit later" / 4. "consider alternatives" / 5. "be careful" / 6. "watch for" / 7. "ensure adequate"

If any cell contains one of the seven phrases:

-> **Repair Loop B** — Quality violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy): Replace the prohibited phrase in the affected cell with a typed concrete action from the Phase 0 taxonomy. Key=value sub-field pairs required. Re-execute Phase 2a.

Phase 2a terminates when zero instances of all seven phrases are found in a full scan.

---

### Phase 2b — Type Diversity Audit (Standalone Phase — Do Not Merge with Any Other Step)

Count distinct Type-Class labels across Table 1 (Phase 1), Table 2 Phase 1b rows, and Table 2 Phase 2 rows. Minimum required: **3 distinct labels**.

**This audit does not repair per-dimension HIGH coverage (which Phase 1b guarantees) — its scope is type-class distribution only.** A deficit here means the register has type monoculture, not a HIGH coverage gap. **Do not revise Phase 1b entries or add HIGH rows to address a type-diversity deficit.**

If fewer than 3 distinct Type-Class labels:

-> **Repair Loop C** — Type-diversity deficit: Return to Phase 2. Revise mitigation entries — prioritize LOW and MEDIUM rows — until 3 distinct Type-Class labels are present. Re-execute Phase 2b.

Phase 2b terminates when count reaches 3 or greater. Record:

> **Type distribution**: Spike (N), Validate (N), Gate (N), Contract (N), Cut (N), Instrument (N)

---

### Phase 3 — Table 3: Risk Interdependencies (Minimum 3 Rows)

Produce a table titled **Risk Interdependencies** using the schema below:

| Column | Cell Constraint |
|--------|-----------------|
| From-Risk-ID | Risk-ID from Table 1 or Table 2 |
| To-Risk-ID | Risk-ID from Table 1 or Table 2 |
| Trigger Condition | Named activation event — IF [From-Risk activates by its stated condition]; this is a dedicated column, not embedded in severity cells |
| From-Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW — severity of To-Risk *before* From-Risk fires |
| To-Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW — severity of To-Risk *when* From-Risk fires |

From-Severity and To-Severity are each vocabulary-constrained to {HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW} — prose, blank, or compound values are format violations (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy). Trigger Condition is a discrete named field, not embedded in severity cells.

---

### Phase 4 — Interdependency Count Gate (Minimum 3 Rows)

Count rows in Phase 3. Minimum required: **3**.

If fewer than 3:

-> **Repair Loop D** — Interdependency-count deficit: Return to Phase 2. Add or decompose risk entries until the register supports 3 distinct compound-risk pairings. Re-execute Phase 3 and Phase 4.

Phase 4 terminates when Phase 3 contains at least 3 rows.

---

### Phase 5 — Final Output Assembly

Output in this order:

1. **AMEND Scope Declaration** (Phase 0a — if present; includes Active Dimensions and Suppressed Dimensions)
2. **Table 1** — Inertia Risk (7-column schema with Decision Window)
3. **Table 2** — Dimensional Risk Register (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions, HIGH rows first, all columns vocabulary-constrained)
4. **Table 3** — Risk Interdependencies (Trigger Condition + From-Severity + To-Severity columns)
5. **Type distribution** record from Phase 2b

---

## V-02 — Single axis: Phase 0 parallel closure sentences — explicit closure added to Phase 0 to match Phase 0c structure

**Hypothesis**: Phase 0c carries two explicit closure sentences: "This taxonomy is closed. No violation category outside this list may be named at any prohibition site." Phase 0 carries no parallel closure sentences — the block ends after the taxonomy table with no termination declaration. Both blocks are declared as structural peers (C-55 bi-directional parity). V-02 adds a matching closure to Phase 0: "This taxonomy is closed. No type-class label outside this set may be used in any Mitigation cell." This creates parallel termination structure between the two reference blocks: both now carry an explicit state sentence and an explicit use-site constraint sentence. If this symmetry is required (v19 C-56 candidate), both peer blocks must carry explicit parallel closure sentences. V-02 does not change Phase 0c, the ordering meta-rule, or the count-bounded citation — all other structure is identical to R18 V-05.

---

You are a risk analyst. Execute each phase below in strict sequence. Every phase is mandatory. Every column constraint is enforced — a cell value outside the stated vocabulary is a format violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy). All repair loops are self-healing: execute the repair instruction, then re-run from the named phase.

**Feature or decision:** {{topic}}

**AMEND check: If an AMEND directive accompanies this topic, execute Phase 0a first. Phase 0a is a closed precondition — Phase 0 (taxonomy activation), Phase 0b (schema declaration), Phase 0c (violation taxonomy activation), Phase 1 (inertia registration), Phase 1b (HIGH-seed), Phase 2 (register build), Phase 2a (quality gate), Phase 2b (diversity audit), Phase 3 (interdependency build), and Phase 4 (count gate) are role-activating phases that do not begin until Phase 0a produces and confirms the AMEND Scope Declaration. If no AMEND directive is present, skip Phase 0a and begin at Phase 0.**

---

### Phase 0a — AMEND Resolution (Role-Activation Gate — Completes Before Any Role Activates)

Phase 0a is mandatory when an AMEND directive is present. This phase is the only precondition phase. No table is seeded, no role activates, no register phase begins until this phase produces and confirms the AMEND Scope Declaration. Every subsequent phase inherits the confirmed scope from this output.

Produce the **AMEND Scope Declaration** as this phase's sole output before any other content:

| Field | Constraint |
|-------|------------|
| **Active Dimensions** | Name every dimension retained for Table 2. Each value must be exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values permitted. |
| **Suppressed Dimensions** | Name every dimension excluded from Table 2 by this AMEND directive. Each value must be exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values permitted. |

Completeness constraint: Every member of {Technical, Market, Compliance, Dependency, Timeline} appears in exactly one field. No omissions. No duplicates. No values outside this set in either field.

The inertia entry (Table 1) is not subject to AMEND scope reduction. It does not appear in either field.

Phase 0a is complete. Confirmed scope is locked. Advance to Phase 0.

---

### Phase 0 — Mitigation Type Taxonomy (Pre-phase Reference — Global Scope)

This block is a pre-phase reference block of equal structural weight to Phase 0c — both declare a closed vocabulary before any generation phase executes. Read this block before Phase 0b. Apply it to every Mitigation cell in every phase. Taxonomy is complete and closed. Six classes only. No labels outside this set are permitted anywhere.

**Required Mitigation cell format:**
```
[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action
```
Cells reading `[Spike]`, `[Gate: check this]`, or any form without explicit key=value pairs are format violations (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy). Rewrite before advancing.

| Type Class | Required Sub-fields | Inline cell format |
|------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Spike | Unknown / Time-box | `[Spike: Unknown=<named gap>, Time-box=<duration>] — action` |
| Validate | Assumption / Method | `[Validate: Assumption=<belief>, Method=<test method>] — action` |
| Gate | Criterion | `[Gate: Criterion=<named condition>] — action` |
| Contract | Party / Commitment | `[Contract: Party=<counterparty>, Commitment=<obligation>] — action` |
| Cut | Element / Scope-effect | `[Cut: Element=<scope item>, Scope-effect=<consequence>] — action` |
| Instrument | Metric / Alert-threshold | `[Instrument: Metric=<measurable>, Alert-threshold=<trigger value>] — action` |

This taxonomy is closed. No type-class label outside this set may be used in any Mitigation cell.

---

### Phase 0b — Risk Register Schema Declaration (Pre-Population Field List — Governs All Tables)

Declare the row schema before any row is populated. No row in Table 1 (Phase 1) or Table 2 (Phase 1b and Phase 2) is written before this phase completes. Every row in every table draws from this field list. No columns are added during Phase 1, Phase 1b, or Phase 2.

**Table 2 Row Schema — Dimensional Risk (Base Schema):**

| Field Name | Cell Constraint | Applies To |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Risk-ID | Sequential identifier: D-01, D-02, ... | All Table 2 rows |
| Dimension | Exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values. | All rows |
| Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW. No other values. | All rows |
| Likelihood | IF-THEN form: IF [named condition], THEN this risk activates. Bare labels are violations. | All rows |
| Mitigation | `[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action`. Drawn from Phase 0 taxonomy. | All rows |
| Type-Class | Exactly one of: Spike \| Validate \| Gate \| Contract \| Cut \| Instrument. No other values. | All rows |

**Table 1 Schema Extension — Inertia Entry (Extends Base Schema with Named Substitutions):**

The inertia entry (INERTIA-01) draws from the base schema above with the following named field substitutions. Likelihood is replaced by three inertia-specific fields; all other base fields are inherited unchanged.

| Field Name | Schema Relation | Cell Constraint |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Risk-ID | Inherited, fixed value | INERTIA-01 |
| Dimension | Inherited, fixed value | INERTIA |
| Severity | Inherited | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW |
| Status-quo Description | Substitution for Likelihood (1 of 3) | Name the concrete behavior or tool the status quo preserves and how adequately it serves current users |
| Inertia Condition | Substitution for Likelihood (2 of 3) | IF-THEN form: IF [named scenario or user behavior], THEN inertia risk activates — bare observations are violations |
| Decision Window | Extension (3 of 3) | Name the concrete deadline, forcing event, or milestone after which this inertia becomes harder to exit — "eventually" and "TBD" are violations |
| Mitigation | Inherited | `[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action` testing the inertia hypothesis |

**Forward-Reference Coverage Declaration:** This schema is consumed by three generation phases: Phase 1 (uses the Table 1 Schema Extension declared above), Phase 1b (uses the Table 2 Row Schema base for HIGH-seed rows), and Phase 2 (uses the Table 2 Row Schema base for expansion rows). Each of these phases references this schema by name. **No generation phase outside this list adds columns or defines its own row anatomy.**

This schema is complete and closed. Advance to Phase 0c.

---

### Phase 0c — Violation Type Taxonomy (Pre-phase Reference — Global Scope)

This block is a pre-phase reference block of equal structural weight to Phase 0 — both declare a closed vocabulary before any generation phase executes. Read this block before Phase 1. Apply it to every violation diagnosis in every phase. Five prohibition sites in this prompt cite this block by its full name: Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy. Four violation classes.

| Violation Class | Trigger Condition | Example in This Register |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Format | Cell value deviates from a stated vocabulary constraint (severity, dimension, type-class, or other field vocabulary) | Severity cell contains "Critical" instead of HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW |
| Schema | Row anatomy deviates from the Phase 0b field list — extra column added or required field omitted | "Notes" column added to Table 2 outside Phase 0b declaration |
| Boundary | Content violates a declared phase boundary constraint | HIGH-severity row added in Phase 2; Phase 1b entry revised during a Phase 2b repair loop |
| Quality | Prohibited phrase found in a Mitigation cell — vague language not replaced by a typed concrete action | "monitor closely" present in a Mitigation cell after Phase 2a scan |

The taxonomy closure consists of two sentences in canonical sequence. The state sentence comes first: "This taxonomy is closed." The use-site constraint sentence comes second: "No violation category outside this list may be named at any prohibition site." Reversing this order is a schema violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy).

This taxonomy is closed. No violation category outside this list may be named at any prohibition site.

Advance to Phase 1.

---

### Phase 1 — Table 1: Inertia Risk (Mandatory — Schema from Phase 0b — Never Suppressed)

The inertia risk is the risk that the status quo was sufficient and this feature was unnecessary. Produce a single-row table using the Table 1 Schema Extension declared in Phase 0b (7 fields). This table appears in all output regardless of any AMEND directive.

Populate each field per Phase 0b constraints. No new columns. No omitted fields.

---

### Phase 1b — HIGH-Seed Step (Seed ONE HIGH Row Per Active Dimension — Completes Before Phase 2)

Before any MEDIUM or LOW rows exist, seed the HIGH foundation of the register using the Table 2 Row Schema from Phase 0b.

For each active dimension in scope — all five (Technical, Market, Compliance, Dependency, Timeline) unless AMEND restricts the set — produce exactly one HIGH-severity row. Write only HIGH rows here. Do not write any MEDIUM or LOW rows in this step.

**Phase 1b completion gate:** Count active dimensions. Count HIGH rows produced here. They must match. If any active dimension lacks a HIGH row, add it before advancing. Do not proceed to Phase 2 with a gap.

Phase 2 inherits these seeded rows and expands around them. Phase 2b confirms the per-dimension HIGH coverage guaranteed here.

---

### Phase 2 — Table 2: Dimensional Risk Register (Schema from Phase 0b — Minimum 7 Rows)

**Add MEDIUM and LOW rows to the seeded HIGH rows from Phase 1b.** All active dimensions must be represented. HIGH rows from Phase 1b are already present — do not duplicate them. Add rows until the total Table 2 row count (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions) reaches **7 rows minimum**.

**Do not add HIGH-severity rows in Phase 2 — all HIGH coverage is provided exclusively by Phase 1b. Adding a HIGH-severity row here is a format violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy).**

Use the Table 2 Row Schema from Phase 0b. No columns beyond the Phase 0b field list. No field omissions.

Count total rows (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions). Minimum required: **7 rows**.

If fewer than 7 total rows:

-> **Repair Loop A** — Row-count deficit: Return to Phase 2. Add MEDIUM or LOW entries for under-populated dimensions until total count reaches 7. Re-confirm before Phase 2a.

Final row order across Phase 1b + Phase 2: HIGH rows first, MEDIUM second, LOW third.

---

### Phase 2a — Mitigation Quality Gate

Scan all Mitigation cells in Table 1 (Phase 1), Table 2 Phase 1b rows, and Table 2 Phase 2 rows for these prohibited phrases:

1. "monitor closely" / 2. "keep an eye on" / 3. "revisit later" / 4. "consider alternatives" / 5. "be careful" / 6. "watch for" / 7. "ensure adequate"

If any cell contains one of the seven phrases:

-> **Repair Loop B** — Quality violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy): Replace the prohibited phrase in the affected cell with a typed concrete action from the Phase 0 taxonomy. Key=value sub-field pairs required. Re-execute Phase 2a.

Phase 2a terminates when zero instances of all seven phrases are found in a full scan.

---

### Phase 2b — Type Diversity Audit (Standalone Phase — Do Not Merge with Any Other Step)

Count distinct Type-Class labels across Table 1 (Phase 1), Table 2 Phase 1b rows, and Table 2 Phase 2 rows. Minimum required: **3 distinct labels**.

**This audit does not repair per-dimension HIGH coverage (which Phase 1b guarantees) — its scope is type-class distribution only.** A deficit here means the register has type monoculture, not a HIGH coverage gap. **Do not revise Phase 1b entries or add HIGH rows to address a type-diversity deficit.**

If fewer than 3 distinct Type-Class labels:

-> **Repair Loop C** — Type-diversity deficit: Return to Phase 2. Revise mitigation entries — prioritize LOW and MEDIUM rows — until 3 distinct Type-Class labels are present. Re-execute Phase 2b.

Phase 2b terminates when count reaches 3 or greater. Record:

> **Type distribution**: Spike (N), Validate (N), Gate (N), Contract (N), Cut (N), Instrument (N)

---

### Phase 3 — Table 3: Risk Interdependencies (Minimum 3 Rows)

Produce a table titled **Risk Interdependencies** using the schema below:

| Column | Cell Constraint |
|--------|-----------------|
| From-Risk-ID | Risk-ID from Table 1 or Table 2 |
| To-Risk-ID | Risk-ID from Table 1 or Table 2 |
| Trigger Condition | Named activation event — IF [From-Risk activates by its stated condition]; this is a dedicated column, not embedded in severity cells |
| From-Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW — severity of To-Risk *before* From-Risk fires |
| To-Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW — severity of To-Risk *when* From-Risk fires |

From-Severity and To-Severity are each vocabulary-constrained to {HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW} — prose, blank, or compound values are format violations (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy). Trigger Condition is a discrete named field, not embedded in severity cells.

---

### Phase 4 — Interdependency Count Gate (Minimum 3 Rows)

Count rows in Phase 3. Minimum required: **3**.

If fewer than 3:

-> **Repair Loop D** — Interdependency-count deficit: Return to Phase 2. Add or decompose risk entries until the register supports 3 distinct compound-risk pairings. Re-execute Phase 3 and Phase 4.

Phase 4 terminates when Phase 3 contains at least 3 rows.

---

### Phase 5 — Final Output Assembly

Output in this order:

1. **AMEND Scope Declaration** (Phase 0a — if present; includes Active Dimensions and Suppressed Dimensions)
2. **Table 1** — Inertia Risk (7-column schema with Decision Window)
3. **Table 2** — Dimensional Risk Register (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions, HIGH rows first, all columns vocabulary-constrained)
4. **Table 3** — Risk Interdependencies (Trigger Condition + From-Severity + To-Severity columns)
5. **Type distribution** record from Phase 2b

## V-03 — Single axis: Prohibition site enumeration — count-bounded citation escalated to count-plus-site-list

**Hypothesis**: R18 V-03/V-04/V-05 introduced a count-bounded citation: "Five prohibition sites in this prompt cite this block by its full name: Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy." This is stronger than "Every prohibition site" (unbounded) but still requires scanning the full prompt to verify. V-03 escalates further: after the count, the five sites are listed by phase location and their trigger text. A reviewer can now verify coverage by comparing the enumerated list against the prompt phases without scanning — the list is a self-contained audit trail. If count-plus-enumeration becomes required (v19 C-57 candidate), count-alone would be insufficient. All other structure is identical to R18 V-05 — ordering meta-rule and bi-directional parity are retained.

---

You are a risk analyst. Execute each phase below in strict sequence. Every phase is mandatory. Every column constraint is enforced — a cell value outside the stated vocabulary is a format violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy). All repair loops are self-healing: execute the repair instruction, then re-run from the named phase.

**Feature or decision:** {{topic}}

**AMEND check: If an AMEND directive accompanies this topic, execute Phase 0a first. Phase 0a is a closed precondition — Phase 0 (taxonomy activation), Phase 0b (schema declaration), Phase 0c (violation taxonomy activation), Phase 1 (inertia registration), Phase 1b (HIGH-seed), Phase 2 (register build), Phase 2a (quality gate), Phase 2b (diversity audit), Phase 3 (interdependency build), and Phase 4 (count gate) are role-activating phases that do not begin until Phase 0a produces and confirms the AMEND Scope Declaration. If no AMEND directive is present, skip Phase 0a and begin at Phase 0.**

---

### Phase 0a — AMEND Resolution (Role-Activation Gate — Completes Before Any Role Activates)

Phase 0a is mandatory when an AMEND directive is present. This phase is the only precondition phase. No table is seeded, no role activates, no register phase begins until this phase produces and confirms the AMEND Scope Declaration. Every subsequent phase inherits the confirmed scope from this output.

Produce the **AMEND Scope Declaration** as this phase's sole output before any other content:

| Field | Constraint |
|-------|------------|
| **Active Dimensions** | Name every dimension retained for Table 2. Each value must be exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values permitted. |
| **Suppressed Dimensions** | Name every dimension excluded from Table 2 by this AMEND directive. Each value must be exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values permitted. |

Completeness constraint: Every member of {Technical, Market, Compliance, Dependency, Timeline} appears in exactly one field. No omissions. No duplicates. No values outside this set in either field.

The inertia entry (Table 1) is not subject to AMEND scope reduction. It does not appear in either field.

Phase 0a is complete. Confirmed scope is locked. Advance to Phase 0.

---

### Phase 0 — Mitigation Type Taxonomy (Pre-phase Reference — Global Scope)

This block is a pre-phase reference block of equal structural weight to Phase 0c — both declare a closed vocabulary before any generation phase executes. Read this block before Phase 0b. Apply it to every Mitigation cell in every phase. Taxonomy is complete and closed. Six classes only. No labels outside this set are permitted anywhere.

**Required Mitigation cell format:**
```
[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action
```
Cells reading `[Spike]`, `[Gate: check this]`, or any form without explicit key=value pairs are format violations (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy). Rewrite before advancing.

| Type Class | Required Sub-fields | Inline cell format |
|------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Spike | Unknown / Time-box | `[Spike: Unknown=<named gap>, Time-box=<duration>] — action` |
| Validate | Assumption / Method | `[Validate: Assumption=<belief>, Method=<test method>] — action` |
| Gate | Criterion | `[Gate: Criterion=<named condition>] — action` |
| Contract | Party / Commitment | `[Contract: Party=<counterparty>, Commitment=<obligation>] — action` |
| Cut | Element / Scope-effect | `[Cut: Element=<scope item>, Scope-effect=<consequence>] — action` |
| Instrument | Metric / Alert-threshold | `[Instrument: Metric=<measurable>, Alert-threshold=<trigger value>] — action` |

---

### Phase 0b — Risk Register Schema Declaration (Pre-Population Field List — Governs All Tables)

Declare the row schema before any row is populated. No row in Table 1 (Phase 1) or Table 2 (Phase 1b and Phase 2) is written before this phase completes. Every row in every table draws from this field list. No columns are added during Phase 1, Phase 1b, or Phase 2.

**Table 2 Row Schema — Dimensional Risk (Base Schema):**

| Field Name | Cell Constraint | Applies To |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Risk-ID | Sequential identifier: D-01, D-02, ... | All Table 2 rows |
| Dimension | Exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values. | All rows |
| Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW. No other values. | All rows |
| Likelihood | IF-THEN form: IF [named condition], THEN this risk activates. Bare labels are violations. | All rows |
| Mitigation | `[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action`. Drawn from Phase 0 taxonomy. | All rows |
| Type-Class | Exactly one of: Spike \| Validate \| Gate \| Contract \| Cut \| Instrument. No other values. | All rows |

**Table 1 Schema Extension — Inertia Entry (Extends Base Schema with Named Substitutions):**

The inertia entry (INERTIA-01) draws from the base schema above with the following named field substitutions. Likelihood is replaced by three inertia-specific fields; all other base fields are inherited unchanged.

| Field Name | Schema Relation | Cell Constraint |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Risk-ID | Inherited, fixed value | INERTIA-01 |
| Dimension | Inherited, fixed value | INERTIA |
| Severity | Inherited | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW |
| Status-quo Description | Substitution for Likelihood (1 of 3) | Name the concrete behavior or tool the status quo preserves and how adequately it serves current users |
| Inertia Condition | Substitution for Likelihood (2 of 3) | IF-THEN form: IF [named scenario or user behavior], THEN inertia risk activates — bare observations are violations |
| Decision Window | Extension (3 of 3) | Name the concrete deadline, forcing event, or milestone after which this inertia becomes harder to exit — "eventually" and "TBD" are violations |
| Mitigation | Inherited | `[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action` testing the inertia hypothesis |

**Forward-Reference Coverage Declaration:** This schema is consumed by three generation phases: Phase 1 (uses the Table 1 Schema Extension declared above), Phase 1b (uses the Table 2 Row Schema base for HIGH-seed rows), and Phase 2 (uses the Table 2 Row Schema base for expansion rows). Each of these phases references this schema by name. **No generation phase outside this list adds columns or defines its own row anatomy.**

This schema is complete and closed. Advance to Phase 0c.

---

### Phase 0c — Violation Type Taxonomy (Pre-phase Reference — Global Scope)

This block is a pre-phase reference block of equal structural weight to Phase 0 — both declare a closed vocabulary before any generation phase executes. Read this block before Phase 1. Apply it to every violation diagnosis in every phase. Five prohibition sites in this prompt cite this block by its full name: Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy, identified by phase location: (1) prompt opening sentence — "a cell value outside the stated vocabulary is a format violation"; (2) Phase 0 Mitigation format note — cells not in key=value form "are format violations"; (3) Phase 2 HIGH boundary — "Adding a HIGH-severity row here is a format violation"; (4) Phase 2a repair loop — "Quality violation"; (5) Phase 3 severity columns — "prose, blank, or compound values are format violations". Four violation classes.

| Violation Class | Trigger Condition | Example in This Register |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Format | Cell value deviates from a stated vocabulary constraint (severity, dimension, type-class, or other field vocabulary) | Severity cell contains "Critical" instead of HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW |
| Schema | Row anatomy deviates from the Phase 0b field list — extra column added or required field omitted | "Notes" column added to Table 2 outside Phase 0b declaration |
| Boundary | Content violates a declared phase boundary constraint | HIGH-severity row added in Phase 2; Phase 1b entry revised during a Phase 2b repair loop |
| Quality | Prohibited phrase found in a Mitigation cell — vague language not replaced by a typed concrete action | "monitor closely" present in a Mitigation cell after Phase 2a scan |

The taxonomy closure consists of two sentences in canonical sequence. The state sentence comes first: "This taxonomy is closed." The use-site constraint sentence comes second: "No violation category outside this list may be named at any prohibition site." Reversing this order is a schema violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy).

This taxonomy is closed. No violation category outside this list may be named at any prohibition site.

Advance to Phase 1.

---

### Phase 1 — Table 1: Inertia Risk (Mandatory — Schema from Phase 0b — Never Suppressed)

The inertia risk is the risk that the status quo was sufficient and this feature was unnecessary. Produce a single-row table using the Table 1 Schema Extension declared in Phase 0b (7 fields). This table appears in all output regardless of any AMEND directive.

Populate each field per Phase 0b constraints. No new columns. No omitted fields.

---

### Phase 1b — HIGH-Seed Step (Seed ONE HIGH Row Per Active Dimension — Completes Before Phase 2)

Before any MEDIUM or LOW rows exist, seed the HIGH foundation of the register using the Table 2 Row Schema from Phase 0b.

For each active dimension in scope — all five (Technical, Market, Compliance, Dependency, Timeline) unless AMEND restricts the set — produce exactly one HIGH-severity row. Write only HIGH rows here. Do not write any MEDIUM or LOW rows in this step.

**Phase 1b completion gate:** Count active dimensions. Count HIGH rows produced here. They must match. If any active dimension lacks a HIGH row, add it before advancing. Do not proceed to Phase 2 with a gap.

Phase 2 inherits these seeded rows and expands around them. Phase 2b confirms the per-dimension HIGH coverage guaranteed here.

---

### Phase 2 — Table 2: Dimensional Risk Register (Schema from Phase 0b — Minimum 7 Rows)

**Add MEDIUM and LOW rows to the seeded HIGH rows from Phase 1b.** All active dimensions must be represented. HIGH rows from Phase 1b are already present — do not duplicate them. Add rows until the total Table 2 row count (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions) reaches **7 rows minimum**.

**Do not add HIGH-severity rows in Phase 2 — all HIGH coverage is provided exclusively by Phase 1b. Adding a HIGH-severity row here is a format violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy).**

Use the Table 2 Row Schema from Phase 0b. No columns beyond the Phase 0b field list. No field omissions.

Count total rows (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions). Minimum required: **7 rows**.

If fewer than 7 total rows:

-> **Repair Loop A** — Row-count deficit: Return to Phase 2. Add MEDIUM or LOW entries for under-populated dimensions until total count reaches 7. Re-confirm before Phase 2a.

Final row order across Phase 1b + Phase 2: HIGH rows first, MEDIUM second, LOW third.

---

### Phase 2a — Mitigation Quality Gate

Scan all Mitigation cells in Table 1 (Phase 1), Table 2 Phase 1b rows, and Table 2 Phase 2 rows for these prohibited phrases:

1. "monitor closely" / 2. "keep an eye on" / 3. "revisit later" / 4. "consider alternatives" / 5. "be careful" / 6. "watch for" / 7. "ensure adequate"

If any cell contains one of the seven phrases:

-> **Repair Loop B** — Quality violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy): Replace the prohibited phrase in the affected cell with a typed concrete action from the Phase 0 taxonomy. Key=value sub-field pairs required. Re-execute Phase 2a.

Phase 2a terminates when zero instances of all seven phrases are found in a full scan.

---

### Phase 2b — Type Diversity Audit (Standalone Phase — Do Not Merge with Any Other Step)

Count distinct Type-Class labels across Table 1 (Phase 1), Table 2 Phase 1b rows, and Table 2 Phase 2 rows. Minimum required: **3 distinct labels**.

**This audit does not repair per-dimension HIGH coverage (which Phase 1b guarantees) — its scope is type-class distribution only.** A deficit here means the register has type monoculture, not a HIGH coverage gap. **Do not revise Phase 1b entries or add HIGH rows to address a type-diversity deficit.**

If fewer than 3 distinct Type-Class labels:

-> **Repair Loop C** — Type-diversity deficit: Return to Phase 2. Revise mitigation entries — prioritize LOW and MEDIUM rows — until 3 distinct Type-Class labels are present. Re-execute Phase 2b.

Phase 2b terminates when count reaches 3 or greater. Record:

> **Type distribution**: Spike (N), Validate (N), Gate (N), Contract (N), Cut (N), Instrument (N)

---

### Phase 3 — Table 3: Risk Interdependencies (Minimum 3 Rows)

Produce a table titled **Risk Interdependencies** using the schema below:

| Column | Cell Constraint |
|--------|-----------------|
| From-Risk-ID | Risk-ID from Table 1 or Table 2 |
| To-Risk-ID | Risk-ID from Table 1 or Table 2 |
| Trigger Condition | Named activation event — IF [From-Risk activates by its stated condition]; this is a dedicated column, not embedded in severity cells |
| From-Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW — severity of To-Risk *before* From-Risk fires |
| To-Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW — severity of To-Risk *when* From-Risk fires |

From-Severity and To-Severity are each vocabulary-constrained to {HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW} — prose, blank, or compound values are format violations (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy). Trigger Condition is a discrete named field, not embedded in severity cells.

---

### Phase 4 — Interdependency Count Gate (Minimum 3 Rows)

Count rows in Phase 3. Minimum required: **3**.

If fewer than 3:

-> **Repair Loop D** — Interdependency-count deficit: Return to Phase 2. Add or decompose risk entries until the register supports 3 distinct compound-risk pairings. Re-execute Phase 3 and Phase 4.

Phase 4 terminates when Phase 3 contains at least 3 rows.

---

### Phase 5 — Final Output Assembly

Output in this order:

1. **AMEND Scope Declaration** (Phase 0a — if present; includes Active Dimensions and Suppressed Dimensions)
2. **Table 1** — Inertia Risk (7-column schema with Decision Window)
3. **Table 2** — Dimensional Risk Register (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions, HIGH rows first, all columns vocabulary-constrained)
4. **Table 3** — Risk Interdependencies (Trigger Condition + From-Severity + To-Severity columns)
5. **Type distribution** record from Phase 2b

---

## V-04 — Combination: Phase 0 parallel closure sentences + prohibition site enumeration (V-02 + V-03)

**Hypothesis**: V-02 and V-03 are structurally independent improvements — Phase 0 closure sentence affects the mitigation taxonomy block, site enumeration affects the violation taxonomy citation. V-04 applies both simultaneously to test whether they compound: a prompt where both peer blocks carry explicit closure sentences (C-56 probe) AND the citation is enumerated by site location (C-57 probe) has qualitatively higher auditability than either property alone. A reviewer can now verify (a) the Phase 0 closure matches Phase 0c's closure structure, and (b) the five citation sites correspond to the five locations listed in the enumeration, without any scanning. All other structure is identical to R18 V-05.

If no AMEND directive is present, skip Phase 0a and begin at Phase 0.**

---

### Phase 0a — AMEND Resolution (Role-Activation Gate — Completes Before Any Role Activates)

Phase 0a is mandatory when an AMEND directive is present. This phase is the only precondition phase. No table is seeded, no role activates, no register phase begins until this phase produces and confirms the AMEND Scope Declaration. Every subsequent phase inherits the confirmed scope from this output.

Produce the **AMEND Scope Declaration** as this phase's sole output before any other content:

| Field | Constraint |
|-------|------------|
| **Active Dimensions** | Name every dimension retained for Table 2. Each value must be exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values permitted. |

Completeness constraint: Every member of {Technical, Market, Compliance, Dependency, Timeline} appears in exactly one field. No omissions. No duplicates. No values outside this set in either field.

The inertia entry (Table 1) is not subject to AMEND scope reduction. It does not appear in either field.

Phase 0a is complete. Confirmed scope is locked. Advance to Phase 0.

---

### Phase 0 — Mitigation Type Taxonomy (Pre-phase Reference — Global Scope)

This block is a pre-phase reference block of equal structural weight to Phase 0c — both declare a closed vocabulary before any generation phase executes. Read this block before Phase 0b. Apply it to every Mitigation cell in every phase. Taxonomy is complete and closed. Six classes only. No labels outside this set are permitted anywhere.

**Required Mitigation cell format:**
```
[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action
```
Cells reading `[Spike]`, `[Gate: check this]`, or any form without explicit key=value pairs are format violations (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy). Rewrite before advancing.

| Type Class | Required Sub-fields | Inline cell format |
|------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Spike | Unknown / Time-box | `[Spike: Unknown=<named gap>, Time-box=<duration>] — action` |
| Validate | Assumption / Method | `[Validate: Assumption=<belief>, Method=<test method>] — action` |
| Gate | Criterion | `[Gate: Criterion=<named condition>] — action` |
| Contract | Party / Commitment | `[Contract: Party=<counterparty>, Commitment=<obligation>] — action` |
| Cut | Element / Scope-effect | `[Cut: Element=<scope item>, Scope-effect=<consequence>] — action` |
| Instrument | Metric / Alert-threshold | `[Instrument: Metric=<measurable>, Alert-threshold=<trigger value>] — action` |

This taxonomy is closed. No type-class label outside this set may be used in any Mitigation cell.

---

### Phase 0b — Risk Register Schema Declaration (Pre-Population Field List — Governs All Tables)

Declare the row schema before any row is populated. No row in Table 1 (Phase 1) or Table 2 (Phase 1b and Phase 2) is written before this phase completes. Every row in every table draws from this field list. No columns are added during Phase 1, Phase 1b, or Phase 2.

**Table 2 Row Schema — Dimensional Risk (Base Schema):**

| Field Name | Cell Constraint | Applies To |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Risk-ID | Sequential identifier: D-01, D-02, ... | All Table 2 rows |
| Dimension | Exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values. | All rows |
| Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW. No other values. | All rows |
| Likelihood | IF-THEN form: IF [named condition], THEN this risk activates. Bare labels are violations. | All rows |
| Mitigation | `[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action`. Drawn from Phase 0 taxonomy. | All rows |
| Type-Class | Exactly one of: Spike \| Validate \| Gate \| Contract \| Cut \| Instrument. No other values. | All rows |

**Table 1 Schema Extension — Inertia Entry (Extends Base Schema with Named Substitutions):**

The inertia entry (INERTIA-01) draws from the base schema above with the following named field substitutions. Likelihood is replaced by three inertia-specific fields; all other base fields are inherited unchanged.

| Field Name | Schema Relation | Cell Constraint |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Risk-ID | Inherited, fixed value | INERTIA-01 |
| Dimension | Inherited, fixed value | INERTIA |
| Severity | Inherited | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW |
| Status-quo Description | Substitution for Likelihood (1 of 3) | Name the concrete behavior or tool the status quo preserves and how adequately it serves current users |
| Inertia Condition | Substitution for Likelihood (2 of 3) | IF-THEN form: IF [named scenario or user behavior], THEN inertia risk activates — bare observations are violations |
| Decision Window | Extension (3 of 3) | Name the concrete deadline, forcing event, or milestone after which this inertia becomes harder to exit — "eventually" and "TBD" are violations |
| Mitigation | Inherited | `[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action` testing the inertia hypothesis |

**Forward-Reference Coverage Declaration:** This schema is consumed by three generation phases: Phase 1 (uses the Table 1 Schema Extension declared above), Phase 1b (uses the Table 2 Row Schema base for HIGH-seed rows), and Phase 2 (uses the Table 2 Row Schema base for expansion rows). Each of these phases references this schema by name. **No generation phase outside this list adds columns or defines its own row anatomy.**

This schema is complete and closed. Advance to Phase 0c.

---

### Phase 0c — Violation Type Taxonomy (Pre-phase Reference — Global Scope)

This block is a pre-phase reference block of equal structural weight to Phase 0 — both declare a closed vocabulary before any generation phase executes. Read this block before Phase 1. Apply it to every violation diagnosis in every phase. Five prohibition sites in this prompt cite this block by its full name: Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy, identified by phase location: (1) prompt opening sentence — "a cell value outside the stated vocabulary is a format violation"; (2) Phase 0 Mitigation format note — cells not in key=value form "are format violations"; (3) Phase 2 HIGH boundary — "Adding a HIGH-severity row here is a format violation"; (4) Phase 2a repair loop — "Quality violation"; (5) Phase 3 severity columns — "prose, blank, or compound values are format violations". Four violation classes.

| Violation Class | Trigger Condition | Example in This Register |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Format | Cell value deviates from a stated vocabulary constraint (severity, dimension, type-class, or other field vocabulary) | Severity cell contains "Critical" instead of HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW |
| Schema | Row anatomy deviates from the Phase 0b field list — extra column added or required field omitted | "Notes" column added to Table 2 outside Phase 0b declaration |
| Boundary | Content violates a declared phase boundary constraint | HIGH-severity row added in Phase 2; Phase 1b entry revised during a Phase 2b repair loop |
| Quality | Prohibited phrase found in a Mitigation cell — vague language not replaced by a typed concrete action | "monitor closely" present in a Mitigation cell after Phase 2a scan |

The taxonomy closure consists of two sentences in canonical sequence. The state sentence comes first: "This taxonomy is closed." The use-site constraint sentence comes second: "No violation category outside this list may be named at any prohibition site." Reversing this order is a schema violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy).

This taxonomy is closed. No violation category outside this list may be named at any prohibition site.

Advance to Phase 1.

---

### Phase 1 — Table 1: Inertia Risk (Mandatory — Schema from Phase 0b — Never Suppressed)

The inertia risk is the risk that the status quo was sufficient and this feature was unnecessary. Produce a single-row table using the Table 1 Schema Extension declared in Phase 0b (7 fields). This table appears in all output regardless of any AMEND directive.

Populate each field per Phase 0b constraints. No new columns. No omitted fields.

---

### Phase 1b — HIGH-Seed Step (Seed ONE HIGH Row Per Active Dimension — Completes Before Phase 2)

Before any MEDIUM or LOW rows exist, seed the HIGH foundation of the register using the Table 2 Row Schema from Phase 0b.

For each active dimension in scope — all five (Technical, Market, Compliance, Dependency, Timeline) unless AMEND restricts the set — produce exactly one HIGH-severity row. Write only HIGH rows here. Do not write any MEDIUM or LOW rows in this step.

**Phase 1b completion gate:** Count active dimensions. Count HIGH rows produced here. They must match. If any active dimension lacks a HIGH row, add it before advancing. Do not proceed to Phase 2 with a gap.

Phase 2 inherits these seeded rows and expands around them. Phase 2b confirms the per-dimension HIGH coverage guaranteed here.

---

### Phase 2 — Table 2: Dimensional Risk Register (Schema from Phase 0b — Minimum 7 Rows)

**Add MEDIUM and LOW rows to the seeded HIGH rows from Phase 1b.** All active dimensions must be represented. HIGH rows from Phase 1b are already present — do not duplicate them. Add rows until the total Table 2 row count (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions) reaches **7 rows minimum**.

**Do not add HIGH-severity rows in Phase 2 — all HIGH coverage is provided exclusively by Phase 1b. Adding a HIGH-severity row here is a format violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy).**

Use the Table 2 Row Schema from Phase 0b. No columns beyond the Phase 0b field list. No field omissions.

Count total rows (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions). Minimum required: **7 rows**.

If fewer than 7 total rows:

-> **Repair Loop A** — Row-count deficit: Return to Phase 2. Add MEDIUM or LOW entries for under-populated dimensions until total count reaches 7. Re-confirm before Phase 2a.

Final row order across Phase 1b + Phase 2: HIGH rows first, MEDIUM second, LOW third.

---

### Phase 2a — Mitigation Quality Gate

Scan all Mitigation cells in Table 1 (Phase 1), Table 2 Phase 1b rows, and Table 2 Phase 2 rows for these prohibited phrases:

1. "monitor closely" / 2. "keep an eye on" / 3. "revisit later" / 4. "consider alternatives" / 5. "be careful" / 6. "watch for" / 7. "ensure adequate"

If any cell contains one of the seven phrases:

-> **Repair Loop B** — Quality violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy): Replace the prohibited phrase in the affected cell with a typed concrete action from the Phase 0 taxonomy. Key=value sub-field pairs required. Re-execute Phase 2a.

Phase 2a terminates when zero instances of all seven phrases are found in a full scan.

---

### Phase 2b — Type Diversity Audit (Standalone Phase — Do Not Merge with Any Other Step)

Count distinct Type-Class labels across Table 1 (Phase 1), Table 2 Phase 1b rows, and Table 2 Phase 2 rows. Minimum required: **3 distinct labels**.

**This audit does not repair per-dimension HIGH coverage (which Phase 1b guarantees) — its scope is type-class distribution only.** A deficit here means the register has type monoculture, not a HIGH coverage gap. **Do not revise Phase 1b entries or add HIGH rows to address a type-diversity deficit.**

If fewer than 3 distinct Type-Class labels:

-> **Repair Loop C** — Type-diversity deficit: Return to Phase 2. Revise mitigation entries — prioritize LOW and MEDIUM rows — until 3 distinct Type-Class labels are present. Re-execute Phase 2b.

Phase 2b terminates when count reaches 3 or greater. Record:

> **Type distribution**: Spike (N), Validate (N), Gate (N), Contract (N), Cut (N), Instrument (N)

---

### Phase 3 — Table 3: Risk Interdependencies (Minimum 3 Rows)

Produce a table titled **Risk Interdependencies** using the schema below:

| Column | Cell Constraint |
|--------|-----------------|
| From-Risk-ID | Risk-ID from Table 1 or Table 2 |
| To-Risk-ID | Risk-ID from Table 1 or Table 2 |
| Trigger Condition | Named activation event — IF [From-Risk activates by its stated condition]; this is a dedicated column, not embedded in severity cells |
| From-Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW — severity of To-Risk *before* From-Risk fires |
| To-Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW — severity of To-Risk *when* From-Risk fires |

From-Severity and To-Severity are each vocabulary-constrained to {HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW} — prose, blank, or compound values are format violations (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy). Trigger Condition is a discrete named field, not embedded in severity cells.

### Phase 4 — Interdependency Count Gate (Minimum 3 Rows)

Count rows in Phase 3. Minimum required: **3**.

If fewer than 3:

-> **Repair Loop D** — Interdependency-count deficit: Return to Phase 2. Add or decompose risk entries until the register supports 3 distinct compound-risk pairings. Re-execute Phase 3 and Phase 4.

Phase 4 terminates when Phase 3 contains at least 3 rows.

### Phase 5 — Final Output Assembly

Output in this order:

1. **AMEND Scope Declaration** (Phase 0a — if present; includes Active Dimensions and Suppressed Dimensions)
2. **Table 1** — Inertia Risk (7-column schema with Decision Window)
3. **Table 2** — Dimensional Risk Register (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions, HIGH rows first, all columns vocabulary-constrained)
4. **Table 3** — Risk Interdependencies (Trigger Condition + From-Severity + To-Severity columns)
5. **Type distribution** record from Phase 2b

## V-05 — Full combination: Phase 0 parallel closure sentences + prohibition site enumeration + global closure-ordering rule (V-02 + V-03 + ordering rule extended to both reference blocks)

**Hypothesis**: V-05 applies all three positive axes and escalates the ordering rule from Phase-0c-scoped to globally scoped. R18 V-05 declared the ordering rule inside Phase 0c: "The taxonomy closure consists of two sentences in canonical sequence..." This rule governs Phase 0c's closure but makes no claim about Phase 0's closure (which has none in baseline). V-05 (a) adds Phase 0 closure sentences (from V-02), (b) enumerates the citation sites (from V-03), and (c) makes the ordering rule a cross-block declaration applying to all reference block closures in the prompt: "All taxonomy closure declarations in this prompt consist of two sentences in canonical sequence: state sentence first, use-site constraint sentence second. This rule applies to Phase 0 and Phase 0c closures." The combined effect is maximum structural explicitness: both blocks carry symmetric closure sentences, the ordering rule is a global named invariant, and the citation is enumerated. If the global ordering rule is required (v19 C-58 candidate), per-block ordering rules would be insufficient. Expected: 184/184 on v18; this positions V-05 as the v19 baseline source candidate.

You are a risk analyst. Execute each phase below in strict sequence. Every phase is mandatory. Every column constraint is enforced — a cell value outside the stated vocabulary is a format violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy). All repair loops are self-healing: execute the repair instruction, then re-run from the named phase.

**Feature or decision:** {{topic}}

**AMEND check: If an AMEND directive accompanies this topic, execute Phase 0a first. Phase 0a is a closed precondition — Phase 0 (taxonomy activation), Phase 0b (schema declaration), Phase 0c (violation taxonomy activation), Phase 1 (inertia registration), Phase 1b (HIGH-seed), Phase 2 (register build), Phase 2a (quality gate), Phase 2b (diversity audit), Phase 3 (interdependency build), and Phase 4 (count gate) are role-activating phases that do not begin until Phase 0a produces and confirms the AMEND Scope Declaration. If no AMEND directive is present, skip Phase 0a and begin at Phase 0.**

---

### Phase 0a — AMEND Resolution (Role-Activation Gate — Completes Before Any Role Activates)

Phase 0a is mandatory when an AMEND directive is present. This phase is the only precondition phase. No table is seeded, no role activates, no register phase begins until this phase produces and confirms the AMEND Scope Declaration. Every subsequent phase inherits the confirmed scope from this output.

Produce the **AMEND Scope Declaration** as this phase's sole output before any other content:

| Field | Constraint |
|-------|------------|
| **Active Dimensions** | Name every dimension retained for Table 2. Each value must be exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values permitted. |
| **Suppressed Dimensions** | Name every dimension excluded from Table 2 by this AMEND directive. Each value must be exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values permitted. |

Completeness constraint: Every member of {Technical, Market, Compliance, Dependency, Timeline} appears in exactly one field. No omissions. No duplicates. No values outside this set in either field.

The inertia entry (Table 1) is not subject to AMEND scope reduction. It does not appear in either field.

Phase 0a is complete. Confirmed scope is locked. Advance to Phase 0.

---

### Phase 0 — Mitigation Type Taxonomy (Pre-phase Reference — Global Scope)

This block is a pre-phase reference block of equal structural weight to Phase 0c — both declare a closed vocabulary before any generation phase executes. Read this block before Phase 0b. Apply it to every Mitigation cell in every phase. Taxonomy is complete and closed. Six classes only. No labels outside this set are permitted anywhere.

**Required Mitigation cell format:**
```
[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action
```
Cells reading `[Spike]`, `[Gate: check this]`, or any form without explicit key=value pairs are format violations (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy). Rewrite before advancing.

| Type Class | Required Sub-fields | Inline cell format |
|------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Spike | Unknown / Time-box | `[Spike: Unknown=<named gap>, Time-box=<duration>] — action` |
| Validate | Assumption / Method | `[Validate: Assumption=<belief>, Method=<test method>] — action` |
| Gate | Criterion | `[Gate: Criterion=<named condition>] — action` |
| Contract | Party / Commitment | `[Contract: Party=<counterparty>, Commitment=<obligation>] — action` |
| Cut | Element / Scope-effect | `[Cut: Element=<scope item>, Scope-effect=<consequence>] — action` |
| Instrument | Metric / Alert-threshold | `[Instrument: Metric=<measurable>, Alert-threshold=<trigger value>] — action` |

This taxonomy is closed. No type-class label outside this set may be used in any Mitigation cell.

---

### Phase 0b — Risk Register Schema Declaration (Pre-Population Field List — Governs All Tables)

Declare the row schema before any row is populated. No row in Table 1 (Phase 1) or Table 2 (Phase 1b and Phase 2) is written before this phase completes. Every row in every table draws from this field list. No columns are added during Phase 1, Phase 1b, or Phase 2.

**Table 2 Row Schema — Dimensional Risk (Base Schema):**

| Field Name | Cell Constraint | Applies To |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Risk-ID | Sequential identifier: D-01, D-02, ... | All Table 2 rows |
| Dimension | Exactly one of: Technical \| Market \| Compliance \| Dependency \| Timeline. No other values. | All rows |
| Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW. No other values. | All rows |
| Likelihood | IF-THEN form: IF [named condition], THEN this risk activates. Bare labels are violations. | All rows |
| Mitigation | `[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action`. Drawn from Phase 0 taxonomy. | All rows |
| Type-Class | Exactly one of: Spike \| Validate \| Gate \| Contract \| Cut \| Instrument. No other values. | All rows |

**Table 1 Schema Extension — Inertia Entry (Extends Base Schema with Named Substitutions):**

The inertia entry (INERTIA-01) draws from the base schema above with the following named field substitutions. Likelihood is replaced by three inertia-specific fields; all other base fields are inherited unchanged.

| Field Name | Schema Relation | Cell Constraint |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Risk-ID | Inherited, fixed value | INERTIA-01 |
| Dimension | Inherited, fixed value | INERTIA |
| Severity | Inherited | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW |
| Status-quo Description | Substitution for Likelihood (1 of 3) | Name the concrete behavior or tool the status quo preserves and how adequately it serves current users |
| Inertia Condition | Substitution for Likelihood (2 of 3) | IF-THEN form: IF [named scenario or user behavior], THEN inertia risk activates — bare observations are violations |
| Decision Window | Extension (3 of 3) | Name the concrete deadline, forcing event, or milestone after which this inertia becomes harder to exit — "eventually" and "TBD" are violations |
| Mitigation | Inherited | `[Type-Class: sub-field=value, sub-field=value] — concrete action` testing the inertia hypothesis |

**Forward-Reference Coverage Declaration:** This schema is consumed by three generation phases: Phase 1 (uses the Table 1 Schema Extension declared above), Phase 1b (uses the Table 2 Row Schema base for HIGH-seed rows), and Phase 2 (uses the Table 2 Row Schema base for expansion rows). Each of these phases references this schema by name. **No generation phase outside this list adds columns or defines its own row anatomy.**

This schema is complete and closed. Advance to Phase 0c.

---

### Phase 0c — Violation Type Taxonomy (Pre-phase Reference — Global Scope)

This block is a pre-phase reference block of equal structural weight to Phase 0 — both declare a closed vocabulary before any generation phase executes. Read this block before Phase 1. Apply it to every violation diagnosis in every phase. Five prohibition sites in this prompt cite this block by its full name: Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy, identified by phase location: (1) prompt opening sentence — "a cell value outside the stated vocabulary is a format violation"; (2) Phase 0 Mitigation format note — cells not in key=value form "are format violations"; (3) Phase 2 HIGH boundary — "Adding a HIGH-severity row here is a format violation"; (4) Phase 2a repair loop — "Quality violation"; (5) Phase 3 severity columns — "prose, blank, or compound values are format violations". Four violation classes.

| Violation Class | Trigger Condition | Example in This Register |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Format | Cell value deviates from a stated vocabulary constraint (severity, dimension, type-class, or other field vocabulary) | Severity cell contains "Critical" instead of HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW |
| Schema | Row anatomy deviates from the Phase 0b field list — extra column added or required field omitted | "Notes" column added to Table 2 outside Phase 0b declaration |
| Boundary | Content violates a declared phase boundary constraint | HIGH-severity row added in Phase 2; Phase 1b entry revised during a Phase 2b repair loop |
| Quality | Prohibited phrase found in a Mitigation cell — vague language not replaced by a typed concrete action | "monitor closely" present in a Mitigation cell after Phase 2a scan |

All taxonomy closure declarations in this prompt consist of two sentences in canonical sequence: state sentence first ("This taxonomy is closed."), use-site constraint sentence second. This rule applies to Phase 0 and Phase 0c closures. Reversing this order at any closure site is a schema violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy).

This taxonomy is closed. No violation category outside this list may be named at any prohibition site.

Advance to Phase 1.

---

### Phase 1 — Table 1: Inertia Risk (Mandatory — Schema from Phase 0b — Never Suppressed)

The inertia risk is the risk that the status quo was sufficient and this feature was unnecessary. Produce a single-row table using the Table 1 Schema Extension declared in Phase 0b (7 fields). This table appears in all output regardless of any AMEND directive.

Populate each field per Phase 0b constraints. No new columns. No omitted fields.

---

### Phase 1b — HIGH-Seed Step (Seed ONE HIGH Row Per Active Dimension — Completes Before Phase 2)

Before any MEDIUM or LOW rows exist, seed the HIGH foundation of the register using the Table 2 Row Schema from Phase 0b.

For each active dimension in scope — all five (Technical, Market, Compliance, Dependency, Timeline) unless AMEND restricts the set — produce exactly one HIGH-severity row. Write only HIGH rows here. Do not write any MEDIUM or LOW rows in this step.

**Phase 1b completion gate:** Count active dimensions. Count HIGH rows produced here. They must match. If any active dimension lacks a HIGH row, add it before advancing. Do not proceed to Phase 2 with a gap.

Phase 2 inherits these seeded rows and expands around them. Phase 2b confirms the per-dimension HIGH coverage guaranteed here.

---

### Phase 2 — Table 2: Dimensional Risk Register (Schema from Phase 0b — Minimum 7 Rows)

**Add MEDIUM and LOW rows to the seeded HIGH rows from Phase 1b.** All active dimensions must be represented. HIGH rows from Phase 1b are already present — do not duplicate them. Add rows until the total Table 2 row count (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions) reaches **7 rows minimum**.

**Do not add HIGH-severity rows in Phase 2 — all HIGH coverage is provided exclusively by Phase 1b. Adding a HIGH-severity row here is a format violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy).**

Use the Table 2 Row Schema from Phase 0b. No columns beyond the Phase 0b field list. No field omissions.

Count total rows (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions). Minimum required: **7 rows**.

If fewer than 7 total rows:

-> **Repair Loop A** — Row-count deficit: Return to Phase 2. Add MEDIUM or LOW entries for under-populated dimensions until total count reaches 7. Re-confirm before Phase 2a.

Final row order across Phase 1b + Phase 2: HIGH rows first, MEDIUM second, LOW third.

---

### Phase 2a — Mitigation Quality Gate

Scan all Mitigation cells in Table 1 (Phase 1), Table 2 Phase 1b rows, and Table 2 Phase 2 rows for these prohibited phrases:

1. "monitor closely" / 2. "keep an eye on" / 3. "revisit later" / 4. "consider alternatives" / 5. "be careful" / 6. "watch for" / 7. "ensure adequate"

If any cell contains one of the seven phrases:

-> **Repair Loop B** — Quality violation (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy): Replace the prohibited phrase in the affected cell with a typed concrete action from the Phase 0 taxonomy. Key=value sub-field pairs required. Re-execute Phase 2a.

Phase 2a terminates when zero instances of all seven phrases are found in a full scan.

---

### Phase 2b — Type Diversity Audit (Standalone Phase — Do Not Merge with Any Other Step)

Count distinct Type-Class labels across Table 1 (Phase 1), Table 2 Phase 1b rows, and Table 2 Phase 2 rows. Minimum required: **3 distinct labels**.

**This audit does not repair per-dimension HIGH coverage (which Phase 1b guarantees) — its scope is type-class distribution only.** A deficit here means the register has type monoculture, not a HIGH coverage gap. **Do not revise Phase 1b entries or add HIGH rows to address a type-diversity deficit.**

If fewer than 3 distinct Type-Class labels:

-> **Repair Loop C** — Type-diversity deficit: Return to Phase 2. Revise mitigation entries — prioritize LOW and MEDIUM rows — until 3 distinct Type-Class labels are present. Re-execute Phase 2b.

Phase 2b terminates when count reaches 3 or greater. Record:

> **Type distribution**: Spike (N), Validate (N), Gate (N), Contract (N), Cut (N), Instrument (N)

---

### Phase 3 — Table 3: Risk Interdependencies (Minimum 3 Rows)

Produce a table titled **Risk Interdependencies** using the schema below:

| Column | Cell Constraint |
|--------|-----------------|
| From-Risk-ID | Risk-ID from Table 1 or Table 2 |
| To-Risk-ID | Risk-ID from Table 1 or Table 2 |
| Trigger Condition | Named activation event — IF [From-Risk activates by its stated condition]; this is a dedicated column, not embedded in severity cells |
| From-Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW — severity of To-Risk *before* From-Risk fires |
| To-Severity | Exactly one of: HIGH \| MEDIUM \| LOW — severity of To-Risk *when* From-Risk fires |

From-Severity and To-Severity are each vocabulary-constrained to {HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW} — prose, blank, or compound values are format violations (Phase 0c Violation Taxonomy). Trigger Condition is a discrete named field, not embedded in severity cells.

---

### Phase 4 — Interdependency Count Gate (Minimum 3 Rows)

Count rows in Phase 3. Minimum required: **3**.

If fewer than 3:

-> **Repair Loop D** — Interdependency-count deficit: Return to Phase 2. Add or decompose risk entries until the register supports 3 distinct compound-risk pairings. Re-execute Phase 3 and Phase 4.

Phase 4 terminates when Phase 3 contains at least 3 rows.

---

### Phase 5 — Final Output Assembly

Output in this order:

1. **AMEND Scope Declaration** (Phase 0a — if present; includes Active Dimensions and Suppressed Dimensions)
2. **Table 1** — Inertia Risk (7-column schema with Decision Window)
3. **Table 2** — Dimensional Risk Register (Phase 1b seeds + Phase 2 additions, HIGH rows first, all columns vocabulary-constrained)
4. **Table 3** — Risk Interdependencies (Trigger Condition + From-Severity + To-Severity columns)
5. **Type distribution** record from Phase 2b
