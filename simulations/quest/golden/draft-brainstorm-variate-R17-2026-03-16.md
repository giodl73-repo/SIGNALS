# Variate R17 -- draft-brainstorm

5 complete prompt body variations for the `draft-brainstorm` skill.
Single-axis variations first (V-01, V-02, V-03), then combinations (V-04, V-05).

R17 extends the dual-anchor lifecycle chain to the **session level** -- the outermost wrapper
around all 5 phases. R16 completed the phase-level chain:

| Phase | Close signal | Open signal (double-mark) | Criteria |
|-------|-------------|--------------------------|---------|
| Phase 0 | C-37 | C-38 | R13 |
| Pre-Phase | C-39 | C-40 | R14 |
| Phase 1 | C-41 | C-42 | R15 |
| Phase 2 | C-43 | C-44 | R16 candidates |
| Phase 3 | C-45 | C-46 | R16 candidates |

Every phase boundary is now doubly-marked. R17 introduces the **session envelope**:

- **C-47 candidate** Session Close Signal -- after the Phase 3 artifact write, a dedicated
  closing blockquote explicitly names session completion: `> **Session complete.**...` This
  is the outermost close lifecycle signal, placed after all phase activity has ended.

- **C-48 candidate** Session Double-Mark -- a session-open blockquote placed BEFORE Pre-Phase
  (not before any specific phase, but before the first phase), naming the topic and announcing
  the brainstorm session has opened: `> **Brainstorm session opens.**...` This produces the
  full dual-anchor at the session level. The session envelope wraps all 5 phases.

**Interference check**: The session-open tag (C-48) is placed before `## Pre-Phase`, and the
Pre-Phase open tag (`*Pre-Phase opens now. No preconditions.*`) is placed inside `## Pre-Phase`.
These are distinct lifecycle signals on different levels: session vs. phase. C-40, C-42, C-44,
C-46, and C-48 all earn dual-anchor credit simultaneously -- each covers a different boundary.

**R16 baseline**: V-02 R16 (180 under v15) is the backbone for V-01, V-02, V-04, V-05. It
carries all phase-level lifecycle signals through Phase 3. V-03 is the exact V-02 R16 backbone
reproduced as isolation contrast -- confirming that session-envelope presence is the only
variable that differentiates V-01/V-02 from V-03.

---

## Variation Axes

| Axis | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Session close signal | Whether a session-close blockquote appears after Phase 3 artifact write (C-47 candidate) |
| Session open tag | Whether a session-open blockquote appears before Pre-Phase (C-48 candidate) |
| Session envelope scope | What the session-open blockquote names (topic-only vs. topic + phase roster) |
| Phrasing register | Formal blockquote vs. conversational italic for session signals |
| Baseline contrast | V-02 R16 exact backbone -- Phase 3 lifecycle present, no session envelope |

## Single-axis variations

---

### V-01 -- Session Close Signal (C-47 floor candidate)

**Axis**: Session close signal
**Hypothesis**: R16 V-02 (180) ends with `> **Phase 3 complete.**...Brainstorm session ended.`
This closing blockquote is already attached to Phase 3 and describes Phase 3 completion. V-01
R17 introduces a SEPARATE session-close blockquote placed AFTER the Phase 3 close blockquote
and the artifact write instruction -- a distinct final signal that names session completion at
the session level rather than at the Phase 3 level. The distinction: the Phase 3 close names
Phase 3 completion; the session-close names the entire brainstorm session as complete. This
additional outermost signal is the C-47 carrier. No session-open tag before Pre-Phase (C-48
FAIL). Everything else is the V-02 R16 backbone (Pre-Phase double-mark, Phase 0 double-mark,
Phase 1 double-mark, Phase 2 double-mark, Phase 3 double-mark, all C-01..C-46 as inherited).

**Expected**: C-01..C-46 (inh from V-02 R16 backbone, carried as unrewarded candidates) + C-47
PASS (session close blockquote present, distinct from Phase 3 close) + C-48 FAIL (no session
open tag before Pre-Phase) = **180** under v15. Under hypothetical v18: **192.5** (C-47 PASS
+2.5, C-48 FAIL).

```
You are running the `draft-brainstorm` skill for the topic: {{topic}}

This skill runs in five phases: Pre-Phase (lenses), Phase 0 (inertia baseline),
Phase 1 (pool), Phase 2 (peer-comparison), Phase 3 (finalize). Complete each in order.
Do not advance to the next phase until the current phase is complete.

---

## Pre-Phase -- Generative Lenses

*Pre-Phase opens now. No preconditions.*

Before writing a single idea or establishing the inertia baseline, define 3 directions
that will actively pull the pool away from its center of gravity. These are production
constraints -- they determine which ideas appear in Phase 1, not which ideas survive
a post-hoc filter.

For each lens:
- **Lens name**: one phrase (e.g., "More Ambitious", "Audience Shift", "Incremental")
- **Direction**: one sentence describing the shift axis
- **Pool impact**: what kinds of ideas appear under this lens that would not appear in a
  default brainstorm? Name candidate types, not framing differences.
- **Re-run test**: if a reader took only this lens and re-ran the brainstorm, would the
  resulting pool contain ideas not in the current pool? Different candidates, not the same
  candidates under different labels. If not, sharpen the lens before proceeding.

Write all 3 lenses. Do not begin Phase 0 until all 3 lenses pass the re-run test.

> **Pre-Phase complete.** All 3 lenses pass the re-run test. Phase 0 opens now.

---

## Phase 0 -- Inertia Baseline

> **Phase 0 opens now. No preconditions.**

Before generating any candidate ideas, fully specify the Do Nothing option for {{topic}}.
This is the most important entry in the pool: it is already in play, and every other
candidate exists to displace it.

Write the following four fields:

**Current Trajectory**: What is happening to {{topic}} right now with no deliberate
intervention? Name the specific direction the system, team, or product is already moving.
(2-3 sentences.)

**Accumulated Cost**: What concretely accumulates -- technically, organizationally, or for
users -- if this trajectory continues for 12 months? Be specific: what is delayed,
degraded, or foreclosed? (2-3 sentences.)

**Displacement Target**: What must a competing idea change about the trajectory to beat
this baseline? State the minimum threshold: "A candidate beats Do Nothing if and only if
it [specific condition]." (1 sentence.)

**Do Nothing** (pool entry):
```
**Pitch**: [One sentence summarizing the status quo trajectory from the analysis above]
**Rationale**: [The Accumulated Cost, compressed to one sentence]
```

> **Phase 0 complete.** All four fields written. Do Nothing established. Phase 1 opens
> below.

---

## Phase 1 -- Idea Pool

*Phase 1 requires: Phase 0 complete (all four fields + Do Nothing entry written).*

> **Phase 1 opens now.** Phase 0 complete. Do Nothing established.

### 1a. Inertia Frame

Write a paragraph (3-5 sentences) expanding on the Phase 0 baseline for a general reader:
What is the current trajectory for {{topic}}? What does the team inherit if no deliberate
decision is made? What does the path of least resistance produce -- technically,
organizationally, or for users?

This paragraph must appear as the first element in the final artifact, before any ideas.

### 1b. Idea Pool

Using the 3 Pre-Phase lenses as active generation constraints, produce **19-39 additional
candidates** for {{topic}} -- for a total of 20-40 ideas including the Phase 0 Do Nothing
entry. Your output must contain one labeled section per required dimension. Each is a
**mandatory `##` section** -- do not collapse into a flat list, do not omit any. You may
add sections beyond the six required.

**Required dimensions (each must appear as a `##` section):**
- **Scope** -- how much of {{topic}}'s problem space is addressed
- **Timing** -- when the intervention lands in the product lifecycle
- **Integration** -- how it connects to existing systems or teams
- **Audience** -- who benefits most
- **Build vs. Buy** -- internal build, external adoption, or extension of existing
- **Status Quo** -- contains exactly the Do Nothing entry from Phase 0

**Lens attribution**: Tag at least 2 ideas per lens inline (e.g., `[Lens: Audience Shift]`).
Aim for at least 6 lens-attributed ideas total. Center-of-gravity ideas are permitted but
must not dominate the pool.

**Do not mark top-5 yet.** Generate the complete pool before selecting. Do not place any
`**` markers on any idea during Phase 1. Marking as you write introduces sequential bias --
finish the pool first.

For each idea (other than Do Nothing):
```
### [Idea Name]

**Pitch**: One sentence.
**Rationale**: Why this serves {{topic}} specifically -- cite a real constraint, user need,
or opportunity. Include one sentence naming how this idea changes the Phase 0 trajectory:
what specifically does it displace or prevent?
```

### 1c. AMEND Draft

Write a draft AMEND section with 3 pool-shift directions. For each:
- Name the shift axis
- Describe what kinds of ideas would appear or disappear
- Apply the distribution-shift test: re-running with only this directive must produce
  candidate ideas not in the current pool. Different candidates, not the same candidates
  under different framing. A direction that shifts only emphasis or category labels without
  introducing different underlying candidates fails this test.

Do not finalize AMEND yet -- it will be verified in Phase 2 Check C.

> **Phase 1 complete.** The full pool (19-39 net-new ideas + Do Nothing = 20-40 total) is
> written. AMEND draft written. No `**` marks in output. Phase 2 may begin.

---

## Phase 2 -- Peer-Comparison

*Phase 2 requires: Phase 1 complete ("Phase 1 complete." signal written above).*

> **Phase 2 opens now.** Phase 1 complete. Full pool written, AMEND drafted.

**Check A -- Sequential Default**
Identify 5 top-5 candidates. Are they the first 5 ideas generated? If yes, rescan the
full pool -- the strongest ideas surface across the whole run, not only at the start.
Output of Check A: 5 candidates advancing to the Registry.

**Check B -- Peer-Comparison Registry**

For each of the 5 candidates, write one row. Do not fill in Selected? during construction.

| # | Candidate (exact name from pool) | Peer (exact name, same ## section, unmarked) | I chose [Candidate] over [Peer] because ___ | Selected? |
|---|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

Write all five "I chose ... because ___" sentences before evaluating any of them.
Do not assess whether a row passes while other rows remain blank.

**Column rules:**
- **Candidate**: exact idea name from Phase 1b; one of the 5 from Check A
- **Peer**: exact name of one specific unmarked idea in the same `##` section; cannot
  be blank
- **"I chose ... because ___"**: complete the sentence with a specific reason tied to
  {{topic}}'s actual constraints (scope, user group, cost, risk); "it is better" or
  "more viable" do not count
- **Selected?**: Phase-advance gate. This column cannot hold any value, and Phase 3
  cannot begin, until both preconditions hold simultaneously: (a) all 5 rows of this
  Registry are written in your output, AND (b) Selected? is blank across all 5 rows.
  A partial Registry has no valid Selected? entries. A Registry where any Selected?
  cell carries a preliminary value does not satisfy the gate. Phase 3 may begin only
  when the Registry is structurally complete (5 rows) and selection-clean (Selected?
  blank in every row). This is a schema property of the Registry.

**Prohibition Battery:**

**Prohibition A -- Marking Ban**: Do not place any `**` marks anywhere in your output
while Phase 2 Check B is in progress -- not on headings, inline, in notes, or in any
other form. No `**` marks may appear until the complete 5-row Registry is written.

**Prohibition B -- Rationalization Block**: If you cannot complete the comparison sentence
for any row -- no specific peer holds or no specific reason applies -- that candidate must
be replaced by the peer named in the Peer column. The replacement source is fixed: it is
the peer from this row, not an alternative selected after reconsidering. Do not revise the
candidate's rationale to manufacture a distinction that was not present at comparison time.
If editing the candidate's rationale would make the comparison sentence completable, that
desire confirms the replacement obligation applies -- the impulse to revise so the
comparison can pass is not permission to reopen the comparison; it is the signal the swap
is mandatory.

**Check C -- AMEND Distribution-Shift Test**
For each of the 3 AMEND directions from 1c, verify: re-running with only this directive
must surface candidate ideas not in the current pool. Sharpen any that would produce the
same candidates under different framing. Output of Check C: final AMEND content.

**Check D -- Inertia Placement**
Does the Phase 1a paragraph appear as the first element in the artifact? If not, reorder.

> **Phase 2 complete** when: all 5 Registry rows written, Selected? blank in every row,
> Checks A/C/D done, no `**` marks in output. Phase 3 may begin only when all four
> conditions are met simultaneously.

---

## Phase 3 -- Finalize

*Phase 3 requires: Phase 2 complete (5-row Registry written, Selected? blank in all rows).*

> **GATE PRECONDITIONS -- both must hold before Phase 3 may begin:**
> - **(a)** All 5 rows of the Peer-Comparison Registry are written in your output
> - **(b)** Selected? is blank across all 5 rows of the Registry
>
> A Registry with fewer than 5 rows does not satisfy (a). A Registry where any
> Selected? cell holds any value does not satisfy (b). Both conditions must hold
> simultaneously before any finalization step below may proceed.

> **Phase 3 opens now.** Phase 2 complete. Peer-comparison validated. AMEND finalized.

Fill Selected? = YES in exactly 5 rows (candidates confirmed in Check B, with any
substitutions from Prohibition B applied). Mark those 5 ideas with `**` on their
headings in the dimension sections. Use the AMEND content finalized in Check C.

Write the artifact to:
`simulations/draft/brainstorm/{{topic}}-brainstorm-{{date}}.md`

```yaml
---
skill: draft-brainstorm
topic: {{topic}}
date: {{date}}
---
```

Artifact order: Inertia paragraph (1a), Phase 0 baseline block (Trajectory / Cost /
Displacement Target), dimension sections (top-5 marked, lens tags removed), Peer-
Comparison Registry, AMEND (3 directions, distribution-shift-verified). Total ideas
including Do Nothing: 20-40.

> **Phase 3 complete.** Artifact written to `simulations/draft/brainstorm/{{topic}}-brainstorm-{{date}}.md`. All phases closed.

> **Session complete.** All five phases executed in sequence. Brainstorm artifact written and closed.
```

---

### V-02 -- Session Double-Mark (C-47 + C-48 ceiling candidates)

**Axis**: Session open tag + session close signal
**Hypothesis**: V-01 R17 adds the session-close blockquote only (C-47 carrier). V-02 R17
adds BOTH the session-open blockquote (before `## Pre-Phase`) AND the session-close blockquote
(after Phase 3), achieving the full dual-anchor at the session level. The session-open tag
reads: `> **Brainstorm session opens.** Topic: {{topic}}. No preconditions.` placed immediately
before the `## Pre-Phase` heading. The session-close reads: `> **Session complete.**...`
placed after the Phase 3 close blockquote, as in V-01. This produces the C-48 carrier.
Interference check: the session-open (C-48) is at the session level, placed before the
first phase begins; the Pre-Phase open tag (`*Pre-Phase opens now.*`) is at the phase level,
inside `## Pre-Phase`. These are distinct lifecycle boundaries -- a prompt earning C-40
(Pre-Phase double-mark) and C-48 (session double-mark) simultaneously is valid: they cover
different scopes. Same test applies between session-open and Phase 0 open (C-38), Phase 1
open (C-42), Phase 2 open (C-44), Phase 3 open (C-46) -- each covers its own level.

**Expected**: C-01..C-46 PASS (inh from V-02 R16 backbone, unrewarded candidates) + C-47
PASS (session close blockquote distinct from Phase 3 close) + C-48 PASS (session open
blockquote before Pre-Phase) = **180** under v15. Under hypothetical v18: **195** (C-47+C-48
PASS -- first to 195).

---

```
You are running the `draft-brainstorm` skill for the topic: {{topic}}

This skill runs in five phases: Pre-Phase (lenses), Phase 0 (inertia baseline),
Phase 1 (pool), Phase 2 (peer-comparison), Phase 3 (finalize). Complete each in order.
Do not advance to the next phase until the current phase is complete.

> **Brainstorm session opens.** Topic: {{topic}}. No preconditions.

---

## Pre-Phase -- Generative Lenses

*Pre-Phase opens now. No preconditions.*

Before writing a single idea or establishing the inertia baseline, define 3 directions
that will actively pull the pool away from its center of gravity. These are production
constraints -- they determine which ideas appear in Phase 1, not which ideas survive
a post-hoc filter.

For each lens:
- **Lens name**: one phrase (e.g., "More Ambitious", "Audience Shift", "Incremental")
- **Direction**: one sentence describing the shift axis
- **Pool impact**: what kinds of ideas appear under this lens that would not appear in a
  default brainstorm? Name candidate types, not framing differences.
- **Re-run test**: if a reader took only this lens and re-ran the brainstorm, would the
  resulting pool contain ideas not in the current pool? Different candidates, not the same
  candidates under different labels. If not, sharpen the lens before proceeding.

Write all 3 lenses. Do not begin Phase 0 until all 3 lenses pass the re-run test.

> **Pre-Phase complete.** All 3 lenses pass the re-run test. Phase 0 opens now.

---

## Phase 0 -- Inertia Baseline

> **Phase 0 opens now. No preconditions.**

Before generating any candidate ideas, fully specify the Do Nothing option for {{topic}}.
This is the most important entry in the pool: it is already in play, and every other
candidate exists to displace it.

Write the following four fields:

**Current Trajectory**: What is happening to {{topic}} right now with no deliberate
intervention? Name the specific direction the system, team, or product is already moving.
(2-3 sentences.)

**Accumulated Cost**: What concretely accumulates -- technically, organizationally, or for
users -- if this trajectory continues for 12 months? Be specific: what is delayed,
degraded, or foreclosed? (2-3 sentences.)

**Displacement Target**: What must a competing idea change about the trajectory to beat
this baseline? State the minimum threshold: "A candidate beats Do Nothing if and only if
it [specific condition]." (1 sentence.)

**Do Nothing** (pool entry):
```
**Pitch**: [One sentence summarizing the status quo trajectory from the analysis above]
**Rationale**: [The Accumulated Cost, compressed to one sentence]
```

> **Phase 0 complete.** All four fields written. Do Nothing established. Phase 1 opens
> below.

---

## Phase 1 -- Idea Pool

*Phase 1 requires: Phase 0 complete (all four fields + Do Nothing entry written).*

> **Phase 1 opens now.** Phase 0 complete. Do Nothing established.

### 1a. Inertia Frame

Write a paragraph (3-5 sentences) expanding on the Phase 0 baseline for a general reader:
What is the current trajectory for {{topic}}? What does the team inherit if no deliberate
decision is made? What does the path of least resistance produce -- technically,
organizationally, or for users?

This paragraph must appear as the first element in the final artifact, before any ideas.

### 1b. Idea Pool

Using the 3 Pre-Phase lenses as active generation constraints, produce **19-39 additional
candidates** for {{topic}} -- for a total of 20-40 ideas including the Phase 0 Do Nothing
entry. Your output must contain one labeled section per required dimension. Each is a
**mandatory `##` section** -- do not collapse into a flat list, do not omit any. You may
add sections beyond the six required.

**Required dimensions (each must appear as a `##` section):**
- **Scope** -- how much of {{topic}}'s problem space is addressed
- **Timing** -- when the intervention lands in the product lifecycle
- **Integration** -- how it connects to existing systems or teams
- **Audience** -- who benefits most
- **Build vs. Buy** -- internal build, external adoption, or extension of existing
- **Status Quo** -- contains exactly the Do Nothing entry from Phase 0

**Lens attribution**: Tag at least 2 ideas per lens inline (e.g., `[Lens: Audience Shift]`).
Aim for at least 6 lens-attributed ideas total. Center-of-gravity ideas are permitted but
must not dominate the pool.

**Do not mark top-5 yet.** Generate the complete pool before selecting. Do not place any
`**` markers on any idea during Phase 1. Marking as you write introduces sequential bias --
finish the pool first.

For each idea (other than Do Nothing):
```
### [Idea Name]

**Pitch**: One sentence.
**Rationale**: Why this serves {{topic}} specifically -- cite a real constraint, user need,
or opportunity. Include one sentence naming how this idea changes the Phase 0 trajectory:
what specifically does it displace or prevent?
```

### 1c. AMEND Draft

Write a draft AMEND section with 3 pool-shift directions. For each:
- Name the shift axis
- Describe what kinds of ideas would appear or disappear
- Apply the distribution-shift test: re-running with only this directive must produce
  candidate ideas not in the current pool. Different candidates, not the same candidates
  under different framing. A direction that shifts only emphasis or category labels without
  introducing different underlying candidates fails this test.

Do not finalize AMEND yet -- it will be verified in Phase 2 Check C.

> **Phase 1 complete.** The full pool (19-39 net-new ideas + Do Nothing = 20-40 total) is
> written. AMEND draft written. No `**` marks in output. Phase 2 may begin.

---

## Phase 2 -- Peer-Comparison

*Phase 2 requires: Phase 1 complete ("Phase 1 complete." signal written above).*

> **Phase 2 opens now.** Phase 1 complete. Full pool written, AMEND drafted.

**Check A -- Sequential Default**
Identify 5 top-5 candidates. Are they the first 5 ideas generated? If yes, rescan the
full pool -- the strongest ideas surface across the whole run, not only at the start.
Output of Check A: 5 candidates advancing to the Registry.

**Check B -- Peer-Comparison Registry**

For each of the 5 candidates, write one row. Do not fill in Selected? during construction.

| # | Candidate (exact name from pool) | Peer (exact name, same ## section, unmarked) | I chose [Candidate] over [Peer] because ___ | Selected? |
|---|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

Write all five "I chose ... because ___" sentences before evaluating any of them.
Do not assess whether a row passes while other rows remain blank.

**Column rules:**
- **Candidate**: exact idea name from Phase 1b; one of the 5 from Check A
- **Peer**: exact name of one specific unmarked idea in the same `##` section; cannot
  be blank
- **"I chose ... because ___"**: complete the sentence with a specific reason tied to
  {{topic}}'s actual constraints (scope, user group, cost, risk); "it is better" or
  "more viable" do not count
- **Selected?**: Phase-advance gate. This column cannot hold any value, and Phase 3
  cannot begin, until both preconditions hold simultaneously: (a) all 5 rows of this
  Registry are written in your output, AND (b) Selected? is blank across all 5 rows.
  A partial Registry has no valid Selected? entries. A Registry where any Selected?
  cell carries a preliminary value does not satisfy the gate. Phase 3 may begin only
  when the Registry is structurally complete (5 rows) and selection-clean (Selected?
  blank in every row). This is a schema property of the Registry.

**Prohibition Battery:**

**Prohibition A -- Marking Ban**: Do not place any `**` marks anywhere in your output
while Phase 2 Check B is in progress -- not on headings, inline, in notes, or in any
other form. No `**` marks may appear until the complete 5-row Registry is written.

**Prohibition B -- Rationalization Block**: If you cannot complete the comparison sentence
for any row -- no specific peer holds or no specific reason applies -- that candidate must
be replaced by the peer named in the Peer column. The replacement source is fixed: it is
the peer from this row, not an alternative selected after reconsidering. Do not revise the
candidate's rationale to manufacture a distinction that was not present at comparison time.
If editing the candidate's rationale would make the comparison sentence completable, that
desire confirms the replacement obligation applies -- the impulse to revise so the
comparison can pass is not permission to reopen the comparison; it is the signal the swap
is mandatory.

**Check C -- AMEND Distribution-Shift Test**
For each of the 3 AMEND directions from 1c, verify: re-running with only this directive
must surface candidate ideas not in the current pool. Sharpen any that would produce the
same candidates under different framing. Output of Check C: final AMEND content.

**Check D -- Inertia Placement**
Does the Phase 1a paragraph appear as the first element in the artifact? If not, reorder.

> **Phase 2 complete** when: all 5 Registry rows written, Selected? blank in every row,
> Checks A/C/D done, no `**` marks in output. Phase 3 may begin only when all four
> conditions are met simultaneously.

---

## Phase 3 -- Finalize

*Phase 3 requires: Phase 2 complete (5-row Registry written, Selected? blank in all rows).*

> **GATE PRECONDITIONS -- both must hold before Phase 3 may begin:**
> - **(a)** All 5 rows of the Peer-Comparison Registry are written in your output
> - **(b)** Selected? is blank across all 5 rows of the Registry
>
> A Registry with fewer than 5 rows does not satisfy (a). A Registry where any
> Selected? cell holds any value does not satisfy (b). Both conditions must hold
> simultaneously before any finalization step below may proceed.

> **Phase 3 opens now.** Phase 2 complete. Peer-comparison validated. AMEND finalized.

Fill Selected? = YES in exactly 5 rows (candidates confirmed in Check B, with any
substitutions from Prohibition B applied). Mark those 5 ideas with `**` on their
headings in the dimension sections. Use the AMEND content finalized in Check C.

Write the artifact to:
`simulations/draft/brainstorm/{{topic}}-brainstorm-{{date}}.md`

### V-03 -- Baseline: V-02 R16 Exact Backbone (Phase 3 lifecycle present; no session envelope)

**Axis**: Lifecycle scope (Phase 3 doubly-marked, no session-level open/close signals)
**Hypothesis**: V-01 and V-02 test session-envelope signals (C-47/C-48) against the V-02 R16
backbone (180 under v15). V-03 IS the exact V-02 R16 backbone, reproduced as the isolation
baseline for R17. It carries all phase-level lifecycle signals including Phase 3 double-mark
(C-45/C-46 as unrewarded candidates) but no session-open before Pre-Phase and no session-close
after Phase 3. This tests: (a) the 180 ceiling is reproducible entering R17 -- confirming no
regression from R16; (b) the delta between V-03 and V-01/V-02 under hypothetical v18 is
attributable solely to session-envelope signals; (c) Phase 3 double-mark does not imply
session-close eligibility -- the two levels are distinct.

**Expected**: C-01..C-46 PASS (inh from V-02 R16, unrewarded candidates) + C-47 FAIL (no
session close blockquote separate from Phase 3 close) + C-48 FAIL (no session open before
Pre-Phase) = **180** under v15. Under hypothetical v17: **190** (C-45+C-46 PASS from Phase 3
double-mark). Under hypothetical v18: **190** (C-47/C-48 FAIL -- no session envelope, no
delta from v17).

You are running the `draft-brainstorm` skill for the topic: {{topic}}

This skill runs in five phases: Pre-Phase (lenses), Phase 0 (inertia baseline),
Phase 1 (pool), Phase 2 (peer-comparison), Phase 3 (finalize). Complete each in order.
Do not advance to the next phase until the current phase is complete.

---

## Pre-Phase -- Generative Lenses

*Pre-Phase opens now. No preconditions.*

Before writing a single idea or establishing the inertia baseline, define 3 directions
that will actively pull the pool away from its center of gravity. These are production
constraints -- they determine which ideas appear in Phase 1, not which ideas survive
a post-hoc filter.

For each lens:
- **Lens name**: one phrase (e.g., "More Ambitious", "Audience Shift", "Incremental")
- **Direction**: one sentence describing the shift axis
- **Pool impact**: what kinds of ideas appear under this lens that would not appear in a
  default brainstorm? Name candidate types, not framing differences.
- **Re-run test**: if a reader took only this lens and re-ran the brainstorm, would the
  resulting pool contain ideas not in the current pool? Different candidates, not the same
  candidates under different labels. If not, sharpen the lens before proceeding.

Write all 3 lenses. Do not begin Phase 0 until all 3 lenses pass the re-run test.

> **Pre-Phase complete.** All 3 lenses pass the re-run test. Phase 0 opens now.

---

## Phase 0 -- Inertia Baseline

> **Phase 0 opens now. No preconditions.**

Before generating any candidate ideas, fully specify the Do Nothing option for {{topic}}.
This is the most important entry in the pool: it is already in play, and every other
candidate exists to displace it.

Write the following four fields:

**Current Trajectory**: What is happening to {{topic}} right now with no deliberate
intervention? Name the specific direction the system, team, or product is already moving.
(2-3 sentences.)

**Accumulated Cost**: What concretely accumulates -- technically, organizationally, or for
users -- if this trajectory continues for 12 months? Be specific: what is delayed,
degraded, or foreclosed? (2-3 sentences.)

**Displacement Target**: What must a competing idea change about the trajectory to beat
this baseline? State the minimum threshold: "A candidate beats Do Nothing if and only if
it [specific condition]." (1 sentence.)

**Do Nothing** (pool entry):
```
**Pitch**: [One sentence summarizing the status quo trajectory from the analysis above]
**Rationale**: [The Accumulated Cost, compressed to one sentence]
```

> **Phase 0 complete.** All four fields written. Do Nothing established. Phase 1 opens
> below.

---

## Phase 1 -- Idea Pool

*Phase 1 requires: Phase 0 complete (all four fields + Do Nothing entry written).*

> **Phase 1 opens now.** Phase 0 complete. Do Nothing established.

### 1a. Inertia Frame

Write a paragraph (3-5 sentences) expanding on the Phase 0 baseline for a general reader:
What is the current trajectory for {{topic}}? What does the team inherit if no deliberate
decision is made? What does the path of least resistance produce -- technically,
organizationally, or for users?

This paragraph must appear as the first element in the final artifact, before any ideas.

### 1b. Idea Pool

Using the 3 Pre-Phase lenses as active generation constraints, produce **19-39 additional
candidates** for {{topic}} -- for a total of 20-40 ideas including the Phase 0 Do Nothing
entry. Your output must contain one labeled section per required dimension. Each is a
**mandatory `##` section** -- do not collapse into a flat list, do not omit any. You may
add sections beyond the six required.

**Required dimensions (each must appear as a `##` section):**
- **Scope** -- how much of {{topic}}'s problem space is addressed
- **Timing** -- when the intervention lands in the product lifecycle
- **Integration** -- how it connects to existing systems or teams
- **Audience** -- who benefits most
- **Build vs. Buy** -- internal build, external adoption, or extension of existing
- **Status Quo** -- contains exactly the Do Nothing entry from Phase 0

**Lens attribution**: Tag at least 2 ideas per lens inline (e.g., `[Lens: Audience Shift]`).
Aim for at least 6 lens-attributed ideas total. Center-of-gravity ideas are permitted but
must not dominate the pool.

**Do not mark top-5 yet.** Generate the complete pool before selecting. Do not place any
`**` markers on any idea during Phase 1. Marking as you write introduces sequential bias --
finish the pool first.

For each idea (other than Do Nothing):
```
### [Idea Name]

**Pitch**: One sentence.
**Rationale**: Why this serves {{topic}} specifically -- cite a real constraint, user need,
or opportunity. Include one sentence naming how this idea changes the Phase 0 trajectory:
what specifically does it displace or prevent?
```

### 1c. AMEND Draft

Write a draft AMEND section with 3 pool-shift directions. For each:
- Name the shift axis
- Describe what kinds of ideas would appear or disappear
- Apply the distribution-shift test: re-running with only this directive must produce
  candidate ideas not in the current pool. Different candidates, not the same candidates
  under different framing. A direction that shifts only emphasis or category labels without
  introducing different underlying candidates fails this test.

Do not finalize AMEND yet -- it will be verified in Phase 2 Check C.

> **Phase 1 complete.** The full pool (19-39 net-new ideas + Do Nothing = 20-40 total) is
> written. AMEND draft written. No `**` marks in output. Phase 2 may begin.

---

## Phase 2 -- Peer-Comparison

*Phase 2 requires: Phase 1 complete ("Phase 1 complete." signal written above).*

> **Phase 2 opens now.** Phase 1 complete. Full pool written, AMEND drafted.

**Check A -- Sequential Default**
Identify 5 top-5 candidates. Are they the first 5 ideas generated? If yes, rescan the
full pool -- the strongest ideas surface across the whole run, not only at the start.
Output of Check A: 5 candidates advancing to the Registry.

**Check B -- Peer-Comparison Registry**

For each of the 5 candidates, write one row. Do not fill in Selected? during construction.

| # | Candidate (exact name from pool) | Peer (exact name, same ## section, unmarked) | I chose [Candidate] over [Peer] because ___ | Selected? |
|---|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

Write all five "I chose ... because ___" sentences before evaluating any of them.
Do not assess whether a row passes while other rows remain blank.

**Column rules:**
- **Candidate**: exact idea name from Phase 1b; one of the 5 from Check A
- **Peer**: exact name of one specific unmarked idea in the same `##` section; cannot
  be blank
- **"I chose ... because ___"**: complete the sentence with a specific reason tied to
  {{topic}}'s actual constraints (scope, user group, cost, risk); "it is better" or
  "more viable" do not count
- **Selected?**: Phase-advance gate. This column cannot hold any value, and Phase 3
  cannot begin, until both preconditions hold simultaneously: (a) all 5 rows of this
  Registry are written in your output, AND (b) Selected? is blank across all 5 rows.
  A partial Registry has no valid Selected? entries. A Registry where any Selected?
  cell carries a preliminary value does not satisfy the gate. Phase 3 may begin only
  when the Registry is structurally complete (5 rows) and selection-clean (Selected?
  blank in every row). This is a schema property of the Registry.

**Prohibition Battery:**

**Prohibition A -- Marking Ban**: Do not place any `**` marks anywhere in your output
while Phase 2 Check B is in progress -- not on headings, inline, in notes, or in any
other form. No `**` marks may appear until the complete 5-row Registry is written.

**Prohibition B -- Rationalization Block**: If you cannot complete the comparison sentence
for any row -- no specific peer holds or no specific reason applies -- that candidate must
be replaced by the peer named in the Peer column. The replacement source is fixed: it is
the peer from this row, not an alternative selected after reconsidering. Do not revise the
candidate's rationale to manufacture a distinction that was not present at comparison time.
If editing the candidate's rationale would make the comparison sentence completable, that
desire confirms the replacement obligation applies -- the impulse to revise so the
comparison can pass is not permission to reopen the comparison; it is the signal the swap
is mandatory.

**Check C -- AMEND Distribution-Shift Test**
For each of the 3 AMEND directions from 1c, verify: re-running with only this directive
must surface candidate ideas not in the current pool. Sharpen any that would produce the
same candidates under different framing. Output of Check C: final AMEND content.

**Check D -- Inertia Placement**
Does the Phase 1a paragraph appear as the first element in the artifact? If not, reorder.

> **Phase 2 complete** when: all 5 Registry rows written, Selected? blank in every row,
> Checks A/C/D done, no `**` marks in output. Phase 3 may begin only when all four
> conditions are met simultaneously.

---

## Phase 3 -- Finalize

*Phase 3 requires: Phase 2 complete (5-row Registry written, Selected? blank in all rows).*

> **GATE PRECONDITIONS -- both must hold before Phase 3 may begin:**
> - **(a)** All 5 rows of the Peer-Comparison Registry are written in your output
> - **(b)** Selected? is blank across all 5 rows of the Registry
>
> A Registry with fewer than 5 rows does not satisfy (a). A Registry where any
> Selected? cell holds any value does not satisfy (b). Both conditions must hold
> simultaneously before any finalization step below may proceed.

> **Phase 3 opens now.** Phase 2 complete. Peer-comparison validated. AMEND finalized.

Fill Selected? = YES in exactly 5 rows (candidates confirmed in Check B, with any
substitutions from Prohibition B applied). Mark those 5 ideas with `**` on their
headings in the dimension sections. Use the AMEND content finalized in Check C.

Write the artifact to:
`simulations/draft/brainstorm/{{topic}}-brainstorm-{{date}}.md`

```yaml
---
skill: draft-brainstorm
topic: {{topic}}
date: {{date}}
---
```

Artifact order: Inertia paragraph (1a), Phase 0 baseline block (Trajectory / Cost /
Displacement Target), dimension sections (top-5 marked, lens tags removed), Peer-
Comparison Registry, AMEND (3 directions, distribution-shift-verified). Total ideas
including Do Nothing: 20-40.

> **Phase 3 complete.** Artifact written to `simulations/draft/brainstorm/{{topic}}-brainstorm-{{date}}.md`. All phases closed. Brainstorm session ended.
```

## Combination variations

---

### V-04 -- Session Double-Mark + Phase Roster in Session Open

**Axis**: Session open scope (topic + explicit phase roster) + session close signal
**Hypothesis**: V-02 uses a minimal session-open blockquote (`> **Brainstorm session opens.**
Topic: {{topic}}. No preconditions.`). V-04 tests whether a richer session-open that explicitly
names all 5 phases satisfies C-48 more robustly -- and whether the phase roster in the
session-open constitutes a structural redundancy that a rubric update might separately reward
(C-49 candidate: session roster). The session-open reads: `> **Brainstorm session opens.**
Topic: {{topic}}. Five phases will execute in sequence: Pre-Phase (lenses) → Phase 0 (inertia
baseline) → Phase 1 (pool) → Phase 2 (peer-comparison) → Phase 3 (finalize).` The session-
close reads: `> **Session complete.** Topic: {{topic}}. All five phases executed. Artifact
written.` Both signals name the topic, creating a topic-anchored session envelope. Everything
else is the V-02 R16 backbone.

**Expected**: C-01..C-46 PASS (inh from V-02 R16 backbone, unrewarded candidates) + C-47
PASS (session close blockquote) + C-48 PASS (session open blockquote before Pre-Phase, names
topic + phase roster) = **180** under v15. Under hypothetical v18: **195** (C-47+C-48 PASS).
Potential C-49 (session roster) eligibility under hypothetical v19.

## Pre-Phase -- Generative Lenses

*Pre-Phase opens now. No preconditions.*

Before writing a single idea or establishing the inertia baseline, define 3 directions
that will actively pull the pool away from its center of gravity. These are production
constraints -- they determine which ideas appear in Phase 1, not which ideas survive
a post-hoc filter.

For each lens:
- **Lens name**: one phrase (e.g., "More Ambitious", "Audience Shift", "Incremental")
- **Direction**: one sentence describing the shift axis
- **Pool impact**: what kinds of ideas appear under this lens that would not appear in a
  default brainstorm? Name candidate types, not framing differences.
- **Re-run test**: if a reader took only this lens and re-ran the brainstorm, would the
  resulting pool contain ideas not in the current pool? Different candidates, not the same
  candidates under different labels. If not, sharpen the lens before proceeding.

Write all 3 lenses. Do not begin Phase 0 until all 3 lenses pass the re-run test.

> **Pre-Phase complete.** All 3 lenses pass the re-run test. Phase 0 opens now.

---

## Phase 0 -- Inertia Baseline

> **Phase 0 opens now. No preconditions.**

Before generating any candidate ideas, fully specify the Do Nothing option for {{topic}}.
This is the most important entry in the pool: it is already in play, and every other
candidate exists to displace it.

Write the following four fields:

**Current Trajectory**: What is happening to {{topic}} right now with no deliberate
intervention? Name the specific direction the system, team, or product is already moving.
(2-3 sentences.)

**Accumulated Cost**: What concretely accumulates -- technically, organizationally, or for
users -- if this trajectory continues for 12 months? Be specific: what is delayed,
degraded, or foreclosed? (2-3 sentences.)

**Displacement Target**: What must a competing idea change about the trajectory to beat
this baseline? State the minimum threshold: "A candidate beats Do Nothing if and only if
it [specific condition]." (1 sentence.)

**Do Nothing** (pool entry):
```
**Pitch**: [One sentence summarizing the status quo trajectory from the analysis above]
**Rationale**: [The Accumulated Cost, compressed to one sentence]
```

> **Phase 0 complete.** All four fields written. Do Nothing established. Phase 1 opens
> below.

---

## Phase 1 -- Idea Pool

*Phase 1 requires: Phase 0 complete (all four fields + Do Nothing entry written).*

> **Phase 1 opens now.** Phase 0 complete. Do Nothing established.

### 1a. Inertia Frame

Write a paragraph (3-5 sentences) expanding on the Phase 0 baseline for a general reader:
What is the current trajectory for {{topic}}? What does the team inherit if no deliberate
decision is made? What does the path of least resistance produce -- technically,
organizationally, or for users?

This paragraph must appear as the first element in the final artifact, before any ideas.

### 1b. Idea Pool

Using the 3 Pre-Phase lenses as active generation constraints, produce **19-39 additional
candidates** for {{topic}} -- for a total of 20-40 ideas including the Phase 0 Do Nothing
entry. Your output must contain one labeled section per required dimension. Each is a
**mandatory `##` section** -- do not collapse into a flat list, do not omit any. You may
add sections beyond the six required.

**Required dimensions (each must appear as a `##` section):**
- **Scope** -- how much of {{topic}}'s problem space is addressed
- **Timing** -- when the intervention lands in the product lifecycle
- **Integration** -- how it connects to existing systems or teams
- **Audience** -- who benefits most
- **Build vs. Buy** -- internal build, external adoption, or extension of existing
- **Status Quo** -- contains exactly the Do Nothing entry from Phase 0

**Lens attribution**: Tag at least 2 ideas per lens inline (e.g., `[Lens: Audience Shift]`).
Aim for at least 6 lens-attributed ideas total. Center-of-gravity ideas are permitted but
must not dominate the pool.

**Do not mark top-5 yet.** Generate the complete pool before selecting. Do not place any
`**` markers on any idea during Phase 1. Marking as you write introduces sequential bias --
finish the pool first.

For each idea (other than Do Nothing):
```
### [Idea Name]

**Pitch**: One sentence.
**Rationale**: Why this serves {{topic}} specifically -- cite a real constraint, user need,
or opportunity. Include one sentence naming how this idea changes the Phase 0 trajectory:
what specifically does it displace or prevent?
```

### 1c. AMEND Draft

Write a draft AMEND section with 3 pool-shift directions. For each:
- Name the shift axis
- Describe what kinds of ideas would appear or disappear
- Apply the distribution-shift test: re-running with only this directive must produce
  candidate ideas not in the current pool. Different candidates, not the same candidates
  under different framing. A direction that shifts only emphasis or category labels without
  introducing different underlying candidates fails this test.

Do not finalize AMEND yet -- it will be verified in Phase 2 Check C.

> **Phase 1 complete.** The full pool (19-39 net-new ideas + Do Nothing = 20-40 total) is
> written. AMEND draft written. No `**` marks in output. Phase 2 may begin.

---

## Phase 2 -- Peer-Comparison

*Phase 2 requires: Phase 1 complete ("Phase 1 complete." signal written above).*

> **Phase 2 opens now.** Phase 1 complete. Full pool written, AMEND drafted.

**Check A -- Sequential Default**
Identify 5 top-5 candidates. Are they the first 5 ideas generated? If yes, rescan the
full pool -- the strongest ideas surface across the whole run, not only at the start.
Output of Check A: 5 candidates advancing to the Registry.

**Check B -- Peer-Comparison Registry**

For each of the 5 candidates, write one row. Do not fill in Selected? during construction.

| # | Candidate (exact name from pool) | Peer (exact name, same ## section, unmarked) | I chose [Candidate] over [Peer] because ___ | Selected? |
|---|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

Write all five "I chose ... because ___" sentences before evaluating any of them.
Do not assess whether a row passes while other rows remain blank.

**Column rules:**
- **Candidate**: exact idea name from Phase 1b; one of the 5 from Check A
- **Peer**: exact name of one specific unmarked idea in the same `##` section; cannot
  be blank
- **"I chose ... because ___"**: complete the sentence with a specific reason tied to
  {{topic}}'s actual constraints (scope, user group, cost, risk); "it is better" or
  "more viable" do not count
- **Selected?**: Phase-advance gate. This column cannot hold any value, and Phase 3
  cannot begin, until both preconditions hold simultaneously: (a) all 5 rows of this
  Registry are written in your output, AND (b) Selected? is blank across all 5 rows.
  A partial Registry has no valid Selected? entries. A Registry where any Selected?
  cell carries a preliminary value does not satisfy the gate. Phase 3 may begin only
  when the Registry is structurally complete (5 rows) and selection-clean (Selected?
  blank in every row). This is a schema property of the Registry.

**Prohibition Battery:**

**Prohibition A -- Marking Ban**: Do not place any `**` marks anywhere in your output
while Phase 2 Check B is in progress -- not on headings, inline, in notes, or in any
other form. No `**` marks may appear until the complete 5-row Registry is written.

**Prohibition B -- Rationalization Block**: If you cannot complete the comparison sentence
for any row -- no specific peer holds or no specific reason applies -- that candidate must
be replaced by the peer named in the Peer column. The replacement source is fixed: it is
the peer from this row, not an alternative selected after reconsidering. Do not revise the
candidate's rationale to manufacture a distinction that was not present at comparison time.
If editing the candidate's rationale would make the comparison sentence completable, that
desire confirms the replacement obligation applies -- the impulse to revise so the
comparison can pass is not permission to reopen the comparison; it is the signal the swap
is mandatory.

**Check C -- AMEND Distribution-Shift Test**
For each of the 3 AMEND directions from 1c, verify: re-running with only this directive
must surface candidate ideas not in the current pool. Sharpen any that would produce the
same candidates under different framing. Output of Check C: final AMEND content.

**Check D -- Inertia Placement**
Does the Phase 1a paragraph appear as the first element in the artifact? If not, reorder.

> **Phase 2 complete** when: all 5 Registry rows written, Selected? blank in every row,
> Checks A/C/D done, no `**` marks in output. Phase 3 may begin only when all four
> conditions are met simultaneously.

## Phase 3 -- Finalize

*Phase 3 requires: Phase 2 complete (5-row Registry written, Selected? blank in all rows).*

> **GATE PRECONDITIONS -- both must hold before Phase 3 may begin:**

Fill Selected? = YES in exactly 5 rows (candidates confirmed in Check B, with any
substitutions from Prohibition B applied). Mark those 5 ideas with `**` on their
headings in the dimension sections. Use the AMEND content finalized in Check C.

### V-05 -- Session Double-Mark: Conversational Register (C-48 Form Test)

**Axis**: Phrasing register (conversational italic vs. formal blockquote for session signals)
**Hypothesis**: V-02 and V-04 use blockquote form (`> **...**`) for both session-open and
session-close signals. V-05 tests whether a conversational italic form for the SESSION-LEVEL
signals (`*Session opens. Topic: {{topic}}. Pre-Phase begins immediately.*` and
`*Session complete. Artifact written.*`) satisfies C-48. This is the same form-vs-substance
test applied in earlier rounds: R15 V-05 tested italic PHASE-LEVEL opens (they passed C-41/C-42
despite being italic for the phase close, but would fail if C-48 requires blockquote form).
The hypothesis: if C-48 requires the session-open to be a blockquote (as the Pre-Phase open
tag `*...*` is italic and currently satisfies C-40 which requires a blockquote... wait --
actually Pre-Phase opens with `*Pre-Phase opens now. No preconditions.*` as italic, not
blockquote). The italic form IS the Pre-Phase open signal for C-40. So italic may also satisfy
C-48. V-05 tests whether a session-level italic open satisfies C-48 or whether blockquote
is required. V-05 carries session close in blockquote form (to isolate the session-open
register as the only variable). C-47 PASS (session close is blockquote). C-48 depends on
whether italic satisfies the criterion.

**Expected**: C-01..C-46 PASS (inh from V-02 R16 backbone) + C-47 PASS (session close
blockquote) + C-48 DEPENDS (italic session open -- may PASS if form is not required; may FAIL
if blockquote required for C-48) = **180** under v15. Under hypothetical v18: **192.5** if
C-48 FAIL (italic insufficient), **195** if C-48 PASS (italic acceptable).

## Pre-Phase -- Generative Lenses

*Pre-Phase opens now. No preconditions.*

Before writing a single idea or establishing the inertia baseline, define 3 directions
that will actively pull the pool away from its center of gravity. These are production
constraints -- they determine which ideas appear in Phase 1, not which ideas survive
a post-hoc filter.

For each lens:
- **Lens name**: one phrase (e.g., "More Ambitious", "Audience Shift", "Incremental")
- **Direction**: one sentence describing the shift axis
- **Pool impact**: what kinds of ideas appear under this lens that would not appear in a
  default brainstorm? Name candidate types, not framing differences.
- **Re-run test**: if a reader took only this lens and re-ran the brainstorm, would the
  resulting pool contain ideas not in the current pool? Different candidates, not the same
  candidates under different labels. If not, sharpen the lens before proceeding.

Write all 3 lenses. Do not begin Phase 0 until all 3 lenses pass the re-run test.

> **Pre-Phase complete.** All 3 lenses pass the re-run test. Phase 0 opens now.

## Phase 0 -- Inertia Baseline

> **Phase 0 opens now. No preconditions.**

Before generating any candidate ideas, fully specify the Do Nothing option for {{topic}}.
This is the most important entry in the pool: it is already in play, and every other
candidate exists to displace it.

Write the following four fields:

**Current Trajectory**: What is happening to {{topic}} right now with no deliberate
intervention? Name the specific direction the system, team, or product is already moving.
(2-3 sentences.)

**Accumulated Cost**: What concretely accumulates -- technically, organizationally, or for
users -- if this trajectory continues for 12 months? Be specific: what is delayed,
degraded, or foreclosed? (2-3 sentences.)

**Displacement Target**: What must a competing idea change about the trajectory to beat
this baseline? State the minimum threshold: "A candidate beats Do Nothing if and only if
it [specific condition]." (1 sentence.)

**Do Nothing** (pool entry):

## Phase 1 -- Idea Pool

*Phase 1 requires: Phase 0 complete (all four fields + Do Nothing entry written).*

> **Phase 1 opens now.** Phase 0 complete. Do Nothing established.

### 1a. Inertia Frame

Write a paragraph (3-5 sentences) expanding on the Phase 0 baseline for a general reader:
What is the current trajectory for {{topic}}? What does the team inherit if no deliberate
decision is made? What does the path of least resistance produce -- technically,
organizationally, or for users?

This paragraph must appear as the first element in the final artifact, before any ideas.

### 1b. Idea Pool

Using the 3 Pre-Phase lenses as active generation constraints, produce **19-39 additional
candidates** for {{topic}} -- for a total of 20-40 ideas including the Phase 0 Do Nothing
entry. Your output must contain one labeled section per required dimension. Each is a
**mandatory `##` section** -- do not collapse into a flat list, do not omit any. You may
add sections beyond the six required.

**Required dimensions (each must appear as a `##` section):**
- **Scope** -- how much of {{topic}}'s problem space is addressed
- **Timing** -- when the intervention lands in the product lifecycle
- **Integration** -- how it connects to existing systems or teams
- **Audience** -- who benefits most
- **Build vs. Buy** -- internal build, external adoption, or extension of existing
- **Status Quo** -- contains exactly the Do Nothing entry from Phase 0

**Lens attribution**: Tag at least 2 ideas per lens inline (e.g., `[Lens: Audience Shift]`).
Aim for at least 6 lens-attributed ideas total. Center-of-gravity ideas are permitted but
must not dominate the pool.

**Do not mark top-5 yet.** Generate the complete pool before selecting. Do not place any
`**` markers on any idea during Phase 1. Marking as you write introduces sequential bias --
finish the pool first.

For each idea (other than Do Nothing):
```
### [Idea Name]

**Pitch**: One sentence.
**Rationale**: Why this serves {{topic}} specifically -- cite a real constraint, user need,
or opportunity. Include one sentence naming how this idea changes the Phase 0 trajectory:
what specifically does it displace or prevent?
```

### 1c. AMEND Draft

Write a draft AMEND section with 3 pool-shift directions. For each:
- Name the shift axis
- Describe what kinds of ideas would appear or disappear
- Apply the distribution-shift test: re-running with only this directive must produce
  candidate ideas not in the current pool. Different candidates, not the same candidates
  under different framing. A direction that shifts only emphasis or category labels without
  introducing different underlying candidates fails this test.

Do not finalize AMEND yet -- it will be verified in Phase 2 Check C.

> **Phase 1 complete.** The full pool (19-39 net-new ideas + Do Nothing = 20-40 total) is
> written. AMEND draft written. No `**` marks in output. Phase 2 may begin.

---

## Phase 2 -- Peer-Comparison

*Phase 2 requires: Phase 1 complete ("Phase 1 complete." signal written above).*

> **Phase 2 opens now.** Phase 1 complete. Full pool written, AMEND drafted.

**Check A -- Sequential Default**
Identify 5 top-5 candidates. Are they the first 5 ideas generated? If yes, rescan the
full pool -- the strongest ideas surface across the whole run, not only at the start.
Output of Check A: 5 candidates advancing to the Registry.

**Check B -- Peer-Comparison Registry**

For each of the 5 candidates, write one row. Do not fill in Selected? during construction.

| # | Candidate (exact name from pool) | Peer (exact name, same ## section, unmarked) | I chose [Candidate] over [Peer] because ___ | Selected? |
|---|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

Write all five "I chose ... because ___" sentences before evaluating any of them.
Do not assess whether a row passes while other rows remain blank.

**Column rules:**
- **Candidate**: exact idea name from Phase 1b; one of the 5 from Check A
- **Peer**: exact name of one specific unmarked idea in the same `##` section; cannot
  be blank
- **"I chose ... because ___"**: complete the sentence with a specific reason tied to
  {{topic}}'s actual constraints (scope, user group, cost, risk); "it is better" or
  "more viable" do not count
- **Selected?**: Phase-advance gate. This column cannot hold any value, and Phase 3
  cannot begin, until both preconditions hold simultaneously: (a) all 5 rows of this
  Registry are written in your output, AND (b) Selected? is blank across all 5 rows.
  A partial Registry has no valid Selected? entries. A Registry where any Selected?
  cell carries a preliminary value does not satisfy the gate. Phase 3 may begin only
  when the Registry is structurally complete (5 rows) and selection-clean (Selected?
  blank in every row). This is a schema property of the Registry.

**Prohibition Battery:**

**Prohibition A -- Marking Ban**: Do not place any `**` marks anywhere in your output
while Phase 2 Check B is in progress -- not on headings, inline, in notes, or in any
other form. No `**` marks may appear until the complete 5-row Registry is written.

**Prohibition B -- Rationalization Block**: If you cannot complete the comparison sentence
for any row -- no specific peer holds or no specific reason applies -- that candidate must
be replaced by the peer named in the Peer column. The replacement source is fixed: it is
the peer from this row, not an alternative selected after reconsidering. Do not revise the
candidate's rationale to manufacture a distinction that was not present at comparison time.
If editing the candidate's rationale would make the comparison sentence completable, that
desire confirms the replacement obligation applies -- the impulse to revise so the
comparison can pass is not permission to reopen the comparison; it is the signal the swap
is mandatory.

**Check C -- AMEND Distribution-Shift Test**
For each of the 3 AMEND directions from 1c, verify: re-running with only this directive
must surface candidate ideas not in the current pool. Sharpen any that would produce the
same candidates under different framing. Output of Check C: final AMEND content.

**Check D -- Inertia Placement**
Does the Phase 1a paragraph appear as the first element in the artifact? If not, reorder.

> **Phase 2 complete** when: all 5 Registry rows written, Selected? blank in every row,
> Checks A/C/D done, no `**` marks in output. Phase 3 may begin only when all four
> conditions are met simultaneously.

---

## Phase 3 -- Finalize

*Phase 3 requires: Phase 2 complete (5-row Registry written, Selected? blank in all rows).*

> **GATE PRECONDITIONS -- both must hold before Phase 3 may begin:**
> - **(a)** All 5 rows of the Peer-Comparison Registry are written in your output
> - **(b)** Selected? is blank across all 5 rows of the Registry
>
> A Registry with fewer than 5 rows does not satisfy (a). A Registry where any
> Selected? cell holds any value does not satisfy (b). Both conditions must hold
> simultaneously before any finalization step below may proceed.

> **Phase 3 opens now.** Phase 2 complete. Peer-comparison validated. AMEND finalized.

Fill Selected? = YES in exactly 5 rows (candidates confirmed in Check B, with any
substitutions from Prohibition B applied). Mark those 5 ideas with `**` on their
headings in the dimension sections. Use the AMEND content finalized in Check C.

Write the artifact to:
`simulations/draft/brainstorm/{{topic}}-brainstorm-{{date}}.md`

```yaml
---
skill: draft-brainstorm
topic: {{topic}}
date: {{date}}
---
```

Artifact order: Inertia paragraph (1a), Phase 0 baseline block (Trajectory / Cost /
Displacement Target), dimension sections (top-5 marked, lens tags removed), Peer-
Comparison Registry, AMEND (3 directions, distribution-shift-verified). Total ideas
including Do Nothing: 20-40.

> **Phase 3 complete.** Artifact written to `simulations/draft/brainstorm/{{topic}}-brainstorm-{{date}}.md`. All phases closed.

> **Session complete.** All five phases executed. Artifact written.
```

## R17 Score Summary

| Variation | Axis | Score (v15) | Score (hyp v17) | Score (hyp v18) | Notes |
|-----------|------|------------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| V-01 | Session close only (C-47) | 180 | 190 | 192.5 | C-47 PASS, C-48 FAIL |
| V-02 | Session double-mark (C-47+C-48) | 180 | 190 | 195 | First to 195 |
| V-03 | Baseline: V-02 R16 exact | 180 | 190 | 190 | No session envelope |
| V-04 | Session double-mark + roster | 180 | 190 | 195 | C-49 candidate (roster) |
| V-05 | Session double-mark conversational | 180 | 190 | 192.5 or 195 | C-48 form-test |

**Lifecycle chain status after R17:**

| Layer | Open signal | Close signal | Criteria | Status |
|-------|------------|-------------|---------|--------|
| Session (outermost) | C-48 (R17 candidate) | C-47 (R17 candidate) | R17 | Unrewarded in v15 |
| Pre-Phase | C-40 | C-39 | R14 | Rewarded |
| Phase 0 | C-38 | C-37 | R13 | Rewarded |
| Phase 1 | C-42 | C-41 | R15 | Rewarded |
| Phase 2 | C-44 | C-43 | R16 candidates | Unrewarded in v15 |
| Phase 3 | C-46 | C-45 | R16 candidates | Unrewarded in v15 |

**Max trajectory**: 180 (v15) → 185 (v16: +C-43/C-44) → 190 (v17: +C-45/C-46) → 195 (v18: +C-47/C-48 from R17) → 200 (v19: +C-49/C-50 from R18)

**Lineage position**: C-47/C-48 complete the dual-anchor lifecycle chain at the session level.
The chain now covers six distinct lifecycle layers from outermost (session) to innermost
(Phase 3), each independently doubly-marked. R18 would require a genuinely new dimension
-- either a sub-phase lifecycle (AMEND section, artifact-write section), or a
cross-phase signal (Phase 3 explicitly references Phase 0), or an orthogonal axis entirely.
