  v9 adds C-21 (INERTIA-GATE at Phase 5 entry AND Phase 6 entry, each carrying an
  independent HOLDS exclusion), C-22 (Phase 1 read-barrier covers the mid-run
  restart case -- restart-without-context must not trigger file re-reads), and C-23
  (standalone verdict vocabulary block before Phase 5, structurally separate from
  phase instructions). All three extracted from R8 V-03/V-05 excellence patterns.
  Formula denominator changes to 30 (15 aspirational x 2 max each).
round_targets: >
  C-21 full pass: INERTIA-GATE at both Phase 5 entry and Phase 6 entry; Phase 6 label
  independently restates HOLDS exclusion without relying on Phase 5 label.
  C-22 full pass: Phase 1 barrier has explicit restart clause alongside first-run
  constraint; clause prohibits file re-read to reconstruct context after restart;
  stated at the barrier, not in a separate rationale section.
  C-23 full pass: Dedicated verdict vocabulary block present before Phase 5; defines
  DEFEATED (-> Phase 6) and HOLDS (-> NO CHANGE, no path to Phase 6) as standalone
  definitions; structurally separate from phase instructions.

## V-01 -- Axis: Dual-site INERTIA-GATE (C-21)

**Variation axis**: INERTIA-GATE appears at two explicitly labeled independent structural
sites: "Site 1 of 2 -- Phase 5 entry" and "Site 2 of 2 -- Phase 6 entry". Each site
carries a self-contained HOLDS exclusion. The Phase 6 site does not reference Phase 5
to establish the constraint -- a reviewer of Phase 6 alone can verify HOLDS exclusion
without reading Phase 5.

**Hypothesis**: C-21 full pass requires the Phase 6 gate to be independent -- not a
back-reference. Labeling Phase 6 entry with "HOLDS dimensions have no path to this
phase -- enforced independently at this site, without relying on Phase 5 to carry the
constraint" makes C-21 auditable at the Phase 6 boundary alone. The "Site 1 of 2 /
Site 2 of 2" naming makes dual-site architecture explicit in the prompt text. A scorer
can verify both sites exist by scanning the prompt rather than inferring from phase
ordering. V-01 does not add restart clause (C-22) or standalone verdict vocabulary
(C-23) -- those are isolated in V-02 and V-03.

## INERTIA COMPETITOR DECLARATION

[>> GUARD: INERTIA PRIOR <<]
[>> Bias blocked: action-default bias -- change is not the default; INERTIA is <<]
[>> Mechanism: Every phase tests whether challenger evidence defeats the incumbent
     position. INERTIA wins without evidence. Change requires a verdict. <<]

INERTIA is the named competitor. INERTIA wins by default.
Zero proposals is a valid, complete, excellent execution.
The burden of proof rests entirely on the challenger (new signal evidence).

## Output Schema -- Committed Before Any File Is Read

[>> GUARD: SCHEMA COMMITMENT <<]
[>> Bias blocked: post-hoc rationalization -- columns fixed before evidence is seen <<]
[>> Mechanism: A schema committed before reading cannot be retrospectively adjusted
     to fit the evidence shape. Column violations are detectable against this block. <<]

The following schemas are fixed. No column may be added, removed, or renamed.

Phase 1 -- Defense register:
| Defense ID | Dimension | INERTIA's best defense | Defeating evidence requirement |

Phase 2 -- Signal inventory:
| Artifact filename | Artifact date | NEW / PRIOR | Namespace |

Phase 4 -- Delta findings (per category):
| Finding ID | Category | Dimension | Understanding changed: prior -> now | Source artifact |

Phase 5 -- Defeat assessment:
| Defense ID | Dimension | INERTIA's defense | Challenger evidence | Verdict (DEFEATED / HOLDS) | Consequence if HOLDS |

Phase 6a -- Additions:
| # | Dimension | Evidence | Before | After | Confidence | Consequence if unchanged | Inertia defeated because |

Phase 6b -- Removals and Reprioritizations:

## Phase 1 -- Pre-Signal Defense Register

[>> GUARD: PHASE-1-READ-BARRIER <<]
[>> Bias blocked: anchor bias <<]
[>> Mechanism: Defenses written before any file is read declare prior belief.
     Defenses written after reading rationalize evidence -- not a valid anchor-bias
     block. This is the only structural position where genuine prior belief can be
     captured. <<]

ENTRY CONDITION: No files have been read yet.
DO NOT read strategy.md or any signal file before Phase 1 is complete.
If any file has been read, restart Phase 1 without it in context.

| Defense ID | Dimension | INERTIA's best defense | Defeating evidence requirement |

EXIT CRITERION: Defense register table present; each known dimension has a row;
no file has been read. Phase 2 may NOT open until this is met.

---

## Phase 2 -- Signal Inventory
[Bias blocked: recency bias -- full namespace scan before strategy frame opens]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 1 EXIT CRITERION met (defense register present; no file read).
Do NOT begin Phase 2 until Phase 1 EXIT CRITERION is confirmed in output above.

Scan simulations/ for artifacts matching the topic slug across all 9 namespaces:
scout / draft / review / flow / trace / prove / listen / program / topic

Read TOPICS.md to locate strategy.md. Record STRATEGY DATE as a named field
before classification begins.
Date rule: NEW = artifact date > STRATEGY DATE | PRIOR = artifact date <= STRATEGY DATE

| Artifact filename | Artifact date | NEW / PRIOR | Namespace |

All 9 namespaces must appear. Zero-artifact namespaces emit an explicit null row.

[>> GUARD: SIGNAL READ-LOCK <<]
[>> Bias blocked: confirmation bias; vocabulary contamination <<]
[>> Mechanism: Signal files are fixed as of this inventory. Re-reading a signal
     file after this point introduces post-hoc vocabulary alignment with the strategy
     frame. This lock closes that path. Signal files may NOT be re-read after this
     inventory is written. All subsequent phases use the written inventory only. <<]

EXIT CRITERION: Inventory table present; all 9 namespaces covered (explicit null rows
for empty namespaces); SIGNAL READ-LOCK in effect.
Phase 3 may NOT open until this is met.

---

## Phase 3 -- Read Strategy
[Bias blocked: framing bias -- signals already classified; strategy vocabulary cannot anchor retroactively]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 2 EXIT CRITERION met.
Do NOT read strategy.md until Phase 2 EXIT CRITERION is confirmed in output above.

Read strategy.md. Record:
- STRATEGY DATE as a named field
- Goal statement (verbatim or paraphrase)
- Every planned signal entry by namespace

EXIT CRITERION: STRATEGY DATE recorded as named field; goal statement present;
planned signals enumerated by namespace. Phase 4 may NOT open until this is met.

---

## Phase 4 -- Delta Analysis
[Bias blocked: confirmation bias -- four-category forcing function prevents selective classification]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 3 EXIT CRITERION met.
Do NOT begin delta analysis until Phase 3 EXIT CRITERION is confirmed in output above.

For each NEW artifact, classify each finding. Do not merge categories.

### CONFIRMED -- INERTIA's assumptions validated by NEW signals
| Finding ID | Category | Dimension | Understanding changed: prior -> now | Source artifact |
Null: "CONFIRMED: none -- no NEW artifacts validate INERTIA's assumptions."

### EXPANDED -- INERTIA's assumptions broadened by NEW signals
| Finding ID | Category | Dimension | Understanding changed: prior -> now | Source artifact |
Null: "EXPANDED: none -- no NEW artifacts expand INERTIA's assumptions."

### UNEXPECTED -- dimensions INERTIA's strategy did not cover
| Finding ID | Category | Dimension | Understanding changed: prior -> now | Source artifact |
Null: "UNEXPECTED: none -- no NEW artifacts reveal uncovered dimensions."

### CHALLENGED -- INERTIA's assumptions directly questioned
| Finding ID | Category | Dimension | Understanding changed: prior -> now | Source artifact |
Null: "CHALLENGED: none -- no NEW artifacts challenge INERTIA's assumptions."

EXIT CRITERION: All four category tables present with labeled nulls; each NEW
artifact appears in at least one category. Phase 5 may NOT open until this is met.

## Phase 5 -- INERTIA DEFEAT ASSESSMENT

[>> GUARD: INERTIA-GATE [Site 1 of 2 -- Phase 5 entry] <<]
[>> Bias blocked: action-default bias; status-quo neglect <<]
[>> Mechanism: HOLDS is the default verdict and requires no evidence; DEFEATED requires
     specific named signal evidence. Both verdicts are structurally equal outputs -- a
     dimension without an explicit verdict is a structural gap. Only DEFEATED dimensions
     advance to Phase 6. HOLDS dimensions have no path to Phase 6. This enforcement is
     at the Phase 5 entry site. A second, independent enforcement exists at Phase 6
     entry (Site 2 of 2). <<]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 4 EXIT CRITERION met (all four delta categories present).
Do NOT open Phase 5 until Phase 4 EXIT CRITERION is confirmed in output above.

Verdict semantics:
- DEFEATED: challenger evidence overcomes INERTIA's Phase 1 defense for this dimension.
  Dimension advances to Phase 6.
- HOLDS: INERTIA's defense survives. Dimension receives NO CHANGE.
  Dimension has no path to Phase 6.

| Defense ID | Dimension | INERTIA's defense | Challenger evidence | Verdict (DEFEATED / HOLDS) | Consequence if HOLDS |

Confidence tiers (DEFEATED rows only):
- HIGH: two or more independent NEW artifacts on the same dimension
- MEDIUM: one NEW artifact
- LOW: inference only

If all verdicts are HOLDS: emit "NULL_DELTA: INERTIA RETAINED ACROSS ALL DIMENSIONS."
Stop. Phase 6 does NOT open.

EXIT CRITERION: Verdict table complete; all dimensions adjudicated; NULL_DELTA emitted
if all HOLDS; at least one DEFEATED verdict present to proceed to Phase 6.

---

## Phase 6 -- Change Proposals (DEFEATED dimensions only)

[>> GUARD: INERTIA-GATE [Site 2 of 2 -- Phase 6 entry] <<]
[>> Bias blocked: action-default bias <<]
[>> Mechanism: HOLDS dimensions have no row and no path to this phase. This enforcement
     is independent of Site 1 at Phase 5. A model that bypasses Phase 5 and arrives
     directly at Phase 6 still encounters this gate. HOLDS exclusion is enforced here
     without relying on the Phase 5 site to carry the constraint. A reviewer can
     confirm HOLDS exclusion from this block alone, without reading Phase 5. <<]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 5 EXIT CRITERION met; at least one DEFEATED verdict present;
NULL_DELTA not emitted. Do NOT open Phase 6 if NULL_DELTA was emitted in Phase 5.

### 6a -- Additions
| # | Dimension | Evidence | Before | After | Confidence | Consequence if unchanged | Inertia defeated because |
Null: "ADDITIONS: none -- INERTIA holds on all addition candidates."

### 6b -- Removals and Reprioritizations
| # | Action (REMOVE / REPRIORITIZE) | Dimension | Evidence | Before | After | Confidence | Consequence if unchanged | Inertia defeated because |
Null-REMOVALS: "REMOVALS: none -- INERTIA holds."
Null-REPRIORITIZATIONS: "REPRIORITIZATIONS: none -- INERTIA holds."

All 9 namespaces must have a row. Silence is not a null declaration.

EXIT CRITERION: All three change-type tables present with labeled nulls; all 9
namespaces covered; each DEFEATED dimension from Phase 5 has a corresponding row.
Phase 7 may NOT open until this is met.

## Phase 7 -- Confirmation Gate

[>> GUARD: CONFIRMATION GATE <<]
[>> Bias blocked: recency bias; sunk-cost bias <<]
[>> Mechanism: The most-recently-read signals are disproportionately salient at this

     the full proposal set is reviewed. The absence of NO is not implicit YES. <<]

[>> GUARD: WRITE GUARD <<]
[>> Bias blocked: premature closure bias <<]
[>> Mechanism: strategy.md is not modified until explicit YES or REVISED is received
     at this gate. strategy.md has NOT been modified at this point. <<]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 6 EXIT CRITERION met.
Do NOT modify strategy.md before Phase 7 confirmation is received.

Present: Phase 4 delta findings (all four categories), Phase 6 proposals (6a and 6b).

---
PENDING CONFIRMATION -- strategy.md has NOT been modified.
INERTIA currently holds. Proposed challenges: [N] additions / [N] removals / [N] reprioritizations

Reply YES to displace INERTIA on all listed dimensions
Reply NO to retain INERTIA (all dimensions unchanged)
Reply REVISED + edited table to displace INERTIA on custom dimensions
Reply WITHDRAW [#] to remove specific proposals before confirming

Do NOT write to strategy.md before this ENTRY CONDITION is confirmed.

[>> GUARD: WRITE GUARD (confirmed) <<]

## V-02 -- Axis: Restart Isolation Clause in Phase 1 (C-22)

**Variation axis**: The Phase 1 read-barrier contains two parallel isolation clauses:
FIRST-RUN ISOLATION (existing) and RESTART ISOLATION (new). The restart clause
explicitly prohibits re-reading any file to reconstruct state if execution resumes
without prior context. Both clauses appear inline at the Phase 1 barrier -- not in
a rationale section.

**Hypothesis**: C-22 full pass requires the mid-run restart scenario to be named and
prohibited at the Phase 1 barrier itself. A barrier that only covers first-run ("no
files read yet") leaves the restart path open: a model resuming after context loss
might naturally re-read strategy.md or signal files to reconstruct where it was, which
contaminates Phase 1 as completely as skipping it. The explicit restart clause makes
the violation structurally visible -- a restart re-read is prohibited by name, not
merely unmentioned. V-02 does not add Site 1/2 dual-gate labeling (V-01's axis) or
standalone verdict vocabulary (V-03's axis). INERTIA-GATE appears at Phase 5 and
Phase 6 using the R8 V-05 format.

## Phase 1 -- Pre-Signal Defense Register

[>> GUARD: PHASE-1-READ-BARRIER <<]
[>> Bias blocked: anchor bias <<]
[>> Mechanism: Defenses written before any file is read declare prior belief.
     Defenses written after reading rationalize evidence. This is the only structural
     position where genuine prior belief can be captured. <<]

FIRST-RUN ISOLATION: No files have been read yet.
DO NOT read strategy.md or any signal file before Phase 1 is complete.
If any file has been read, restart Phase 1 without it in context.

RESTART ISOLATION: If execution resumes after an interruption without prior context,
do NOT re-read strategy.md or any signal file to reconstruct the state of this run.
Write the defense register from prior knowledge only. Re-reading files to catch up
after a mid-run restart contaminates Phase 1 as effectively as skipping it entirely.
The defense register must reflect beliefs before evidence -- not beliefs reconstructed
from evidence previously seen in a prior interrupted session.

ENTRY CONDITION: No files have been read since Phase 1 began (first run or restart).
Phase 2 may NOT open until this is met.

## V-03 -- Axis: Standalone Verdict Vocabulary Block before Phase 5 (C-23)

**Variation axis**: A dedicated "## Verdict Vocabulary" section appears before Phase 5
as a structurally independent block. It defines DEFEATED and HOLDS with forward-path
statements as standalone definitions. Phase 5 references the block rather than
redefining the vocabulary inline. A scorer can verify verdict semantics from this
block alone, without reading Phase 5 instructions.

**Hypothesis**: C-23 distinguishes between verdict semantics defined anywhere in the
skill (C-13 pass) and verdict semantics encapsulated in a self-contained block before
Phase 5 (C-23 pass). R8 V-05 had verdict semantics embedded within Phase 5
instructions after the ENTRY CONDITION -- a reader verifying semantics had to locate
the correct sub-block within Phase 5. Moving the definitions to a standalone section
before Phase 5 makes them independently verifiable: a reviewer can confirm both
DEFEATED (-> Phase 6) and HOLDS (-> NO CHANGE, no path to Phase 6) without reading
any phase instructions. V-03 does not add Site 1/2 dual-gate labeling (V-01's axis)
or the restart clause (V-02's axis).

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 2 EXIT CRITERION met.
Do NOT read strategy.md until Phase 2 EXIT CRITERION is confirmed in output above.

Read strategy.md. Record:

## Phase 4 -- Delta Analysis
[Bias blocked: confirmation bias -- four-category forcing function prevents selective classification]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 3 EXIT CRITERION met.
Do NOT begin delta analysis until Phase 3 EXIT CRITERION is confirmed in output above.

For each NEW artifact, classify each finding. Do not merge categories.

### CONFIRMED -- INERTIA's assumptions validated by NEW signals

## Verdict Vocabulary

[>> GUARD: VERDICT SEMANTICS BLOCK <<]
[>> Bias blocked: definitional ambiguity -- both verdict outcomes fully specified as
     standalone definitions, independently verifiable without reading Phase 5 <<]
[>> Mechanism: A scorer or auditor can confirm verdict semantics from this block alone.
     Distributing definitions across phase instructions requires reading all of Phase 5
     to reconstruct the semantics. This block makes them atomic and self-contained.
     Phase 5 applies these definitions; it does not redefine them. <<]

DEFEATED: Challenger evidence overcomes INERTIA's Phase 1 defense for this dimension.
  Forward path: dimension advances to Phase 6 (Change Proposals).

HOLDS: INERTIA's defense survives for this dimension. Dimension receives NO CHANGE.
  Forward path: no path to Phase 6. Execution for this dimension ends at Phase 5.

These two verdicts are exhaustive. No other verdict tokens are valid in the defeat
assessment table.

Confidence tier for DEFEATED rows (defined here; applied in Phase 5):
- HIGH: two or more independent NEW artifacts support the defeat on this dimension
- MEDIUM: one NEW artifact
- LOW: inference only (no direct NEW artifact evidence)

---

## Phase 5 -- INERTIA DEFEAT ASSESSMENT

[>> GUARD: INERTIA-GATE <<]
[>> Bias blocked: action-default bias; status-quo neglect <<]
[>> Mechanism: HOLDS is the default verdict and requires no evidence; DEFEATED requires
     specific named signal evidence. Both verdicts are structurally equal outputs.
     Only DEFEATED dimensions advance to Phase 6. HOLDS dimensions have no path
     to Phase 6. <<]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 4 EXIT CRITERION met (all four delta categories present).
Do NOT open Phase 5 until Phase 4 EXIT CRITERION is confirmed in output above.

Apply the Verdict Vocabulary defined above. Do not redefine DEFEATED or HOLDS here.

| Defense ID | Dimension | INERTIA's defense | Challenger evidence | Verdict (DEFEATED / HOLDS) | Consequence if HOLDS |

If all verdicts are HOLDS: emit "NULL_DELTA: INERTIA RETAINED ACROSS ALL DIMENSIONS."
Stop. Phase 6 does NOT open.

EXIT CRITERION: Verdict table complete; all dimensions adjudicated; NULL_DELTA emitted
if all HOLDS; at least one DEFEATED verdict to proceed to Phase 6.

---

## Phase 6 -- Change Proposals (DEFEATED dimensions only)

[>> GUARD: INERTIA-GATE (Phase 6 entry) <<]
[>> Bias blocked: action-default bias <<]
[>> Mechanism: Only DEFEATED dimensions from Phase 5 appear here. HOLDS dimensions
     have no row and no path to this phase. <<]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 5 EXIT CRITERION met; at least one DEFEATED verdict present;
NULL_DELTA not emitted. Do NOT open Phase 6 if NULL_DELTA was emitted in Phase 5.

### 6a -- Additions
| # | Dimension | Evidence | Before | After | Confidence | Consequence if unchanged | Inertia defeated because |
Null: "ADDITIONS: none -- INERTIA holds on all addition candidates."

### 6b -- Removals and Reprioritizations

Null-REMOVALS: "REMOVALS: none -- INERTIA holds."
Null-REPRIORITIZATIONS: "REPRIORITIZATIONS: none -- INERTIA holds."

All 9 namespaces must have a row. Silence is not a null declaration.

EXIT CRITERION: All three change-type tables present; all 9 namespaces covered; each
DEFEATED dimension has a row. Phase 7 may NOT open until this is met.

## Phase 7 -- Confirmation Gate

[>> GUARD: CONFIRMATION GATE <<]
[>> Bias blocked: recency bias; sunk-cost bias <<]

     is not implicit YES. <<]

[>> GUARD: WRITE GUARD <<]
[>> Bias blocked: premature closure bias <<]
[>> Mechanism: strategy.md is not modified until explicit YES or REVISED is received.
     strategy.md has NOT been modified at this point. <<]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 6 EXIT CRITERION met.
Do NOT modify strategy.md before Phase 7 confirmation is received.

Present: Phase 4 delta findings (all four categories), Phase 6 proposals (6a and 6b).

## V-04 -- Combined: Dual-site INERTIA-GATE + Restart Isolation (C-21 + C-22)

**Variation axes**: V-01 (Site 1 of 2 / Site 2 of 2 INERTIA-GATE labeling, C-21) +
V-02 (FIRST-RUN ISOLATION + RESTART ISOLATION parallel clauses, C-22).

**Hypothesis**: C-21 and C-22 are independently testable. A prompt can have dual-site
INERTIA-GATE labeling (C-21) while leaving the restart path open (C-22 fail). And
vice versa. The combination tests whether both constraints coexist without structural
tension: the Site 1/2 gate framing is about Phase 5/6 boundary; the restart clause
is about Phase 1. They are spatially separated in the prompt and structurally
orthogonal. V-04 does not include standalone verdict vocabulary (C-23 -- reserved for
V-05). Verdict semantics remain embedded within Phase 5.

## INERTIA COMPETITOR DECLARATION

[>> GUARD: INERTIA PRIOR <<]
[>> Bias blocked: action-default bias -- change is not the default; INERTIA is <<]
[>> Mechanism: Every phase tests whether challenger evidence defeats the incumbent
     position. INERTIA wins without evidence. Change requires a verdict. <<]

INERTIA is the named competitor. INERTIA wins by default.
Zero proposals is a valid, complete, excellent execution.
The burden of proof rests entirely on the challenger (new signal evidence).

## Output Schema -- Committed Before Any File Is Read

[>> GUARD: SCHEMA COMMITMENT <<]
[>> Bias blocked: post-hoc rationalization -- columns fixed before evidence is seen <<]
[>> Mechanism: A schema committed before reading cannot be retrospectively adjusted.
     Column violations are detectable against this block. <<]

Phase 1 -- Defense register:
| Defense ID | Dimension | INERTIA's best defense | Defeating evidence requirement |

Phase 2 -- Signal inventory:
| Artifact filename | Artifact date | NEW / PRIOR | Namespace |

Phase 4 -- Delta findings (per category):
| Finding ID | Category | Dimension | Understanding changed: prior -> now | Source artifact |

Phase 5 -- Defeat assessment:

## Phase 1 -- Pre-Signal Defense Register

[>> GUARD: PHASE-1-READ-BARRIER <<]
[>> Bias blocked: anchor bias <<]
[>> Mechanism: Defenses written before any file is read declare prior belief.
     Defenses written after reading rationalize evidence. This is the only structural
     position where genuine prior belief can be captured. <<]

FIRST-RUN ISOLATION: No files have been read yet.
DO NOT read strategy.md or any signal file before Phase 1 is complete.
If any file has been read, restart Phase 1 without it in context.

RESTART ISOLATION: If execution resumes after an interruption without prior context,
do NOT re-read strategy.md or any signal file to reconstruct the state of this run.
Write the defense register from prior knowledge only. Re-reading files to catch up
after a mid-run restart contaminates Phase 1 as effectively as skipping it entirely.
The defense register must reflect beliefs before evidence -- not beliefs reconstructed
from evidence previously seen in a prior interrupted session.

ENTRY CONDITION: No files have been read since Phase 1 began (first run or restart).

| Defense ID | Dimension | INERTIA's best defense | Defeating evidence requirement |

EXIT CRITERION: Defense register table present; each known dimension has a row; no
file has been read (first run or restart). Phase 2 may NOT open until this is met.

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 1 EXIT CRITERION met.
Do NOT begin Phase 2 until Phase 1 EXIT CRITERION is confirmed in output above.

Scan simulations/ for artifacts matching the topic slug across all 9 namespaces:

Read TOPICS.md to locate strategy.md. Record STRATEGY DATE as a named field
before classification begins.
Date rule: NEW = artifact date > STRATEGY DATE | PRIOR = artifact date <= STRATEGY DATE

| Artifact filename | Artifact date | NEW / PRIOR | Namespace |

All 9 namespaces must appear. Zero-artifact namespaces emit an explicit null row.

[>> GUARD: SIGNAL READ-LOCK <<]
[>> Bias blocked: confirmation bias; vocabulary contamination <<]
[>> Mechanism: Signal files are fixed as of this inventory. Re-reading after this
     point introduces post-hoc vocabulary alignment. All subsequent phases use the
     written inventory only. Signal files may NOT be re-read after this inventory. <<]

EXIT CRITERION: Inventory table present; all 9 namespaces covered; SIGNAL READ-LOCK
in effect. Phase 3 may NOT open until this is met.

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 4 EXIT CRITERION met (all four delta categories present).
Do NOT open Phase 5 until Phase 4 EXIT CRITERION is confirmed in output above.

Verdict semantics:
- DEFEATED: challenger evidence overcomes INERTIA's Phase 1 defense for this dimension.
  Dimension advances to Phase 6.

  Dimension has no path to Phase 6.

| Defense ID | Dimension | INERTIA's defense | Challenger evidence | Verdict (DEFEATED / HOLDS) | Consequence if HOLDS |

Confidence tiers (DEFEATED rows only):

If all verdicts are HOLDS: emit "NULL_DELTA: INERTIA RETAINED ACROSS ALL DIMENSIONS."
Stop. Phase 6 does NOT open.

EXIT CRITERION: Verdict table complete; all dimensions adjudicated; NULL_DELTA emitted

     without relying on the Phase 5 site to carry the constraint. A reviewer can
     confirm HOLDS exclusion from this block alone, without reading Phase 5. <<]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 5 EXIT CRITERION met; at least one DEFEATED verdict present;

## V-05 -- Full Integration: Dual-site INERTIA-GATE + Restart Isolation + Standalone Verdict Vocabulary (C-21 + C-22 + C-23)

**Variation axes**: V-01 (Site 1 of 2 / Site 2 of 2 INERTIA-GATE, C-21) + V-02
(FIRST-RUN ISOLATION + RESTART ISOLATION at Phase 1 barrier, C-22) + V-03 (standalone
Verdict Vocabulary block before Phase 5, C-23).

**Hypothesis**: All three criteria are orthogonal. A prompt can have dual-site
INERTIA-GATE (C-21) while leaving the restart path open (C-22 fail) and the verdict
vocabulary embedded in Phase 5 (C-23 fail). The full integration tests whether all
three coexist without structural interference. The three mechanisms are spatially
separated: restart clause is at Phase 1, verdict vocabulary is a standalone block
between Phase 4 and Phase 5, dual-site gates are at Phase 5 and Phase 6 boundaries.
V-05 inherits all R8 V-05 features (entry/exit conditions, inline guard labels at
every site, INERTIA competitor framing, output schema commitment) and adds the three
new R9 structural features on top.

Null-REPRIORITIZATIONS: "REPRIORITIZATIONS: none -- INERTIA holds."

All 9 namespaces must have a row. Silence is not a null declaration.

EXIT CRITERION: All three change-type tables present with labeled nulls; all 9
namespaces covered; each DEFEATED dimension from Phase 5 has a corresponding row.
Phase 7 may NOT open until this is met.

## Phase 7 -- Confirmation Gate

[>> GUARD: CONFIRMATION GATE <<]
[>> Bias blocked: recency bias; sunk-cost bias <<]
[>> Mechanism: The most-recently-read signals are disproportionately salient at this
     point. This gate requires explicit user confirmation before any write, ensuring
     the full proposal set is reviewed. The absence of NO is not implicit YES. <<]

[>> GUARD: WRITE GUARD <<]
[>> Bias blocked: premature closure bias <<]
[>> Mechanism: strategy.md is not modified until explicit YES or REVISED is received
     at this gate. The write step does not execute based on agent confidence in the
     proposals -- only on explicit user authorization. strategy.md has NOT been
     modified at this point. <<]

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 6 EXIT CRITERION met.
Do NOT modify strategy.md before Phase 7 confirmation is received.

Present: Phase 4 delta findings (all four categories), Phase 6 proposals (all
three tables -- 6a and 6b).

---
PENDING CONFIRMATION -- strategy.md has NOT been modified.
INERTIA currently holds. Proposed challenges: [N] additions / [N] removals / [N] reprioritizations

Reply YES to displace INERTIA on all listed dimensions
Reply NO to retain INERTIA (all dimensions unchanged)
Reply REVISED + edited table to displace INERTIA on custom dimensions
Reply WITHDRAW [#] to remove specific proposals before confirming
  WITHDRAW syntax: WITHDRAW [2] or WITHDRAW [1, 3]. Removes named proposals only;
  remainder is applied.
  WITHDRAW is not NO (rejects all) and not REVISED (requires a resubmitted table).
---
STOP HERE. Write nothing further until the user replies.

EXIT CRITERION: User has replied YES, NO, REVISED, or WITHDRAW.

## Phase 8 -- Apply (after YES or REVISED only)

ENTRY CONDITION: Phase 7 EXIT CRITERION met (explicit YES or REVISED received).
Do NOT write to strategy.md before this ENTRY CONDITION is confirmed.

[>> GUARD: WRITE GUARD (confirmed) <<]
[>> Bias blocked: premature closure bias -- write authorized by user at Phase 7 <<]

Write confirmed (non-withdrawn) changes to strategy.md.
No reformatting of unchanged sections.
Confirm: "strategy.md updated: [N] additions, [N] removals, [N] reprioritizations.
INERTIA displaced on: [dimension list]."
