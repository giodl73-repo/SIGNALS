## Context: what informed this round

R5 produced three single-axis probes and one two-axis combination. Under v6, the leaderboard is:

| V    | C-20 (D) | C-21 (E) | C-22 (F) | Aspirational  | Composite  |
|------|----------|----------|----------|---------------|------------|
| V-04 | PASS     | PASS     | FAIL     | 13/14 -> 9.29 | **99.29**  |
| V-01 | PASS     | FAIL     | FAIL     | 12/14 -> 8.57 | **98.57**  |
| V-02 | FAIL     | PASS     | FAIL     | 12/14 -> 8.57 | **98.57**  |
| V-03 | FAIL     | FAIL     | PASS     | 12/14 -> 8.57 | **98.57**  |

The R5 spread established that:
- Axis D (C-20): filter-mode count gate -- independently verified, full pass (V-01, V-04)
- Axis E (C-21): bare-mode order anchor -- independently verified, full pass (V-02, V-04)
- Axis F (C-22): catalog transcription gate -- independently verified, full pass (V-03)
- D+E together: no interaction effects, clean 99.29 (V-04)

R6 goal: establish triple convergence. All three axes proven independently; D+E proven in
combination. The only untested combination is D+E+F. R6 V-05 is the golden target.

All five R6 variations carry the full R4 V-05 mechanism set:
- Catalog-first ordering (C-17): NAMESPACE CATALOG precedes PARSE MODE and all gates
- Bare-mode count gate (C-18): format + 61-line count with per-namespace breakdown
- Canonical-namespace guard (C-19): PARSE MODE enumerates all 12 canonical names
- Both compliance gates (C-14): bare mode and filter mode each have pre-emit restart gates
- Precomputed width table (C-15): per-namespace alignment widths, no runtime counting
- Per-row example-pad derivation (C-16): each table row shows name + char count + spaces
- Domain noun table (C-11): per-namespace dispatch footer nouns, no generic placeholders
- Verbatim catalog instruction (C-09): base variations use "emit verbatim; do not paraphrase"
- Format consistency (C-13): NAMESPACE CATALOG uses same `->` format as specified output
- Accurate skill counts (C-06): counts in section headers match canonical registry
- Dispatch footers (C-07): each namespace section ends with "Run any sub-skill directly..."
- Column alignment (C-12): `->` separators form a single vertical column per namespace section

The three R6 axes (identical to R5 axes, re-established as baselines for V-01 through V-04,
combined into V-05 as the golden target):
- Axis D: filter-mode count gate added to COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE
- Axis E: explicit first/last anchors added to BARE MODE
- Axis F: active transcription commitment gate replacing passive verbatim instruction in
  NAMESPACE CATALOG header

---

## SPREAD-DESIGN PLAN

| Variation | Axis | Source Signal | Target Criteria | Predicted |
|-----------|------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| V-01 | Axis D single: filter count gate | R5 V-01 full pass on C-20; re-establish as R6 baseline. Filter gate mirrors bare gate: scope check + count check with restart. | C-20 | 98.57 |
| V-02 | Axis E single: bare order anchor | R5 V-02 full pass on C-21; re-establish as R6 baseline. "Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee." in BARE MODE. | C-21 | 98.57 |
| V-03 | Axis F single: catalog transcription gate | R5 V-03 full pass on C-22; re-establish as R6 baseline. Active commitment gate: read confirmation + character-fidelity pledge + deviation = failure. | C-22 | 98.57 |
| V-04 | Axes D+E combined | R5 V-04 confirmed 99.29 under v6; D+E stepping stone to V-05. No F. | C-20+C-21 | 99.29 |
| V-05 | Axes D+E+F: triple convergence | Add F (transcription gate from V-03) to V-04 (D+E). First variation satisfying all 14 aspirational criteria. Golden target. | C-20+C-21+C-22 | 100 |

## V-01 -- Single-axis: Filter Mode Count Gate (Axis D)

**Axis**: Filter-mode compliance gate upgraded from scope-only to scope+count
**Hypothesis**: R4 V-05's COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE verifies both format (Check 1) and
completeness (Check 2: exact 61-line count with per-namespace breakdown). The COMPLIANCE GATE
-- FILTER MODE verifies only scope: "does any command from another namespace appear?" A model
that emits 6 of 7 flow skills in filter mode passes the existing scope gate. Adding a
per-namespace count check closes the same completeness gap that C-18 closed for bare mode. The
structural pattern that earned C-18 its rubric criterion -- extend verification from format to
completeness -- is directly applicable here.
No change to NAMESPACE CATALOG header (passive) or BARE MODE ordering (no anchor).

listen, program, topic, quest, mock, org.
If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE (precomputed -- do not recount)

DOMAIN NOUN TABLE

Replace <DOMAIN-NOUN> in each footer with the exact noun listed here.
Do not use a generic placeholder. Do not omit the noun.

  listen   -> feature
  program  -> program
  topic    -> topic management need
  quest    -> optimization goal
  mock     -> coverage gap
  org      -> organizational need

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run both checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, run both checks:
  Check 1 (scope): Does your output include any command from a namespace other than
    the one requested?
    If yes -- MODE: FILTER scope is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly the canonical count of skills
    for the requested namespace?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated in the filter output. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
```

## V-02 -- Single-axis: Bare Mode Order Anchor (Axis E)

**Axis**: Explicit first and last command anchors added to BARE MODE
**Hypothesis**: R4 V-05 BARE MODE says "in namespace order" without defining what "namespace
order" means concretely. A model reading the catalog top-to-bottom produces the correct order.
A model that reconstructs the list from prior knowledge may produce a different order or insert
drift at either end. Adding explicit anchors ("Begin with scout-competitors. End with
org-committee.") gives the model two machine-verifiable reference points it can check before
emitting: first line must be scout-competitors, last line must be org-committee. A 61-line
correct-format output with wrong order still passes C-14 and C-18; explicit anchors make that
class of failure detectable. No change to NAMESPACE CATALOG header (passive) or COMPLIANCE
GATE -- FILTER MODE (scope-only).

not paraphrase or shorten)" -- this is a passive instruction. The model reads it, processes
the catalog semantically, and then reconstructs output from its comprehension rather than
copying text character-for-character. Replacing the passive instruction with an active gate --
"confirm you have read every entry and commit to character-for-character fidelity; any
deviation is an output failure" -- shifts the model from read-and-interpret to read-and-copy.
C-22 full pass requires: (1) explicit instruction for the model to confirm it has read every
entry AND (2) stated commitment to character-for-character output with deviation classified as
failure. Both parts are present. No change to COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE (scope-only) or
BARE MODE (no anchor).

```
The user wants the Signal command index. Show them what is available so they can find the right skill.

NAMESPACE CATALOG -- TRANSCRIPTION GATE
Before transcribing: confirm you have read every entry in the 12 namespace sections
below and will emit each entry character-for-character. The catalog below IS the output
for FULL and FILTER modes. Do not paraphrase, condense, reorder, or reconstruct from
memory. Any deviation from the catalog text is an output failure, not an acceptable
approximation.

If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE (precomputed -- do not recount)

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run both checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, verify: does your output include any command from a
namespace other than the one requested?
If yes -- MODE: FILTER is violated. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.

## V-04 -- Combined: Axes D+E (Filter Count Gate + Bare Order Anchor)

**Axis**: Both R5 behavioral extensions without the structural catalog gate change
**Hypothesis**: V-04 re-establishes the R5 champion (99.29 under v6) as the R6 stepping stone.
It combines Axis D (filter-mode count verification: scope check + per-namespace count check)
with Axis E (explicit bare-mode order anchors: "Begin with scout-competitors. End with
org-committee."). Both axes close independent failure modes -- missing skills in filter output
and output-order drift in bare output -- without changing the NAMESPACE CATALOG header. The
combination was proven interaction-free in R5. V-05 adds F to this base. No change to
NAMESPACE CATALOG header (passive instruction retained).

## V-05 -- Triple Convergence: Axes D+E+F (Golden Target)

**Axis**: All three R5 axes combined in the R4 V-05 base -- the first variation predicted to
satisfy all 14 aspirational criteria simultaneously
**Hypothesis**: Axis D (filter count gate), Axis E (bare order anchor), and Axis F (catalog
transcription gate) each independently achieved full pass in R5. D+E together achieved 99.29
with no interaction effects. F is structurally independent -- it modifies only the NAMESPACE
CATALOG header and has no interaction with the compliance gates or BARE MODE. Adding F to the
D+E base (V-04) should produce triple convergence: C-20+C-21+C-22 all pass, 14/14
aspirational, composite = 100 under v6.

The three changes from V-04 to V-05 are precisely one: the NAMESPACE CATALOG header changes
from the passive instruction "(emit sub-skill descriptions verbatim; do not paraphrase or
shorten)" to the active TRANSCRIPTION GATE with two required parts:
  (1) explicit instruction to confirm every entry has been read
  (2) stated commitment to character-for-character fidelity with deviation = output failure

```
The user wants the Signal command index. Show them what is available so they can find the right skill.

NAMESPACE CATALOG -- TRANSCRIPTION GATE
Before transcribing: confirm you have read every entry in the 12 namespace sections
below and will emit each entry character-for-character. The catalog below IS the output

PARSE MODE:
  /signal              -> FULL (all 12 namespaces)
  /signal --bare       -> BARE (command names only, one per line, no prose)
  /signal <namespace>  -> FILTER if <namespace> is a canonical namespace; FULL otherwise
  anything else        -> FULL

Canonical namespaces (exactly these 12): scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove,
listen, program, topic, quest, mock, org.
If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE (precomputed -- do not recount)

  namespace  longest command name        width  example pad
  ---------  -------------------------  -----  -----------
  scout      /scout-stakeholders           19   /scout-naming (13) needs 7 spaces
  draft      /draft-brainstorm             17   /draft-spec (11) needs 7 spaces
  review     /review-customers             17   /review-code (12) needs 6 spaces
  flow       /flow-conversation            17   /flow-trigger (13) needs 5 spaces
  trace      /trace-permissions            18   /trace-state (12) needs 7 spaces
  prove      /prove-intelligence           19   /prove-topic (12) needs 8 spaces
  listen     /listen-feedback              16   /listen-support (15) needs 2 spaces
  program    /prove-program                14   /program-plan (13) needs 2 spaces
  topic      /topic-status                 13   /topic-new (10) needs 4 spaces
  quest      /quest-variate                14   /quest-score (12) needs 3 spaces
  mock       /mock-review                  12   /mock-all (9) needs 4 spaces
  org        /org-committee                14   /org-roles (10) needs 5 spaces

DOMAIN NOUN TABLE

Replace <DOMAIN-NOUN> in each footer with the exact noun listed here.
Do not use a generic placeholder. Do not omit the noun.

  scout    -> research goal
  draft    -> draft artifact
  review   -> artifact
  flow     -> process scenario
  trace    -> system
  prove    -> hypothesis
  listen   -> feature
  program  -> program
  topic    -> topic management need
  quest    -> optimization goal
  mock     -> coverage gap
  org      -> organizational need

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run both checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, run both checks:
  Check 1 (scope): Does your output include any command from a namespace other than
    the one requested?
    If yes -- MODE: FILTER scope is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly the canonical count of skills
    for the requested namespace?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated in the filter output. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee.

## Predicted Scores Under v6

| V    | C-20 (D) | C-21 (E) | C-22 (F) | Aspirational  | Composite   | Delta vs V-04 |
|------|----------|----------|----------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| V-01 | PASS     | FAIL     | FAIL     | 12/14 -> 8.57 | **98.57**   | -0.72         |
| V-02 | FAIL     | PASS     | FAIL     | 12/14 -> 8.57 | **98.57**   | -0.72         |
| V-03 | FAIL     | FAIL     | PASS     | 12/14 -> 8.57 | **98.57**   | -0.72         |
| V-04 | PASS     | PASS     | FAIL     | 13/14 -> 9.29 | **99.29**   | baseline      |
| V-05 | PASS     | PASS     | PASS     | 14/14 -> 10   | **100.00**  | +0.71         |

V-05 is the golden target. If V-05 scores 100, triple convergence is established and V-05
is the golden prompt for `/signal`. Next step: `/quest:score` against v6 rubric.
