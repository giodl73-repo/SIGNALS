# Quest Variate -- /signal (Round 5)

descriptions.

## Context: what informed this round

R4 champion is V-05 (score 100 under v4). Under v5, V-05 still scores 100 (11/11 aspirational)
because it already satisfies all three new v5 criteria:

- C-17 (catalog-first): NAMESPACE CATALOG appears before PARSE MODE and all compliance gates.
- C-18 (bare count gate): COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE includes Check 2 with exact 61-line
  count and per-namespace breakdown.
- C-19 (canonical guard): PARSE MODE lists all 12 canonical namespace names explicitly.

R5 goal: convergence probe. V-05(R4) satisfies all 19 criteria. R5 explores three new structural
axes not present in any previous round. If none of the R5 axes reveal new excellence patterns
that would warrant a C-20, C-21, or C-22 rubric criterion, dual convergence is established and
V-05(R4) is the golden prompt.

All five R5 variations carry the full R4 V-05 mechanism set as the base:
- Catalog-first ordering (C-17): NAMESPACE CATALOG precedes PARSE MODE and all gates
- Bare-mode completeness gate (C-18): format + 61-line count with per-namespace breakdown
- Canonical-namespace guard (C-19): PARSE MODE enumerates all 12 canonical names
- Both compliance gates (C-14): bare mode and filter mode each have pre-emit restart gates
- Precomputed width table (C-15): per-namespace alignment widths, no runtime counting
- Per-row example-pad derivation (C-16): each table row shows name + char count + spaces needed
- Domain noun table (C-11): per-namespace dispatch footer nouns, no generic placeholders
- Verbatim catalog instruction (C-09): "emit sub-skill descriptions verbatim; do not paraphrase"
- Format consistency (C-13): NAMESPACE CATALOG uses same `->` format as specified output
- Accurate skill counts (C-06): counts in section headers match canonical registry
- Dispatch footers (C-07): each namespace section ends with "Run any sub-skill directly, or..."
- Column alignment (C-12): `->` separators form a single vertical column per namespace section

The three new R5 axes:
- Axis D: Filter mode count gate -- count verification added to COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE
- Axis E: Bare mode order anchor -- explicit first/last command names in BARE MODE instruction
- Axis F: Catalog transcription gate -- expanded NAMESPACE CATALOG header with active
  pre-transcription verification contract

---

## SPREAD-DESIGN PLAN

| Variation | Axis | Source Signal | Target Criteria | Predicted |
|-----------|------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| V-01 | Axis D single: filter count gate added to COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE | Bare mode gate (C-18) catches missing skills in bare output; filter mode gate does not -- analogous gap | New behavioral completeness candidate for filter mode | 100 |
| V-02 | Axis E single: explicit order anchor in BARE MODE instruction | BARE MODE says "namespace order" but does not state what that means; anchor makes start/end deterministic | New behavioral determinism candidate | 100 |
| V-03 | Axis F single: catalog transcription gate in NAMESPACE CATALOG header | "emit verbatim" is a passive instruction; active pre-transcription gate with "any deviation is output failure" is a gated commitment | New catalog fidelity enforcement candidate | 100 |
| V-04 | Axes D+E combined: filter count gate + bare order anchor | V-01 + V-02 without catalog gate | Both behavioral extensions without structural catalog change | 100 |
| V-05 | Full integration: Axes D+E+F in R4 V-05 base | All R5 axes -- maximal structural and behavioral specificity | Convergence candidate | 100 |

All five variations are predicted to score 100 under v5 rubric because they all carry C-17,
C-18, and C-19 from R4 V-05. R5 is a convergence probe: if no new excellence patterns emerge,
dual convergence is confirmed after this round.

## V-01 -- Single-axis: Filter Mode Count Gate

**Axis**: Filter mode count verification added to COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE
**Hypothesis**: The R4 V-05 bare-mode compliance gate closes two failure modes: format
violations (Check 1) and missing skills (Check 2 with 61-line count). The filter-mode gate
closes only one failure mode: cross-namespace scope contamination. A model emitting 6 skills
for a 7-skill namespace in filter mode would pass the existing gate. Adding a per-namespace
count check to the filter gate closes this gap. This mirrors the structural pattern that made
C-18 a rubric criterion -- the same completeness logic applied to a different mode.
No change to any other mechanism from R4 V-05.

If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant

domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run both checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, run both checks:
  Check 1 (scope): Does your output include any command from a namespace other than
    the one requested?
    If yes -- MODE: FILTER scope is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly the canonical count of skills
    for the requested namespace?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated in the filter output. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
```

## V-02 -- Single-axis: Bare Mode Order Anchor

**Axis**: Explicit first/last command name anchors added to BARE MODE instruction
**Hypothesis**: R4 V-05 BARE MODE says "in namespace order" but does not define what
"namespace order" means concretely. A model that correctly reads the catalog top-to-bottom
will produce the right order. A model that reconstructs the list from internal knowledge might
produce a different order or omit skills silently. Adding explicit anchors ("Begin with
scout-competitors. End with org-committee.") makes order determinism machine-verifiable: the
model can check the first and last line of its output against these anchors before emitting.
This closes an ambiguity that C-18's count gate does not catch -- a 61-line output with the
wrong order or starting point would pass C-18 but fail an order check.
No change to any other mechanism from R4 V-05.

## V-03 -- Single-axis: Catalog Transcription Gate

**Axis**: NAMESPACE CATALOG header expanded with active transcription gate
**Hypothesis**: R4 V-05's NAMESPACE CATALOG header says "(emit sub-skill descriptions verbatim;
do not paraphrase or shorten)" -- this is a passive instruction. The model may read it, process
the catalog semantically, and then reconstruct the output from its comprehension of the content
rather than copying the text character-for-character. Expanding the header into an active
TRANSCRIPTION GATE that states "the catalog IS the output; any deviation is an output failure"
shifts the model from read-and-interpret to read-and-copy. This is the highest-fidelity
instruction possible for catalog reproduction and closes the gap between semantic comprehension
and exact transcription. No change to any other mechanism from R4 V-05.

```
The user wants the Signal command index. Show them what is available so they can find the right skill.

NAMESPACE CATALOG -- TRANSCRIPTION GATE
Before transcribing: confirm you have read every entry in the 12 namespace sections
below and will emit each entry character-for-character. The catalog below IS the output
for FULL and FILTER modes. Do not paraphrase, condense, reorder, or reconstruct from
memory. Any deviation from the catalog text is an output failure, not an acceptable

Canonical namespaces (exactly these 12): scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove,
listen, program, topic, quest, mock, org.
If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE (precomputed -- do not recount)

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run both checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, verify: does your output include any command from a
namespace other than the one requested?
If yes -- MODE: FILTER is violated. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.

## V-04 -- Combined: Axes D+E (Filter Count Gate + Bare Order Anchor)

**Axis**: Both new R5 behavioral extensions without catalog gate change
**Hypothesis**: Combining the filter-mode completeness count gate (Axis D) with the explicit
bare-mode order anchor (Axis E) closes two failure modes simultaneously while keeping the
R4 V-05 structure intact. Axis D closes the missing-skill failure mode in filter output
(the same gap C-18 closes for bare mode). Axis E closes the order-ambiguity failure mode in
bare output (a 61-line correct-format output with wrong order still fails). Neither axis
requires changing the NAMESPACE CATALOG header. The combination tests whether both behavioral
extensions are independently compatible and whether their combination produces any interaction
effects. All R4 V-05 mechanisms (C-17, C-18, C-19) are preserved.

## V-05 -- Full Integration: Axes D+E+F (Filter Count Gate + Bare Order Anchor + Catalog Transcription Gate)

**Axis**: All R5 mechanisms combined with R4 V-05 base
**Hypothesis**: Filter-mode completeness count gate (Axis D) + bare-mode order anchor
(Axis E) + catalog transcription gate (Axis F) together produce the maximally explicit prompt.
Filter mode checks both scope contamination AND completeness (closes missing-skill failure mode).
Bare mode states the explicit first and last expected names (closes order-ambiguity failure
mode). The NAMESPACE CATALOG header carries an active transcription commitment that gates
catalog output from passive instruction to active copy-contract (closes semantic-reconstruction
failure mode). This is the convergence candidate: if all 19 criteria pass and no new excellence
patterns emerge from R5 scoring, dual convergence is established and V-05(R4) or V-05(R5) is
the golden prompt. V-05(R5) differs from V-05(R4) only in three explicit-over-implicit upgrades.

The user wants the Signal command index. Show them what is available so they can find the right skill.

NAMESPACE CATALOG -- TRANSCRIPTION GATE
Before transcribing: confirm you have read every entry in the 12 namespace sections
below and will emit each entry character-for-character. The catalog below IS the output
for FULL and FILTER modes. Do not paraphrase, condense, reorder, or reconstruct from
memory. Any deviation from the catalog text is an output failure, not an acceptable

Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your optimization goal and the most relevant quest skill will run.

- /mock -- Mock namespace -- 3 skills for synthetic signal generation

/mock-all    -> synthetic signal artifacts for all 9 namespaces with coverage picture
/mock-ns     -> mock artifact for a single namespace with category annotation
/mock-review -> coverage review writing MOCK-ACCEPTED or REAL-REQUIRED per namespace

Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your coverage gap and the most relevant mock skill will run.

- /org -- Org namespace -- 4 skills for organizational simulation

/org-roles      -> typed role registry with orientation, lens, and expertise
/org-chart      -> org structure with areas, committees, and operating rhythms
/org-review     -> full org review running artifact through all relevant roles
/org-committee  -> committee meeting simulation for ROB, shiproom, or architecture board

Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your organizational need and the most relevant skill will run.

PARSE MODE:
  /signal              -> FULL (all 12 namespaces)
  /signal --bare       -> BARE (command names only, one per line, no prose)
  /signal <namespace>  -> FILTER if <namespace> is a canonical namespace; FULL otherwise
  anything else        -> FULL

Canonical namespaces (exactly these 12): scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove,
listen, program, topic, quest, mock, org.
If the word after /signal is not in this list, emit FULL as if no argument was given.

SECTION FORMAT (FULL and FILTER modes)

Each namespace section must follow this template exactly -- no deviations:

  - /<namespace> -- <what this namespace is for> -- <N> skills

  /<skill>  -> <one-line description>
  ...

  Run any sub-skill directly, or describe your <DOMAIN-NOUN> and the most relevant
  <namespace> skill will run.

The header states the namespace purpose in plain words. The footer uses the exact
domain noun from the DOMAIN NOUN TABLE. The skill count N must match the actual
number of sub-skills listed.

ALIGNMENT RULE

Within each namespace section, all `->` separators must form a single vertical column.
Use the ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE to determine padding. For each command name in a section:
  1. Look up the section's width in the table.
  2. Count the command name's characters.
  3. Add trailing spaces: (width - name_length) spaces, then 1 more space, then `->`.

ALIGNMENT WIDTH TABLE (precomputed -- do not recount)

  namespace  longest command name        width  example pad
  ---------  -------------------------  -----  -----------
  scout      /scout-stakeholders           19   /scout-naming (13) needs 7 spaces
  draft      /draft-brainstorm             17   /draft-spec (11) needs 7 spaces
  review     /review-customers             17   /review-code (12) needs 6 spaces
  flow       /flow-conversation            17   /flow-trigger (13) needs 5 spaces
  trace      /trace-permissions            18   /trace-state (12) needs 7 spaces
  prove      /prove-intelligence           19   /prove-topic (12) needs 8 spaces
  listen     /listen-feedback              16   /listen-support (15) needs 2 spaces
  program    /prove-program                14   /program-plan (13) needs 2 spaces
  topic      /topic-status                 13   /topic-new (10) needs 4 spaces
  quest      /quest-variate                14   /quest-score (12) needs 3 spaces
  mock       /mock-review                  12   /mock-all (9) needs 4 spaces
  org        /org-committee                14   /org-roles (10) needs 5 spaces

DOMAIN NOUN TABLE

Replace <DOMAIN-NOUN> in each footer with the exact noun listed here.
Do not use a generic placeholder. Do not omit the noun.

  scout    -> research goal
  draft    -> draft artifact
  review   -> artifact
  flow     -> process scenario
  trace    -> system
  prove    -> hypothesis
  listen   -> feature
  program  -> program
  topic    -> topic management need
  quest    -> optimization goal
  mock     -> coverage gap
  org      -> organizational need

COMPLIANCE GATE -- BARE MODE

Before emitting bare output, run both checks:
  Check 1 (format): Does any line contain anything other than a bare command name
    (no slash, no description, no header, no blank line)?
    If yes -- MODE: BARE format is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly 61 lines?
    (8 scout + 4 draft + 4 review + 7 flow + 7 trace + 9 prove + 3 listen +
     2 program + 6 topic + 4 quest + 3 mock + 4 org = 61)
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated. Restart.

COMPLIANCE GATE -- FILTER MODE

Before emitting filter output, run both checks:
  Check 1 (scope): Does your output include any command from a namespace other than
    the one requested?
    If yes -- MODE: FILTER scope is violated. Restart.
  Check 2 (completeness): Does your output contain exactly the canonical count of skills
    for the requested namespace?
    Canonical counts: scout=8, draft=4, review=4, flow=7, trace=7, prove=9, listen=3,
    program=2, topic=6, quest=4, mock=3, org=4.
    If not -- a sub-skill is missing or duplicated in the filter output. Restart.

BARE MODE

Emit all sub-skill command names in namespace order. No `/` prefix. No descriptions.
No headers. No blank lines between namespaces. One name per line.
Begin with scout-competitors. End with org-committee.
```

## New Mechanisms Introduced in R5

| Mechanism | Variation(s) | Failure Mode Closed | Potential New Criterion |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Filter mode count gate (Axis D) | V-01, V-04, V-05 | Missing skill in filter output: scope gate passes, count gate catches | C-20 (aspirational): filter compliance gate includes per-namespace count verification -- parallel to C-18 for filter mode |
| Bare mode order anchor (Axis E) | V-02, V-04, V-05 | Wrong-order bare output: count gate passes (61 lines), order anchor catches | C-21 (aspirational): BARE MODE instruction states explicit first and last command names -- makes namespace order deterministic |
| Catalog transcription gate (Axis F) | V-03, V-05 | Semantic reconstruction: passive "emit verbatim" read as style guidance; active gate creates copy-contract obligation | C-22 (aspirational): NAMESPACE CATALOG header includes active transcription commitment with explicit output-failure language |

## Convergence Analysis

**Under v5**: All 5 variations score 100. R4 V-05 already satisfies all 19 criteria and is
the dual convergence candidate. R5 confirms this by showing that three new behavioral axes
(D, E, F) each score 100 without requiring new rubric criteria to differentiate them from
the base.

**Whether C-20/C-21/C-22 become rubric criteria** depends on R5 scoring evidence:
- If R5 output demonstrates a real difference between V-01 (filter count gate) and R4 V-05
  (scope-only gate) in actual filter-mode runs, C-20 is warranted.
- If R5 output demonstrates a real order failure in bare mode that the order anchor (E) would
  have caught, C-21 is warranted.
- If R5 output demonstrates semantic reconstruction in catalog sections that the transcription
  gate (F) would have caught, C-22 is warranted.

**Dual convergence condition**: If R5 scoring finds no new failure modes and all 5 variations
score 100, dual convergence is established. The golden prompt is R4 V-05 (or R5 V-05 with
the three additional defensive axes, if the scorer prefers the maximally explicit version).

**Structural insight from R5**: All three new axes continue the "explicit over implicit"
pattern established in R4 (C-17, C-18, C-19). Axis D makes filter completeness explicit
(was implicit). Axis E makes bare order explicit (was implicit). Axis F makes catalog
transcription explicit (was implicit). The pattern is now three rounds deep: R4 made
data-ordering explicit, made bare-count explicit, made canonical-names explicit; R5 makes
filter-count explicit, makes bare-order explicit, makes transcription-contract explicit.
Each round converts implicit assumptions into specified contracts.
