## R6 Summary

**Axis**: C-47 / C-48 / C-49 — the three new v6 criteria testing unified three-node contract, pipeline-completeness certification, and form-equivalence declaration.

**Axis matrix**:

| V | Axis | C-47 | C-48 | C-49 | C-46 form | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| V-01 | Single — C-47 | FAIL | PASS | PASS | Form A | 40/41 |
| V-02 | Single — C-48 | PASS | FAIL | PASS | Form A | 40/41 |
| V-03 | Single — C-49 | PASS | PASS | FAIL | Form A | 40/41 |
| V-04 | Combined — all PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | Form A | 41/41 |
| V-05 | Combined — alt phrasing | PASS | PASS | PASS | Form B | 41/41 |

**What each variation isolates:**

- **V-01**: Nodes enumerated as a bullet list vs. declared as co-equal peers. Tests whether C-47 requires the unified-contract framing, not just naming all three nodes.
- **V-02**: Full C-46 compliance at all 7 steps, but zero pipeline-completeness certification. Tests whether C-48 scores independently — individual notes don't substitute for a count assertion.
- **V-03**: Bracket notation mandated as the only valid form. Tests whether C-49 fails when equivalence is absent even when all C-46 notes are correctly placed with that mandated form.
- **V-04**: Clean reference — explicit three-node co-equal contract, form-equivalence as a property-level declaration, count commitment + post-analysis certification.
- **V-05**: Alternative phrasing ("three-node self-declaration system" / "independence property is the criterion; form is not") + Form B isolation comments. Tests that both C-47 and C-49 are property-level rather than phrase-specific.

**Key research question across all 5**: Do V-04 and V-05 both score 41/41, confirming that C-47 and C-49 are satisfied by any phrasing that delivers the named properties — not by specific required phrases?
-49 (form equivalence) but lists the three enforcement nodes as separate bullet items rather than declaring them as co-equal peers in a unified local-verifiability contract.
**Hypothesis**: C-47 requires the three nodes to be named as a system, not merely enumerated. A bullet list of enforcement mechanisms that names all three is structurally distinguishable from a contract statement that declares them co-equal peers. V-01 tests whether the rubric scores C-47 FAIL when the nodes are individually named but the unity framing is absent.

ARCHITECTURE -- Named-Output Pipeline

Pipeline-wide: each per-input annotation must be parseable as a complete
"Required input -- do not re-derive: [label]" statement in isolation -- without
reading adjacent annotations or relying on a shared header for scope.
Grouping is a symptom of failing this standard, not the standard itself.
[C-45 PASS: independence-in-isolation named as positive standard]

Form equivalence for convergence compliance notes: any notation satisfying the
independence property passes -- bracketed group note, per-annotation isolation
comment, or equivalent form are interchangeable. The criterion is the property,
not the specific form.
[C-49 PASS: form equivalence explicitly declared in meta-rule]

Enforcement mechanisms present in this output:
  - Consuming steps carry "Required input -- do not re-derive: [label]" per named input.
  - Terminal producer (STEP E) carries "Required output -- emit exactly: [label]".
  - Convergence points carry inline compliance notes after per-input annotations.
[C-47 FAIL: three enforcement mechanisms listed as separate items -- not declared as
 co-equal peers in a single unified local-verifiability contract statement]

C-46 coverage: 7 multi-input consuming steps in this pipeline
(STEP 3, STEP C CAUSAL GAP, STEP C SEQUENCE, STEP C COHERENCE, STEP C STALENESS,
STEP D, STEP E). After STEP E, emit:
  C-46 coverage: complete -- 7/7 multi-input consuming steps carry inline compliance notes.
[C-48 PASS: pipeline-completeness certification declared as count commitment before analysis]

Two parts in order. Do not merge.
PART 1 -- ANALYTICAL RECORD: internal. Severity, mechanism analysis, ranked flags.
PART 2 -- TEAM COACHING REPORT: advisory observations. No severity labels or scores.

Locked structural features (architectural -- not instructional):
1. Artifact inventory includes "Inertia Relevant?" column (yes / no per artifact).
2. CAUSAL GAP opens with "Inertia-relevant pool: [list]" and evaluates that pool only.
   Empty pool -> verdict absent by default; name what's needed.
   Non-empty pool -> evaluate; state present / partial / absent.
3. CAUSAL GAP ends with [MECHANISM VERDICT: ...]. SEQUENCE quotes it verbatim.
4. SEQUENCE closes with: Pre-specification gap: [YES / NO + reason].
5. PART 2 opens with STEP A: INERTIA CASE STRENGTH as a dedicated named section. STEP A

======================================================================
PART 1 -- ANALYTICAL RECORD  (internal -- not for team use)
======================================================================

==== STEP 0: INERTIA ANCHOR  (~30 words) ====

Before the inventory: what is the team doing today if {{topic}} does not ship?
State the status-quo alternative in one sentence. This is the inertia competitor.

==== STEP 1: ARTIFACT INVENTORY  (~150 words) ====

| Artifact | Namespace | Date | Signal Carried | Inertia Relevant? |
|----------|-----------|------|----------------|-------------------|
(Inertia Relevant: does this artifact speak to the comparison between {{topic}} and
the status-quo alternative -- competitors, benchmarks, usage data, mechanism evidence?
Mark yes / no.)

Empty namespaces (scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic):
  list each -- expected gap or meaningful blind spot?

Inertia-relevant artifact count (from column above):
  1 or more -> staleness threshold = 14 days
  0         -> staleness threshold = 30 days

==== STEP 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS -- CAUSAL GAP FIRST  (~540 words) ====

Analysis order: CAUSAL GAP -> SEQUENCE -> COHERENCE -> STALENESS.
For each: cite artifacts by name, severity internally (not a gate), coaching
observation, one concrete next action if flagged.

### CAUSAL GAP

Inertia-relevant pool: [list every artifact tagged yes in Step 1].
Evaluate mechanism evidence from this pool only.

Inertia anchor: [restate Step 0 in one phrase].

If pool is EMPTY:
  Mechanism verdict is absent by default. State explicitly. Name what artifact types
  would populate the pool. Do not draw on non-pool artifacts.

If pool is NON-EMPTY:
  Is there evidence for the pathway from {{topic}} to its claimed outcome, specifically
  better than the status-quo alternative? State: present / partial / absent.

(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

[MECHANISM VERDICT: present / partial / absent -- key gap if any: ___]
<- SEQUENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]. Quote verbatim.
<- PART 2 STEP A: Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]. Quote verbatim.

### SEQUENCE

Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]
Quoting mechanism verdict: "[MECHANISM VERDICT from above -- paste verbatim]"

Cite 2+ artifacts with dates. Did discovery precede specification?
Read ordering through mechanism lens: did inertia-relevant pool artifacts appear in
the discovery phase, or did the team specify before mechanism evidence existed?
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Pre-specification gap: [YES -- mechanism gap existed before earliest spec artifact /
  NO -- mechanism evidence was present when team committed to spec]
-> STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap. Consume by label.
-> PART 2 STEP C SEQUENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap.

### COHERENCE

Name 2+ signals on a specific claim: aligned / contradicting / inconclusive.
For each contradiction: name the two signals, state the specific disagreement, tag
whether mechanism-relevant.
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Mechanism-relevant contradiction: [YES -- name the contradiction and inertia-pool artifact /
  NO -- no contradiction involves inertia-pool signals]
-> STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction. Consume by label.
-> PART 2 STEP C COHERENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction.

### STALENESS

Apply threshold from Step 1 (14 or 30 days). Inertia-pool artifacts inside / outside window?
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Mechanism-stale: [YES -- name inertia-pool artifact(s) outside threshold /
  NO -- all inertia-pool artifacts within threshold]
-> STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale. Consume by label.
-> PART 2 STEP C STALENESS: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale.

==== STEP 3: CROSS-DIMENSION PATTERN  (~90 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap from SEQUENCE
Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction from COHERENCE
Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale from STALENESS
Pool status: [empty / thin / adequate -- from CAUSAL GAP]
[C-43 PASS: three independent per-input annotations at this 3-input consuming step;
 each annotation is independently parseable without proximity dependency]

From these named outputs:
- Pre-specification gap YES + thin/empty pool -> "Commitment before evidence"
- Mechanism-stale YES + partial verdict -> "Stale mechanism comparison"
- Mechanism-relevant contradiction YES + partial/absent verdict -> "Mechanism contradiction"
- Empty pool -> "Empty inertia pool"
- No shared root -> "Isolated flags" or "none"

Root pattern: [SHORT NAME -- drawn from named outputs; do not describe in prose only]
-> PART 2 STEP B: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern. Reference by label.
-> PART 2 STEP C per-dim: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern.
-> PART 2 STEP D: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern. Reference by label.

======================================================================
PART 2 -- TEAM COACHING REPORT  (advisory -- no severity labels)
======================================================================

==== STEP A: INERTIA CASE STRENGTH  (~100 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]
Quoting mechanism verdict: "[MECHANISM VERDICT from PART 1 -- paste verbatim]"

Based on that verdict and the full artifact record for {{topic}}, is the case
that it beats doing nothing:
  [ ] Clearly built -- mechanism evidence present, status-quo comparison addressed
  [ ] Partially built -- some evidence exists but specific gaps remain; name the key one
  [ ] Still open -- mechanism or comparison not established in the artifact record

State which applies. Advisory -- not a gate.

Inertia case: [BUILT / PARTIAL / OPEN + one-phrase reason]
-> STEP E: Required input -- do not re-derive: Inertia case. Consume by label.

==== STEP B: DRAFT READINESS  (~75 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3

From Part 1: which dimensions look clean, which have something worth noticing?
If Root pattern is not "none" or "Isolated flags": name the Root pattern explicitly
before individual observations -- the team sees the cross-dimension shape first.
Label: [DRAFT -- to be confirmed after STEP D and finalized in STEP E]

==== STEP C: DIMENSION OBSERVATIONS  (~340 words) ====

CAUSAL GAP-first. Advisory. No severity, scores, or gates.
Per-dimension: state Root pattern contribution and close with STEP C drift binary.

CAUSAL GAP: [coaching observation -- pool status; if empty, name artifact types needed;
  if non-empty, note what evidence exists and what is missing]
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3
  [C-43 PASS: one independent per-input annotation at this 1-input step; independence trivially satisfied]
  Root pattern contribution: [CAUSAL GAP contributed to Root pattern: "[label from STEP 3]"
    / CAUSAL GAP is an isolated flag]
  STEP C drift: [CLOSED -- CAUSAL GAP coaching aligns with Root pattern "[label]" /
    OPEN -- CAUSAL GAP coaching diverges; reason: ...]
  If flagged -> suggested next step:

SEQUENCE: [coaching observation]
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap from SEQUENCE
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3
  [C-43 PASS: two independent per-input annotations at this 2-input convergence step;
   each annotation is independently parseable without proximity dependency]
  Root pattern contribution: [SEQUENCE contributed to Root pattern: "[label]"
    / SEQUENCE is an isolated flag]
  STEP C drift: [CLOSED / OPEN + reason]
  If flagged -> suggested next step:

COHERENCE: [coaching observation]
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction from COHERENCE
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3
  [C-43 PASS: two independent per-input annotations at this 2-input convergence step;
   each annotation is independently parseable without proximity dependency]
  Root pattern contribution: [COHERENCE contributed to Root pattern: "[label]"
    / COHERENCE is an isolated flag]
  STEP C drift: [CLOSED / OPEN + reason]
  If flagged -> suggested next step:

STALENESS: [coaching observation]
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale from STALENESS
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3
  [C-43 PASS: two independent per-input annotations at this 2-input convergence step;
   each annotation is independently parseable without proximity dependency]
  Root pattern contribution: [STALENESS contributed to Root pattern: "[label]"
    / STALENESS is an isolated flag]
  STEP C drift: [CLOSED / OPEN + reason]
  If flagged -> suggested next step:

==== STEP D: CONFIRMED READINESS  (~90 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3
Required input -- do not re-derive: STEP C drift -- CAUSAL GAP from PART 2 STEP C
Required input -- do not re-derive: STEP C drift -- SEQUENCE from PART 2 STEP C
Required input -- do not re-derive: STEP C drift -- COHERENCE from PART 2 STEP C
Required input -- do not re-derive: STEP C drift -- STALENESS from PART 2 STEP C
[C-43 PASS: five independent per-input annotations at this 5-input convergence step;
 each annotation is independently parseable without proximity dependency]

Drift summary (consume each from STEP C labels above -- do not re-infer from prose):
  CAUSAL GAP: [CLOSED / OPEN]
  SEQUENCE:   [CLOSED / OPEN]
  COHERENCE:  [CLOSED / OPEN]
  STALENESS:  [CLOSED / OPEN]

If all CLOSED: per-dimension coaching confirmed Root pattern without divergence.
If any OPEN: name dimension(s) and reason for divergence.

Confirmed readiness: [READY -- all drift CLOSED, mechanism evidence sufficient /
  CONDITIONALLY READY -- [list conditions]; one more loop recommended on [dimension] /
  NOT READY -- [dimension] OPEN; mechanism or timing gap must be addressed]
-> STEP E: Required input -- do not re-derive: Confirmed readiness. Consume by label.

==== STEP E: TEAM READINESS POSITION  (~90 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Confirmed readiness from STEP D
Required input -- do not re-derive: Inertia case from STEP A
[C-43 PASS: two independent per-input annotations at this 2-input convergence step;
 each annotation is independently parseable without proximity dependency]

From the two grounded inputs above -- state the team-facing position:

1. Dimensions clean vs. flagged (count)
2. Most useful thing to address before committing
3. Confirmed readiness: [READY / CONDITIONALLY READY / NOT READY]
4. Inertia case: [BUILT / PARTIAL / OPEN]
5. Overall read: proceed / loop once more / investigate further

Required output -- emit exactly:
  Terminal readiness: [PROCEED / LOOP / INVESTIGATE + one-phrase reason] -> topic namespace
[C-44 PASS: forward-declaration arrow inline on verdict line, naming external consumer by identity]

C-46 coverage: complete -- 7/7 multi-input consuming steps carry inline compliance notes
(STEP 3: 3-input, STEP C SEQUENCE: 2-input, STEP C COHERENCE: 2-input,
 STEP C STALENESS: 2-input, STEP D: 5-input, STEP E: 2-input;
 STEP C CAUSAL GAP: 1-input, trivially satisfied).
```

## V-02 — C-48 FAIL: No pipeline-completeness certification

**Axis**: Single — C-48. Meta-rule satisfies C-47 (unified three-node contract) and C-49 (form equivalence). All 7 C-46 compliance notes are present. No "C-46 coverage: complete -- N/N" certification appears anywhere in the output.
**Hypothesis**: C-46 notes present at every convergence step are individually verifiable but not self-certifying as a set. Without the count-assertion, partial coverage and total coverage are structurally indistinguishable to a reader doing a spot-check. V-02 tests whether C-48 is scored independently of C-46: full C-46 compliance should not be enough when no certification exists.

9. PART 2 STEP C each dimension closes with STEP C drift: CLOSED/OPEN. PART 2 STEP D
   opens by consuming all five named inputs by label -- one independently parseable
   per-input annotation each (pipeline-wide independence standard applies at this 5-input step).
10. PART 2 STEP D closes with:
    Confirmed readiness: [READY / CONDITIONALLY READY / NOT READY] -> STEP E (forward arrow).
11. PART 2 STEP E opens with two independently parseable per-input prohibitions, then
    emits Terminal readiness with inline forward arrow -> topic namespace.
NOTE: No pipeline-completeness certification is emitted in this variation (C-48 FAIL by design).

PART 1 -- ANALYTICAL RECORD  (internal -- not for team use)
======================================================================

==== STEP 0: INERTIA ANCHOR  (~30 words) ====

Before the inventory: what is the team doing today if {{topic}} does not ship?
State the status-quo alternative in one sentence. This is the inertia competitor.

==== STEP 1: ARTIFACT INVENTORY  (~150 words) ====

| Artifact | Namespace | Date | Signal Carried | Inertia Relevant? |
|----------|-----------|------|----------------|-------------------|
(Inertia Relevant: does this artifact speak to the comparison between {{topic}} and
the status-quo alternative -- competitors, benchmarks, usage data, mechanism evidence?
Mark yes / no.)

Empty namespaces (scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic):
  list each -- expected gap or meaningful blind spot?

Inertia-relevant artifact count (from column above):
  1 or more -> staleness threshold = 14 days
  0         -> staleness threshold = 30 days

==== STEP 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS -- CAUSAL GAP FIRST  (~540 words) ====

Analysis order: CAUSAL GAP -> SEQUENCE -> COHERENCE -> STALENESS.
For each: cite artifacts by name, severity internally (not a gate), coaching
observation, one concrete next action if flagged.

### CAUSAL GAP

Inertia-relevant pool: [list every artifact tagged yes in Step 1].
Evaluate mechanism evidence from this pool only.

Inertia anchor: [restate Step 0 in one phrase].

If pool is EMPTY:
  Mechanism verdict is absent by default. State explicitly. Name what artifact types
  would populate the pool. Do not draw on non-pool artifacts.

If pool is NON-EMPTY:
  Is there evidence for the pathway from {{topic}} to its claimed outcome, specifically
  better than the status-quo alternative? State: present / partial / absent.

(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

[MECHANISM VERDICT: present / partial / absent -- key gap if any: ___]
<- SEQUENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]. Quote verbatim.
<- PART 2 STEP A: Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]. Quote verbatim.

### SEQUENCE

Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]
Quoting mechanism verdict: "[MECHANISM VERDICT from above -- paste verbatim]"

Cite 2+ artifacts with dates. Did discovery precede specification?
Read ordering through mechanism lens: did inertia-relevant pool artifacts appear in
the discovery phase, or did the team specify before mechanism evidence existed?
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Pre-specification gap: [YES -- mechanism gap existed before earliest spec artifact /
  NO -- mechanism evidence was present when team committed to spec]
-> STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap. Consume by label.
-> PART 2 STEP C SEQUENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap.

### COHERENCE

Name 2+ signals on a specific claim: aligned / contradicting / inconclusive.
For each contradiction: name the two signals, state the specific disagreement, tag
whether mechanism-relevant.
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Mechanism-relevant contradiction: [YES -- name the contradiction and inertia-pool artifact /
  NO -- no contradiction involves inertia-pool signals]
-> STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction. Consume by label.
-> PART 2 STEP C COHERENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction.

### STALENESS

Apply threshold from Step 1 (14 or 30 days). Inertia-pool artifacts inside / outside window?
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Mechanism-stale: [YES -- name inertia-pool artifact(s) outside threshold /
  NO -- all inertia-pool artifacts within threshold]
-> STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale. Consume by label.
-> PART 2 STEP C STALENESS: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale.

==== STEP 3: CROSS-DIMENSION PATTERN  (~90 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap from SEQUENCE
Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction from COHERENCE
Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale from STALENESS
Pool status: [empty / thin / adequate -- from CAUSAL GAP]
[C-43 PASS: three independent per-input annotations at this 3-input consuming step;
 each annotation is independently parseable without proximity dependency]

From these named outputs:
- Pre-specification gap YES + thin/empty pool -> "Commitment before evidence"
- Mechanism-stale YES + partial verdict -> "Stale mechanism comparison"
- Mechanism-relevant contradiction YES + partial/absent verdict -> "Mechanism contradiction"
- Empty pool -> "Empty inertia pool"
- No shared root -> "Isolated flags" or "none"

Root pattern: [SHORT NAME -- drawn from named outputs; do not describe in prose only]
-> PART 2 STEP B: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern. Reference by label.
-> PART 2 STEP C per-dim: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern.
-> PART 2 STEP D: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern. Reference by label.

==== STEP A: INERTIA CASE STRENGTH  (~100 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]
Quoting mechanism verdict: "[MECHANISM VERDICT from PART 1 -- paste verbatim]"

Based on that verdict and the full artifact record for {{topic}}, is the case
that it beats doing nothing:
  [ ] Clearly built -- mechanism evidence present, status-quo comparison addressed
  [ ] Partially built -- some evidence exists but specific gaps remain; name the key one
  [ ] Still open -- mechanism or comparison not established in the artifact record

State which applies. Advisory -- not a gate.

Inertia case: [BUILT / PARTIAL / OPEN + one-phrase reason]
-> STEP E: Required input -- do not re-derive: Inertia case. Consume by label.

==== STEP B: DRAFT READINESS  (~75 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3

From Part 1: which dimensions look clean, which have something worth noticing?
If Root pattern is not "none" or "Isolated flags": name the Root pattern explicitly
before individual observations -- the team sees the cross-dimension shape first.
Label: [DRAFT -- to be confirmed after STEP D and finalized in STEP E]

==== STEP C: DIMENSION OBSERVATIONS  (~340 words) ====

CAUSAL GAP-first. Advisory. No severity, scores, or gates.
Per-dimension: state Root pattern contribution and close with STEP C drift binary.

CAUSAL GAP: [coaching observation -- pool status; if empty, name artifact types needed;
  if non-empty, note what evidence exists and what is missing]

  CAUSAL GAP: [CLOSED / OPEN]
  SEQUENCE:   [CLOSED / OPEN]
  COHERENCE:  [CLOSED / OPEN]
  STALENESS:  [CLOSED / OPEN]

If all CLOSED: per-dimension coaching confirmed Root pattern without divergence.
If any OPEN: name dimension(s) and reason for divergence.

Confirmed readiness: [READY -- all drift CLOSED, mechanism evidence sufficient /
  CONDITIONALLY READY -- [list conditions]; one more loop recommended on [dimension] /
  NOT READY -- [dimension] OPEN; mechanism or timing gap must be addressed]
-> STEP E: Required input -- do not re-derive: Confirmed readiness. Consume by label.

## V-03 — C-49 FAIL: Specific notation required, form equivalence not declared

**Axis**: Single — C-49. Meta-rule satisfies C-47 (unified three-node contract) and C-48 (certification present) but declares a specific required notation for convergence compliance notes (bracket form) without stating that equivalent forms also pass. All 7 C-46 compliance notes use the mandated bracket form.
**Hypothesis**: C-49 requires the meta-rule to pre-declare that any notation satisfying independence passes, preventing false failures on future variation outputs that use a different but valid form. When the meta-rule mandates a specific form without equivalence, the rubric should score C-49 FAIL even when C-46 is perfectly executed with the mandated form.

```markdown
Signal-check for {{topic}}.
Advisory -- observations the team can decide to act on, not a gate.

ARCHITECTURE -- Named-Output Pipeline

Pipeline-wide: each per-input annotation must be parseable as a complete
"Required input -- do not re-derive: [label]" statement in isolation -- without
reading adjacent annotations or relying on a shared header for scope.
Grouping is a symptom of failing this standard, not the standard itself.
[C-45 PASS: independence-in-isolation named as positive standard]

Convergence compliance notation: each multi-input consuming step must carry a
bracketed compliance note in exactly this form:
  [C-43 PASS: N independent per-input annotations at this N-input convergence step]
immediately after its per-input prohibitions.
[C-49 FAIL: bracket notation mandated as required form -- form equivalence not declared;
 outputs using per-annotation isolation comments or other valid forms would score C-46 FAIL
 under this meta-rule, creating a false-fail risk for valid alternative notations]

Local-verifiability contract -- three enforcement nodes as co-equal self-declaration peers:
  (1) Consuming steps: "Required input -- do not re-derive: [label]" per named input (C-26)
  (2) Terminal producer (STEP E): "Required output -- emit exactly: [label]" (C-39)
  (3) Convergence points: inline bracketed compliance note [C-43 PASS: N...] (C-46)
Each node class self-declares its obligation locally; no cross-referencing needed.
[C-47 PASS: three enforcement nodes declared as unified co-equal local-verifiability contract]

C-46 coverage: 7 multi-input consuming steps in this pipeline
(STEP 3, STEP C CAUSAL GAP, STEP C SEQUENCE, STEP C COHERENCE, STEP C STALENESS,
STEP D, STEP E). After STEP E, emit:
  C-46 coverage: complete -- 7/7 multi-input consuming steps carry inline compliance notes.
[C-48 PASS: pipeline-completeness certification declared as count commitment before analysis]

Two parts in order. Do not merge.
PART 1 -- ANALYTICAL RECORD: internal. Severity, mechanism analysis, ranked flags.
PART 2 -- TEAM COACHING REPORT: advisory observations. No severity labels or scores.

Locked structural features (architectural -- not instructional):
1. Artifact inventory includes "Inertia Relevant?" column (yes / no per artifact).
2. CAUSAL GAP opens with "Inertia-relevant pool: [list]" and evaluates that pool only.
   Empty pool -> verdict absent by default; name what's needed.
   Non-empty pool -> evaluate; state present / partial / absent.
3. CAUSAL GAP ends with [MECHANISM VERDICT: ...]. SEQUENCE quotes it verbatim.
4. SEQUENCE closes with: Pre-specification gap: [YES / NO + reason].
5. PART 2 opens with STEP A: INERTIA CASE STRENGTH as a dedicated named section. STEP A
   opens by quoting the MECHANISM VERDICT verbatim and closes with:
   Inertia case: [BUILT / PARTIAL / OPEN + reason] -> STEP E (forward arrow).
6. COHERENCE closes with: Mechanism-relevant contradiction: [YES / NO + reason].
7. STALENESS closes with: Mechanism-stale: [YES / NO + reason].
8. STEP 3 closes with: Root pattern: [SHORT NAME].
9. PART 2 STEP C each dimension closes with STEP C drift: CLOSED/OPEN. PART 2 STEP D
   opens by consuming all five named inputs by label -- one independently parseable
   per-input annotation each (pipeline-wide independence standard applies at this 5-input step).
10. PART 2 STEP D closes with:
    Confirmed readiness: [READY / CONDITIONALLY READY / NOT READY] -> STEP E (forward arrow).
11. PART 2 STEP E opens with two independently parseable per-input prohibitions, then
    emits Terminal readiness with inline forward arrow -> topic namespace.
12. After STEP E, emit: C-46 coverage: complete -- 7/7 multi-input consuming steps carry
    inline compliance notes (STEP 3, STEP C x4 dimensions, STEP D, STEP E).

**Axes**: C-47 PASS (three-node unified contract declared as co-equal peers), C-48 PASS (count commitment pre-declared + post-analysis certification), C-49 PASS (form equivalence explicitly declared). C-46 compliance notes use Form A bracketed group notation throughout.
**Hypothesis**: Explicit declaration of the three-node contract as a unified system, pre-declared count commitment plus final certification, and form equivalence statement together satisfy all three new v6 criteria. This variation is the clean reference for R6 A+ performance using bracket-form convergence notes.

ARCHITECTURE -- Named-Output Pipeline

Pipeline-wide: each per-input annotation must be parseable as a complete
"Required input -- do not re-derive: [label]" statement in isolation -- without
reading adjacent annotations or relying on a shared header for scope.
Grouping is a symptom of failing this standard, not the standard itself.
[C-45 PASS: independence-in-isolation named as positive standard]

Form equivalence for convergence compliance notes: any notation satisfying the
independence property passes -- bracketed group note, per-annotation isolation
comment, numbered annotation set, or equivalent form are interchangeable.
The criterion is the property (independence / parseable completeness), not the
specific notation.
[C-49 PASS: form equivalence explicitly declared; criterion is property-level,
 notation is interchangeable]

Local-verifiability contract -- three enforcement nodes as co-equal self-declaration peers:
  (1) Consuming steps: "Required input -- do not re-derive: [label]" per named input (C-26)
  (2) Terminal producer (STEP E): "Required output -- emit exactly: [label]" (C-39)
  (3) Convergence points: inline compliance note after N per-input annotations (C-46)
Together these ensure every pipeline obligation is locally self-declared without
cross-referencing the ARCHITECTURE block or any other step.
[C-47 PASS: three enforcement nodes (C-26 consumers, C-39 terminal producer,
 C-46 convergence points) declared as co-equal unified local-verifiability contract]

C-46 coverage commitment: 7 multi-input consuming steps in this pipeline
(STEP 3: 3-input, STEP C CAUSAL GAP: 1-input trivially satisfied,
 STEP C SEQUENCE: 2-input, STEP C COHERENCE: 2-input, STEP C STALENESS: 2-input,

======================================================================
PART 1 -- ANALYTICAL RECORD  (internal -- not for team use)
======================================================================

==== STEP 0: INERTIA ANCHOR  (~30 words) ====

Before the inventory: what is the team doing today if {{topic}} does not ship?
State the status-quo alternative in one sentence. This is the inertia competitor.

==== STEP 1: ARTIFACT INVENTORY  (~150 words) ====

| Artifact | Namespace | Date | Signal Carried | Inertia Relevant? |
|----------|-----------|------|----------------|-------------------|
(Inertia Relevant: does this artifact speak to the comparison between {{topic}} and
the status-quo alternative -- competitors, benchmarks, usage data, mechanism evidence?
Mark yes / no.)

Empty namespaces (scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic):
  list each -- expected gap or meaningful blind spot?

Inertia-relevant artifact count (from column above):
  1 or more -> staleness threshold = 14 days
  0         -> staleness threshold = 30 days

==== STEP 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS -- CAUSAL GAP FIRST  (~540 words) ====

Analysis order: CAUSAL GAP -> SEQUENCE -> COHERENCE -> STALENESS.
For each: cite artifacts by name, severity internally (not a gate), coaching
observation, one concrete next action if flagged.

### CAUSAL GAP

Inertia-relevant pool: [list every artifact tagged yes in Step 1].
Evaluate mechanism evidence from this pool only.

Inertia anchor: [restate Step 0 in one phrase].

If pool is EMPTY:
  Mechanism verdict is absent by default. State explicitly. Name what artifact types
  would populate the pool. Do not draw on non-pool artifacts.

If pool is NON-EMPTY:
  Is there evidence for the pathway from {{topic}} to its claimed outcome, specifically
  better than the status-quo alternative? State: present / partial / absent.

(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

[MECHANISM VERDICT: present / partial / absent -- key gap if any: ___]
<- SEQUENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]. Quote verbatim.
<- PART 2 STEP A: Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]. Quote verbatim.

### SEQUENCE

Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]
Quoting mechanism verdict: "[MECHANISM VERDICT from above -- paste verbatim]"

Cite 2+ artifacts with dates. Did discovery precede specification?
Read ordering through mechanism lens: did inertia-relevant pool artifacts appear in
the discovery phase, or did the team specify before mechanism evidence existed?
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Pre-specification gap: [YES -- mechanism gap existed before earliest spec artifact /
  NO -- mechanism evidence was present when team committed to spec]
-> STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap. Consume by label.
-> PART 2 STEP C SEQUENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap.

### COHERENCE

Name 2+ signals on a specific claim: aligned / contradicting / inconclusive.
For each contradiction: name the two signals, state the specific disagreement, tag
whether mechanism-relevant.
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Mechanism-relevant contradiction: [YES -- name the contradiction and inertia-pool artifact /
  NO -- no contradiction involves inertia-pool signals]
-> STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction. Consume by label.
-> PART 2 STEP C COHERENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction.

### STALENESS

Apply threshold from Step 1 (14 or 30 days). Inertia-pool artifacts inside / outside window?
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Mechanism-stale: [YES -- name inertia-pool artifact(s) outside threshold /
  NO -- all inertia-pool artifacts within threshold]
-> STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale. Consume by label.
-> PART 2 STEP C STALENESS: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale.

==== STEP 3: CROSS-DIMENSION PATTERN  (~90 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap from SEQUENCE
Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction from COHERENCE
Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale from STALENESS
Pool status: [empty / thin / adequate -- from CAUSAL GAP]
[C-43 PASS: three independent per-input annotations at this 3-input consuming step;
 each annotation is independently parseable without proximity dependency]

From these named outputs:
- Pre-specification gap YES + thin/empty pool -> "Commitment before evidence"
- Mechanism-stale YES + partial verdict -> "Stale mechanism comparison"
- Mechanism-relevant contradiction YES + partial/absent verdict -> "Mechanism contradiction"
- Empty pool -> "Empty inertia pool"
- No shared root -> "Isolated flags" or "none"

Root pattern: [SHORT NAME -- drawn from named outputs; do not describe in prose only]
-> PART 2 STEP B: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern. Reference by label.
-> PART 2 STEP C per-dim: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern.
-> PART 2 STEP D: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern. Reference by label.

======================================================================
PART 2 -- TEAM COACHING REPORT  (advisory -- no severity labels)
======================================================================

==== STEP A: INERTIA CASE STRENGTH  (~100 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]
Quoting mechanism verdict: "[MECHANISM VERDICT from PART 1 -- paste verbatim]"

Based on that verdict and the full artifact record for {{topic}}, is the case
that it beats doing nothing:
  [ ] Clearly built -- mechanism evidence present, status-quo comparison addressed
  [ ] Partially built -- some evidence exists but specific gaps remain; name the key one
  [ ] Still open -- mechanism or comparison not established in the artifact record

State which applies. Advisory -- not a gate.

Inertia case: [BUILT / PARTIAL / OPEN + one-phrase reason]
-> STEP E: Required input -- do not re-derive: Inertia case. Consume by label.

==== STEP B: DRAFT READINESS  (~75 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3

From Part 1: which dimensions look clean, which have something worth noticing?
If Root pattern is not "none" or "Isolated flags": name the Root pattern explicitly
before individual observations -- the team sees the cross-dimension shape first.
Label: [DRAFT -- to be confirmed after STEP D and finalized in STEP E]

==== STEP C: DIMENSION OBSERVATIONS  (~340 words) ====

CAUSAL GAP-first. Advisory. No severity, scores, or gates.
Per-dimension: state Root pattern contribution and close with STEP C drift binary.

CAUSAL GAP: [coaching observation -- pool status; if empty, name artifact types needed;
  if non-empty, note what evidence exists and what is missing]

## V-05 — Combined: All three PASS, Form B (per-annotation isolation comments)

**Axes**: C-47 PASS (three-node system declared with alternative phrasing), C-48 PASS (certification present), C-49 PASS (form equivalence declared, independence as governing property). C-46 compliance notes use Form B: per-annotation isolation comments plus a trailing summary count.
**Hypothesis**: C-47 is property-level -- "three-node self-declaration system" satisfies the criterion equivalently to "unified local-verifiability contract." C-49 is property-level -- declaring independence as the criterion with form as interchangeable satisfies it regardless of exact phrasing. Form B C-46 notes satisfy C-46 equivalently to Form A when C-49 is declared. Expected 41/41, confirming all three new criteria are property-level.

ARCHITECTURE -- Named-Output Pipeline

Annotation independence is the governing standard for this pipeline: each
annotation must stand alone as a complete parseable statement without borrowing
meaning from adjacent annotations.
  - At consuming steps: "Required input -- do not re-derive: [label]" -- each input
    independently.
  - At the terminal producer (STEP E): "Required output -- emit exactly: [label]".
  - At convergence points: inline compliance self-declaration after per-input annotations.
These three annotation classes are co-equal -- together they make every pipeline
obligation locally visible without a global audit.
[C-45 PASS: independence-in-isolation as governing standard, named affirmatively]
[C-47 PASS: three-node self-declaration system (consuming steps, terminal producer,
 convergence points) declared as co-equal unified enforcement peers]

Convergence note form: any self-declaration satisfying the independence property
passes. Isolation-framing comments (e.g., "each annotation stands alone"),
bracketed counts, numbered sets, or other equivalent forms are interchangeable.
The independence property is the criterion; the specific form is not.
[C-49 PASS: form equivalence declared; independence is the criterion,
 form is interchangeable -- notation-specific requirements are not imposed]

Pipeline-completeness: 7 convergence points in this pipeline. Emit after STEP E:
  C-46 coverage: complete -- 7/7 convergence points carry compliance notes.
[C-48 PASS: pipeline-completeness certification declared as pre-analysis count commitment]

   Empty pool -> verdict absent by default; name what's needed.
   Non-empty pool -> evaluate; state present / partial / absent.
3. CAUSAL GAP ends with [MECHANISM VERDICT: ...]. SEQUENCE quotes it verbatim.
4. SEQUENCE closes with: Pre-specification gap: [YES / NO + reason].
5. PART 2 opens with STEP A: INERTIA CASE STRENGTH as a dedicated named section. STEP A
   opens by quoting the MECHANISM VERDICT verbatim and closes with:
   Inertia case: [BUILT / PARTIAL / OPEN + reason] -> STEP E (forward arrow).
6. COHERENCE closes with: Mechanism-relevant contradiction: [YES / NO + reason].
7. STALENESS closes with: Mechanism-stale: [YES / NO + reason].
8. STEP 3 closes with: Root pattern: [SHORT NAME].
9. PART 2 STEP C each dimension closes with STEP C drift: CLOSED/OPEN. PART 2 STEP D
   opens by consuming all five named inputs by label -- one independently parseable
   per-input annotation each (pipeline-wide independence standard applies at this 5-input step).
10. PART 2 STEP D closes with:
    Confirmed readiness: [READY / CONDITIONALLY READY / NOT READY] -> STEP E (forward arrow).
11. PART 2 STEP E opens with two independently parseable per-input prohibitions, then
    emits Terminal readiness with inline forward arrow -> topic namespace.
12. After STEP E, emit: C-46 coverage: complete -- 7/7 convergence points carry compliance

======================================================================
PART 1 -- ANALYTICAL RECORD  (internal -- not for team use)
======================================================================

==== STEP 0: INERTIA ANCHOR  (~30 words) ====

Before the inventory: what is the team doing today if {{topic}} does not ship?
State the status-quo alternative in one sentence. This is the inertia competitor.

==== STEP 1: ARTIFACT INVENTORY  (~150 words) ====

| Artifact | Namespace | Date | Signal Carried | Inertia Relevant? |
|----------|-----------|------|----------------|-------------------|
(Inertia Relevant: does this artifact speak to the comparison between {{topic}} and
the status-quo alternative -- competitors, benchmarks, usage data, mechanism evidence?
Mark yes / no.)

Empty namespaces (scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic):
  list each -- expected gap or meaningful blind spot?

Inertia-relevant artifact count (from column above):
  1 or more -> staleness threshold = 14 days
  0         -> staleness threshold = 30 days

==== STEP 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS -- CAUSAL GAP FIRST  (~540 words) ====

Analysis order: CAUSAL GAP -> SEQUENCE -> COHERENCE -> STALENESS.
For each: cite artifacts by name, severity internally (not a gate), coaching
observation, one concrete next action if flagged.

### CAUSAL GAP

Inertia-relevant pool: [list every artifact tagged yes in Step 1].
Evaluate mechanism evidence from this pool only.

Inertia anchor: [restate Step 0 in one phrase].

If pool is EMPTY:
  Mechanism verdict is absent by default. State explicitly. Name what artifact types
  would populate the pool. Do not draw on non-pool artifacts.

If pool is NON-EMPTY:
  Is there evidence for the pathway from {{topic}} to its claimed outcome, specifically
  better than the status-quo alternative? State: present / partial / absent.

(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

[MECHANISM VERDICT: present / partial / absent -- key gap if any: ___]
<- SEQUENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]. Quote verbatim.
<- PART 2 STEP A: Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]. Quote verbatim.

### SEQUENCE

Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]
  (annotation stands alone: readable in isolation)
Quoting mechanism verdict: "[MECHANISM VERDICT from above -- paste verbatim]"

Cite 2+ artifacts with dates. Did discovery precede specification?
Read ordering through mechanism lens: did inertia-relevant pool artifacts appear in
the discovery phase, or did the team specify before mechanism evidence existed?
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Pre-specification gap: [YES -- mechanism gap existed before earliest spec artifact /
  NO -- mechanism evidence was present when team committed to spec]
-> STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap. Consume by label.
-> PART 2 STEP C SEQUENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap.

### COHERENCE

Name 2+ signals on a specific claim: aligned / contradicting / inconclusive.
For each contradiction: name the two signals, state the specific disagreement, tag
whether mechanism-relevant.
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Mechanism-relevant contradiction: [YES -- name the contradiction and inertia-pool artifact /
  NO -- no contradiction involves inertia-pool signals]
-> STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction. Consume by label.
-> PART 2 STEP C COHERENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction.

### STALENESS

Apply threshold from Step 1 (14 or 30 days). Inertia-pool artifacts inside / outside window?
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Mechanism-stale: [YES -- name inertia-pool artifact(s) outside threshold /
  NO -- all inertia-pool artifacts within threshold]
-> STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale. Consume by label.
-> PART 2 STEP C STALENESS: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale.

==== STEP 3: CROSS-DIMENSION PATTERN  (~90 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap from SEQUENCE
  (annotation stands alone: readable in isolation without adjacent annotations)
Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction from COHERENCE
  (annotation stands alone: readable in isolation without adjacent annotations)
Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale from STALENESS
  (annotation stands alone: readable in isolation without adjacent annotations)
Pool status: [empty / thin / adequate -- from CAUSAL GAP]
[3 annotations above; each stands alone -- independence property satisfied at this 3-input step]

From these named outputs:
- Pre-specification gap YES + thin/empty pool -> "Commitment before evidence"
- Mechanism-stale YES + partial verdict -> "Stale mechanism comparison"
- Mechanism-relevant contradiction YES + partial/absent verdict -> "Mechanism contradiction"
- Empty pool -> "Empty inertia pool"
- No shared root -> "Isolated flags" or "none"

Root pattern: [SHORT NAME -- drawn from named outputs; do not describe in prose only]
-> PART 2 STEP B: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern. Reference by label.
-> PART 2 STEP C per-dim: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern.
-> PART 2 STEP D: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern. Reference by label.

======================================================================
PART 2 -- TEAM COACHING REPORT  (advisory -- no severity labels)
======================================================================

==== STEP A: INERTIA CASE STRENGTH  (~100 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]
Quoting mechanism verdict: "[MECHANISM VERDICT from PART 1 -- paste verbatim]"

Based on that verdict and the full artifact record for {{topic}}, is the case
that it beats doing nothing:
  [ ] Clearly built -- mechanism evidence present, status-quo comparison addressed
  [ ] Partially built -- some evidence exists but specific gaps remain; name the key one
  [ ] Still open -- mechanism or comparison not established in the artifact record

State which applies. Advisory -- not a gate.

Inertia case: [BUILT / PARTIAL / OPEN + one-phrase reason]
-> STEP E: Required input -- do not re-derive: Inertia case. Consume by label.

==== STEP B: DRAFT READINESS  (~75 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3

From Part 1: which dimensions look clean, which have something worth noticing?
If Root pattern is not "none" or "Isolated flags": name the Root pattern explicitly
before individual observations -- the team sees the cross-dimension shape first.
Label: [DRAFT -- to be confirmed after STEP D and finalized in STEP E]

==== STEP C: DIMENSION OBSERVATIONS  (~340 words) ====

CAUSAL GAP-first. Advisory. No severity, scores, or gates.
Per-dimension: state Root pattern contribution and close with STEP C drift binary.

CAUSAL GAP: [coaching observation -- pool status; if empty, name artifact types needed;
  if non-empty, note what evidence exists and what is missing]
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3
    (annotation stands alone: readable in isolation -- trivially satisfied at 1 input)
  Root pattern contribution: [CAUSAL GAP contributed to Root pattern: "[label from STEP 3]"
    / CAUSAL GAP is an isolated flag]
  STEP C drift: [CLOSED -- CAUSAL GAP coaching aligns with Root pattern "[label]" /
    OPEN -- CAUSAL GAP coaching diverges; reason: ...]
  If flagged -> suggested next step:

SEQUENCE: [coaching observation]
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap from SEQUENCE
    (annotation stands alone: readable in isolation without the Root pattern annotation)
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3
    (annotation stands alone: readable in isolation without the Pre-specification gap annotation)
  [2 annotations above; each stands alone -- independence property satisfied at this 2-input step]
  Root pattern contribution: [SEQUENCE contributed to Root pattern: "[label]"
    / SEQUENCE is an isolated flag]
  STEP C drift: [CLOSED / OPEN + reason]
  If flagged -> suggested next step:

COHERENCE: [coaching observation]
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction from COHERENCE
    (annotation stands alone: readable in isolation without the Root pattern annotation)
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3
    (annotation stands alone: readable in isolation without the Mechanism-relevant contradiction annotation)
  [2 annotations above; each stands alone -- independence property satisfied at this 2-input step]
  Root pattern contribution: [COHERENCE contributed to Root pattern: "[label]"
    / COHERENCE is an isolated flag]
  STEP C drift: [CLOSED / OPEN + reason]
  If flagged -> suggested next step:

STALENESS: [coaching observation]
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale from STALENESS
    (annotation stands alone: readable in isolation without the Root pattern annotation)
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3
    (annotation stands alone: readable in isolation without the Mechanism-stale annotation)
  [2 annotations above; each stands alone -- independence property satisfied at this 2-input step]
  Root pattern contribution: [STALENESS contributed to Root pattern: "[label]"
    / STALENESS is an isolated flag]
  STEP C drift: [CLOSED / OPEN + reason]
  If flagged -> suggested next step:

==== STEP D: CONFIRMED READINESS  (~90 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3
  (annotation stands alone: readable in isolation)
Required input -- do not re-derive: STEP C drift -- CAUSAL GAP from PART 2 STEP C
  (annotation stands alone: readable in isolation)

  (annotation stands alone: readable in isolation)
Required input -- do not re-derive: STEP C drift -- STALENESS from PART 2 STEP C
  (annotation stands alone: readable in isolation)
[5 annotations above; each stands alone -- independence property satisfied at this 5-input step]

Drift summary (consume each from STEP C labels above -- do not re-infer from prose):
  CAUSAL GAP: [CLOSED / OPEN]
  SEQUENCE:   [CLOSED / OPEN]
  COHERENCE:  [CLOSED / OPEN]
  STALENESS:  [CLOSED / OPEN]

If all CLOSED: per-dimension coaching confirmed Root pattern without divergence.
If any OPEN: name dimension(s) and reason for divergence.

Confirmed readiness: [READY -- all drift CLOSED, mechanism evidence sufficient /
  CONDITIONALLY READY -- [list conditions]; one more loop recommended on [dimension] /
  NOT READY -- [dimension] OPEN; mechanism or timing gap must be addressed]
-> STEP E: Required input -- do not re-derive: Confirmed readiness. Consume by label.

==== STEP E: TEAM READINESS POSITION  (~90 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Confirmed readiness from STEP D
  (annotation stands alone: readable in isolation without the Inertia case annotation)
Required input -- do not re-derive: Inertia case from STEP A
  (annotation stands alone: readable in isolation without the Confirmed readiness annotation)
[2 annotations above; each stands alone -- independence property satisfied at this 2-input step]

From the two grounded inputs above -- state the team-facing position:

1. Dimensions clean vs. flagged (count)
2. Most useful thing to address before committing
3. Confirmed readiness: [READY / CONDITIONALLY READY / NOT READY]
4. Inertia case: [BUILT / PARTIAL / OPEN]
5. Overall read: proceed / loop once more / investigate further

Required output -- emit exactly:
  Terminal readiness: [PROCEED / LOOP / INVESTIGATE + one-phrase reason] -> topic namespace
[C-44 PASS: forward-declaration arrow inline on verdict line, naming external consumer by identity]
