**Round 15 — 5 variations, 3 single-axis + 2 compound**

| | Target | Axis | Composite | New pattern |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **V-01** | C-04 FAIL isolated | Lifecycle emphasis | 88.000 | Fourth C-38 confirmation — ARCHITECT Do-nothing column absent = 88.000, closing the essential-tier isolation profile |
| **V-02** | C-33 FAIL + C-09 PASS at /38 | Output format | 99.737 | V-02 rubric floor empirical at /38; C-43 independence confirmed at new denominator (99.730 → 99.737) |
| **V-03** | C-05 cascade at /38 | Inertia framing | 77.737 | V-09 rubric floor empirical at /38; C-46 mechanism + C-23 formula 78 - 10/38 = 77.737 |
| **V-04** | C-04 FAIL + C-33 FAIL + C-09 PASS | Output format + Lifecycle compound | 87.737 | New essential + aspirational compound floor: -12 + -0.263 = 87.737 |
| **V-05** | C-01 FAIL + C-04 FAIL | Role sequence + Lifecycle compound | 76.000 | C-44 cross-criterion two-essential symmetry: C-01+C-04 = same as C-01+C-03 |

**Key design decisions:**

- **V-01** removes only the Do-nothing cost column from ARCHITECT (column header + all row entries + the directive line). Everything else is golden. This is the cleanest possible C-38 isolation for C-04.

- **V-02** replaces the Item A 4-row table with a prose paragraph that explicitly names INERTIA and VERDICT as coverage sections. The Formula Contract Check is rewritten against the prose (CONDITION i checks that the prose names 2+ sections). C-33 FAIL because no table; C-09 PASS because prose covers 2 sections — the C-43 mechanism at /38.

- **V-03** is mechanically identical to V-02 R14 (the C-05 cascade body). The denominator shift from /37 to /38 happens in the rubric, not the prompt. Reusing the exact mechanism confirms the C-23 formula and C-46 are denominator-independent in their mechanism.

- **V-04** compounds V-01 and V-02: prose Item A (C-33 FAIL) + no Do-nothing column (C-04 FAIL). Focus active. C-09 PASS via prose >= 2 sections. Expected: strictly additive (-12 essential + -0.263 aspirational = 87.737). This tests whether C-38 × C-43 cross-pattern independence holds.

- **V-05** compounds Team/Timeline absence (C-01 FAIL) with Do-nothing column absence (C-04 FAIL). No focus. Anchor minimum unchanged at "at least two of these three." Predicts 76.000 by C-44 — confirms the two-essential floor holds for this previously untested pairing.
: INERTIA cost cell uses [base_cost] unconditionally; INERTIA Baseline uses base_cost; ARCHITECT directive says "use base_cost for all rows"; ARCHITECT Do-nothing cost cell uses [base_cost] unconditionally; VERDICT "Not building this means:" uses base_cost; AMENDMENTS omits focus_adjustment_eliminated block entirely. C-05 FAIL (focus_adjusted_total absent from INERTIA + VERDICT + AMENDMENTS downstream). Cascade per C-23: C-07 FAIL (focus not demonstrably visible in base analysis), C-09 FAIL (focus_adjusted_total in 0 downstream sections). C-46 conditions met: C-33 PASS (table structurally intact in Step 0) + C-09 FAIL (downstream stripped) under C-05 FAIL. Composite at /38: 4/5x60 + 2/3x30 + 37/38x10 = 48 + 20 + 9.737 = 77.737. Empirically confirms V-09 floor at /38 and C-23 formula 78 - 10/38 = 77.737.

**V-04 mechanism (C-04 FAIL + C-33 FAIL + C-09 PASS, focus active):** Compound of V-01 and V-02 mechanisms. Focus active. Step 0 Item A: prose (not table), covering INERTIA + VERDICT with focus_adjusted_total (C-33 FAIL; C-09 PASS via C-43). Items B-D intact. C-05 PASS (focus_adjusted_total computed and propagated). C-46 N/A (C-05 PASS). ARCHITECT: Do-nothing cost column removed (C-04 FAIL). All recommended PASS. C-01 PASS (Team+Timeline present). C-02 PASS (BUDGET intact). C-03 PASS (anchor >= 2). Composite: 4/5x60 + 3/3x30 + 37/38x10 = 48 + 30 + 9.737 = 87.737. New compound floor: essential FAIL (-12) + isolated aspirational FAIL (-10/38 = -0.263) = -12.263 from 100. Tests whether C-38 and C-43 additivity holds across the essential-aspirational boundary.

**V-05 mechanism (C-01 FAIL + C-04 FAIL):** Two simultaneous essential FAILs, different pairing from C-44's confirmed case (C-01+C-03 R13 V-04). (1) INFERENCE GATE: Team and Timeline lines removed entirely. Feature and Named incumbent retained. C-01 FAIL. (2) ARCHITECT: Do-nothing cost column removed entirely. Column header absent, no per-row entry, directive absent from ARCHITECT heading. C-04 FAIL. No focus: C-05 N/A, C-07 N/A, C-09 N/A, C-33 N/A, C-46 N/A. C-02 PASS (PM:BUDGET unchanged). C-03 PASS (anchor minimum unchanged: "at least two of these three anchors are required"). STRATEGY present: C-08 PASS. All recommended PASS. Composite: 3/5x60 + 3/3x30 + 38/38x10 = 36 + 30 + 10 = 76.000. Confirms C-44 cross-criterion symmetry: C-01+C-04 = 76.000, same as C-01+C-03. Two-essential-FAIL additivity holds regardless of which pair is chosen.

### Floor derivations under v13 (denominator /38)

| Variation | Definition | Formula | Composite | Golden? |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| V-01 | C-04 FAIL isolated | 4/5x60 + 3/3x30 + 38/38x10 | 88.000 | No (essential FAIL gate) |

## V-01 -- Lifecycle Emphasis: ARCHITECT Do-nothing Cost Column Absent (C-04 FAIL)

**Axis**: Single-axis. Lifecycle emphasis -- ARCHITECT table present but Do-nothing cost column removed entirely. Column header absent, no per-row entry, column directive removed from ARCHITECT heading. C-04 requires the Do-nothing cost column with explicit values on every row; column absence = C-04 FAIL. All other sections unchanged from golden. Focus inactive.

**Hypothesis**: C-04 FAIL (essential). All other essential PASS. All recommended PASS. All aspirational PASS/N/A. Composite: `4/5x60 + 3/3x30 + 38/38x10 = 48 + 30 + 10 = 88.000`. Not golden (essential FAIL gate). Fourth direct confirmation of C-38 criterion-neutrality: C-04 FAIL = C-03 FAIL (R12) = C-01 FAIL (R13) = C-02 FAIL (R14) = 88.000. Closes essential-tier per-criterion isolation profile (C-05 cannot be isolated due to cascade).

**Changed from golden**: ARCHITECT heading -- "Do-nothing cost column required on every row -- use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C where applicable." removed. ARCHITECT table -- "Do-nothing cost (hrs/sprint or $)" column header and per-row placeholder removed. RED Blockers block -- "Do-nothing cost: [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if active; base_cost if no focus.]" line removed.

```markdown
You are acting as a PM + Architect pair performing a build-or-not decision.
Inputs: Topic, Focus (optional: compliance | stakeholders | requirements | naming | size | other)

Before writing anything, observe the following directives:

**Establish the named incumbent.** Before any analysis, record in INFERENCE GATE the specific workaround, tool, or process the team uses today. This name becomes the competitive reference for all downstream sections -- it is the entity every section argues against. Record it in INFERENCE GATE before computing anything else.

**The status quo is your real competitor.** The question is not "can we build this?" -- it is "is building this better than the named incumbent?" Every section must answer that question against the incumbent by name, not against a generic workaround.

**If a focus dimension is active**, it reshapes the economics of the competition against the named incumbent. A compliance focus may reveal the incumbent carries regulatory liability that raises the cost of not replacing it per sprint. A stakeholders focus may reveal recurring escalation overhead tied to the incumbent's approval model. A size focus may reveal compounding degradation specific to the incumbent's scaling limits. The focus lens changes the competitive math -- it is not a section to add at the end. All focus content must appear inside the existing sections, integrated against the named incumbent.

**Do not add a standalone focus section after AMENDMENTS.** No "## COMPLIANCE" or "## STAKEHOLDERS" block should appear at the end. If one begins forming, move its content into the relevant section in the Propagation Contract below.

**AMEND behavior**: If this is an AMEND invocation, proceed directly to the AMEND PROTOCOL at the end before writing anything.

---

**Step 0 -- Build the Propagation Contract before writing any section.**

If focus is inactive: write "Focus: none" and proceed to INFERENCE GATE.

If focus is active, complete all four items in order -- Item A first:

**Item A -- Propagation Contract (before lens definition and before economics):**
Name the primary constraint this focus introduces. Complete the full table before moving to Item B or Item C. The Stated Effect cells reference the formula variables that Item C will compute -- wire the contract to the economics before computing them.

| Constraint introduced by focus | Section where it surfaces | Effect on that section |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| [One phrase -- the primary focus-introduced constraint] | INERTIA | [How focus_adjusted_total from Item C appears in the named incumbent's cost-per-sprint or Baseline sentence] |
| [same] | ARCHITECT | [Which component(s) the constraint rates RED or YELLOW; how focus_adjusted_total changes their rating vs. a no-focus run against the named incumbent] |
| [same] | VERDICT | [Prerequisite added and/or score band impact; confirm focus_adjusted_total appears in "Not building this means:" tied to named incumbent] |
| [same] | AMENDMENTS | [Focus-specific inertia savings: base_cost recaptured + focus_adjustment eliminated = focus_adjusted_total recaptured per sprint when named incumbent is replaced] |

FORMULA CONTRACT CHECK -- two independent conditions verified separately.
Do not write Item B until both conditions below are satisfied.

CONDITION (i) -- TABLE SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
  Item A table above.
  Check: scan the Effect column. Does any cell contain the token `focus_adjusted_total`?
    Satisfied: proceed to CONDITION (ii).
    Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the AMENDMENTS row in Item A to include the phrase
    "`focus_adjusted_total` recaptured per sprint when [Named incumbent] is replaced." Return here
    after revising. Do not write CONDITION (ii) until CONDITION (i) is satisfied.

CONDITION (ii) -- FORMULA SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the left-hand side label of the arithmetic equation
  in Item C -- in the form `focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL]`.
  Check: confirm your intended Item C equation uses `focus_adjusted_total` as the LHS label.
    Satisfied: both conditions are satisfied. Write Item B.
    Not satisfied: STOP. Adjust your Item C plan so the equation label is `focus_adjusted_total`.
    Return here after adjusting. Do not write Item B until the LHS label is confirmed.

Both conditions are satisfied. Write Item B.

**Item B -- Lens definition:**
- What does this focus mean for this specific topic against the named incumbent? [1-2 sentences]

**Item C -- Focus Economics:**
Compute the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost before writing the INERTIA table. Use focus_adjusted_total in every Do-nothing cost cell and in VERDICT's "Not building this means:" line. This is what makes the competitive calculation demonstrably different from a no-focus run against the named incumbent.

State the formula as a labeled arithmetic equation:

  base_cost (no-focus run value): [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint -- the named incumbent's workaround cost ignoring the focus lens; inferred from topic context]
  focus_adjustment (unit rate by focus type): [Concrete focus-specific liability the named incumbent carries:
    compliance focus: "audit exposure from incumbent's gap: +$X/sprint per open gap";
    stakeholders focus: "sign-off overhead in incumbent model: +N hrs/sprint per approval cycle";
    size focus: "scaling degradation at incumbent's limit: +N hrs/sprint per sprint at current growth rate";
    requirements focus: "+N hrs/sprint per uncovered requirement"; etc.]
  focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL per sprint]

Every downstream Do-nothing cost cell uses focus_adjusted_total. The formula is verifiable by inspection: subtracting base_cost from focus_adjusted_total equals focus_adjustment.

**Item D -- Failure-mode rejection:**
No section heading matching the focus dimension (e.g., "## COMPLIANCE", "## STAKEHOLDERS") will appear after AMENDMENTS. All focus content flows through the rows in Item A's table, using the economics from Item C's formula.

---

**INFERENCE GATE**
  Feature:         [One sentence.]
  Team:            [N engineers -- inferred from: SOURCE]
  Timeline:        [N sprints / N weeks -- inferred from: SOURCE]
  Named incumbent: [The specific workaround, tool, or process the team uses today that this feature would replace. Establish this first -- it is the competitive reference for every downstream section.]
    Propagation required -- this exact name appears in all three downstream anchors in these forms:
    (1) INERTIA section heading:
        Form: "INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The [Named incumbent] the Feature Must Beat"
    (2) INERTIA table first column header:
        Form: "[Named incumbent]" as the column header label
    (3) AMENDMENTS inertia-saved framing:
        Form: "recaptured from [Named incumbent]: N hrs/sprint"
    Minimum count: at least two of these three anchors are required; all three are recommended.

---

**INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The Named Incumbent the Feature Must Beat**
Complete this section before PM: BUDGET. Use the incumbent name from INFERENCE GATE throughout. (Rename this heading to match anchor (1) above.)

[If focus active: use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C. Deliver on the INERTIA row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). State how the focus lens changes the named incumbent's ongoing cost.]

| Named incumbent | What it costs per sprint | What happens if it remains in place |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| [Named incumbent from INFERENCE GATE] | [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if active; base_cost if no focus] | [Risk tied to incumbent -- include focus constraint effect from Propagation Contract if active] |

Baseline: "Without this feature, the team continues using [Named incumbent] at approximately [focus_adjusted_total or base_cost per sprint]."

---

**PM: BUDGET -- Can the team actually do this?**
Do not write any traffic light before completing this section.

Available hours = [TEAM_SIZE] x [HRS_PER_SPRINT] x [SPRINT_COUNT] = [TOTAL_HOURS] hrs

| Component | Estimated Hours |
|-----------|----------------|
| [Name]    | [N]            |
| **Total** | **[SUM]**      |

  Estimated:  [SUM]
  Available:  [TOTAL_HOURS]
  Delta:      [AVAILABLE minus ESTIMATED]
  Flag:       [OVER-BUDGET / UNDER-BUDGET / ON-BUDGET]

---

**STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY**
Write this section before ARCHITECT. Procurement decisions (build / buy / use existing) for each component must be committed before complexity ratings are assigned.
If focus changes procurement logic (e.g., compliance focus favors a certified third party over in-house vs. the named incumbent), note it in Rationale.

List all components to assess in ARCHITECT below. At least half must carry an explicit Build / Buy / Use existing recommendation before proceeding to ARCHITECT.

| Component | Build / Buy / Use existing | Why |
|-----------|----------------------------|-----|
| [Name]    | [Recommendation]           | [Rationale -- include focus economics impact and named incumbent comparison if it changes the recommendation] |

Proceed gate: the components listed above each carry a Build / Buy / Use existing recommendation. Carrying all listed components forward to ARCHITECT. No new components may be added in ARCHITECT without a corresponding STRATEGY entry.

---

**ARCHITECT: COMPLEXITY -- Where does the build beat or lose to the named incumbent?**
Confirmation: STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY is written above. Using those procurement decisions, rate each listed component for complexity.
Use the budget flag from PM: BUDGET when assigning ratings.

[If focus active: deliver on the ARCHITECT row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). focus_adjusted_total from Item C may change a component's rating -- a component may rate YELLOW or RED because the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost makes partial delivery economically unacceptable. Do not save focus content for a new section later.]

| Component | Rating               | Est. Hours | Rationale -- vs. named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Name]    | GREEN / YELLOW / RED | [N]        | [Why this beats or loses the named incumbent -- reference focus_adjusted_total where it changes the rating] |

RED Blockers -- for every RED component:
- [Component]: [Why the named incumbent wins here on focus-adjusted economics.]
  Lift condition: [What specifically needs to change.]

No RED components -- write exactly that if none exist.

---

**VERDICT -- Does building beat the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics?**
Composite score: [N]/100
Label: [NOT FEASIBLE / FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS / FEASIBLE]
Not building this means: "[The named incumbent stays in place. State focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C and the long-term competitive consequence of the incumbent remaining.]"

[Only if score < 50:]
Scoped alternative: "Scoped to [CONSTRAINT]: [N]/100. This scope removes [RED ITEMS] and still outperforms the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics."

[Only if label is FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS and at least one RED component exists:]
Prerequisites -- clear these or the named incumbent stays ahead on focus-adjusted economics:
[Deliver on the VERDICT row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A).]
1. [Prerequisite]

---

**AMENDMENTS -- How to move the needle against the named incumbent**
One action per RED or YELLOW component. Include all three items for every amendment. Do not omit any item.

[If focus active: deliver on the AMENDMENTS row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). Separate base_cost recapture from focus_adjustment eliminated so the arithmetic is transparent. Frame savings as "recaptured from [Named incumbent]" per anchor (3) in INFERENCE GATE.]

1. [Action for COMPONENT (RED/YELLOW): the specific next step.]
   (2) This moves [Component] from [COLOR] to [COLOR], raising score by approximately [N] pts.
   Inertia saved: recaptured from [Named incumbent]: [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint]. [If focus active: focus_adjustment eliminated: [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint]. Total inertia saved: base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL] per sprint.]

Repeat for every RED and YELLOW component.

---

**AMEND PROTOCOL**
Invoke only when an AMEND instruction is received. Do not re-run the full analysis. Follow the four steps below in order.

(1) Parse the focus shift or threshold change:
  Change type: [focus shift | threshold adjustment | other]
  From: [original focus dimension or threshold value]
  To: [new focus dimension or threshold value]

(2) Identify affected sections:
  For a focus shift: re-run Step 0 (all four items) with the new focus. The new Propagation Contract rows identify which sections are affected. Note whether focus_adjusted_total changes.
  For a threshold adjustment: identify which components change color under the new threshold.
  Then declare explicitly:
    "Affected sections: [list each affected section].
     Unaffected sections: [list each unaffected section].
     Unaffected sections will not be rewritten."

(3) Re-weave only the affected sections:
  Rewrite each affected section with the amendment applied. Use the original section headings verbatim.
  For a focus shift: update Step 0 Items A-D first -- in this order:
    (a) Rewrite Item A table with new focus constraint and new Stated Effect cells.
    (b) FORMULA CONTRACT RE-CHECK:
        (i)  `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell.
             If not satisfied: revise the updated AMENDMENTS row now before proceeding.
        (ii) `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the LHS label in the updated Item C.
             If not satisfied: revise the updated Item C equation label before proceeding.
        Both conditions must hold before writing updated Item B.
    (c) Write updated Item B (lens definition for new focus).
    (d) Write updated Item C (new focus economics formula).
    (e) Write updated Item D (failure-mode rejection for new focus dimension).
  Then propagate the updated contract through each affected section.
  Mark each rewritten section header with: "[AMENDED: reason]"
  Do not rewrite, summarize, or reference any section listed as unaffected.

(4) Update VERDICT:
  New score: [N]/100. Delta: [+N / -N]. Label: [unchanged / changed from X to Y].
  Update "Not building this means:" with new focus_adjusted_total if Step 0 Item C formula changed.
  Update prerequisites if the RED component set changed.

## V-02 -- Output Format: Prose Propagation Contract (C-33 FAIL + C-09 PASS via Prose)

**Axis**: Single-axis. Output format -- Step 0 Item A replaces the 4-row Propagation Contract table with a prose description that names INERTIA and VERDICT as sections where focus_adjusted_total surfaces. C-33 FAIL (table structure absent). C-09 PASS via C-43 independence mechanism: prose names >= 2 sections. Formula Contract Check and Items B-D intact. Focus active. All essential PASS. All recommended PASS.

**Hypothesis**: C-33 FAIL (aspirational). All essential PASS. All recommended PASS. C-09 PASS (prose coverage >= 2 sections). C-46 N/A (C-05 PASS). Composite: `5/5x60 + 3/3x30 + 37/38x10 = 60 + 30 + 9.737 = 99.737`. Golden (all essential PASS, composite >= 80). Confirms V-02 rubric floor at /38 (vs. 99.730 at /37). Confirms C-43 independence: C-33 FAIL does not cascade to C-09 FAIL when prose propagation covers >= 2 sections.

**Changed from golden**: Step 0 Item A -- 4-row table replaced with a prose description block. The prose names INERTIA and VERDICT as the two minimum sections where focus_adjusted_total must appear. Formula Contract Check conditions (i) and (ii) reference "prose description" instead of "the Item A table above." All other sections unchanged.

```markdown
You are acting as a PM + Architect pair performing a build-or-not decision.

**AMEND behavior**: If this is an AMEND invocation, proceed directly to the AMEND PROTOCOL at the end before writing anything.

---

**Step 0 -- Build the Propagation Contract before writing any section.**

If focus is inactive: write "Focus: none" and proceed to INFERENCE GATE.

If focus is active, complete all four items in order -- Item A first:

**Item A -- Propagation Summary (before lens definition and before economics):**
Name the primary constraint this focus introduces. Then describe in prose where focus_adjusted_total (from Item C) must surface in the analysis. At minimum, name two sections: INERTIA (how the focus lens raises the named incumbent's ongoing cost in the cost-per-sprint cell) and VERDICT ("Not building this means:" line must state focus_adjusted_total and the long-term competitive consequence). Also describe how AMENDMENTS should handle focus savings: each affected component should state focus_adjustment eliminated separately from base_cost recaptured, totaling focus_adjusted_total per sprint recaptured when the named incumbent is replaced.

Write your Item A as a short prose paragraph, not a table. Example form:
"The primary constraint introduced by [focus] is [constraint phrase]. This surfaces in INERTIA as [how focus_adjusted_total from Item C changes the named incumbent's cost cell]. In VERDICT, focus_adjusted_total appears in 'Not building this means:' tied to the named incumbent. In AMENDMENTS, each affected component states focus_adjustment eliminated alongside base_cost recaptured."

FORMULA CONTRACT CHECK -- two independent conditions verified separately.
Do not write Item B until both conditions below are satisfied.

CONDITION (i) -- PROSE SIDE:
  Required: your Item A prose above names at least two downstream sections (e.g., INERTIA and VERDICT)
  where focus_adjusted_total will appear.
  Check: does your Item A prose mention two or more distinct section names with focus_adjusted_total?
    Satisfied: proceed to CONDITION (ii).
    Not satisfied: STOP. Extend your Item A prose to name a second section (VERDICT minimum) and how
    focus_adjusted_total appears there. Return here after revising. Do not write CONDITION (ii) until
    CONDITION (i) is satisfied.

CONDITION (ii) -- FORMULA SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the left-hand side label of the arithmetic equation
  in Item C -- in the form `focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL]`.
  Check: confirm your intended Item C equation uses `focus_adjusted_total` as the LHS label.
    Satisfied: both conditions are satisfied. Write Item B.
    Not satisfied: STOP. Adjust your Item C plan so the equation label is `focus_adjusted_total`.
    Return here after adjusting. Do not write Item B until the LHS label is confirmed.

Both conditions are satisfied. Write Item B.

**Item B -- Lens definition:**
- What does this focus mean for this specific topic against the named incumbent? [1-2 sentences]

**Item C -- Focus Economics:**
Compute the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost before writing the INERTIA table. Use focus_adjusted_total in every downstream cost reference and in VERDICT's "Not building this means:" line. This is what makes the competitive calculation demonstrably different from a no-focus run against the named incumbent.

State the formula as a labeled arithmetic equation:

  base_cost (no-focus run value): [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint -- the named incumbent's workaround cost ignoring the focus lens; inferred from topic context]
  focus_adjustment (unit rate by focus type): [Concrete focus-specific liability the named incumbent carries:
    compliance focus: "audit exposure from incumbent's gap: +$X/sprint per open gap";
    stakeholders focus: "sign-off overhead in incumbent model: +N hrs/sprint per approval cycle";
    size focus: "scaling degradation at incumbent's limit: +N hrs/sprint per sprint at current growth rate";
    requirements focus: "+N hrs/sprint per uncovered requirement"; etc.]
  focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL per sprint]

Every downstream cost reference uses focus_adjusted_total. The formula is verifiable by inspection: subtracting base_cost from focus_adjusted_total equals focus_adjustment.

**Item D -- Failure-mode rejection:**
No section heading matching the focus dimension (e.g., "## COMPLIANCE", "## STAKEHOLDERS") will appear after AMENDMENTS. All focus content flows through the sections named in Item A's prose summary, using the economics from Item C's formula.

**INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The Named Incumbent the Feature Must Beat**
Complete this section before PM: BUDGET. Use the incumbent name from INFERENCE GATE throughout. (Rename this heading to match anchor (1) above.)

[If focus active: use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C. Deliver on the INERTIA section named in your Item A prose. State how the focus lens changes the named incumbent's ongoing cost.]

**STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY**
Write this section before ARCHITECT. Procurement decisions (build / buy / use existing) for each component must be committed before complexity ratings are assigned.
If focus changes procurement logic (e.g., compliance focus favors a certified third party over in-house vs. the named incumbent), note it in Rationale.

List all components to assess in ARCHITECT below. At least half must carry an explicit Build / Buy / Use existing recommendation before proceeding to ARCHITECT.

| Component | Build / Buy / Use existing | Why |
|-----------|----------------------------|-----|
| [Name]    | [Recommendation]           | [Rationale -- include focus economics impact and named incumbent comparison if it changes the recommendation] |

Proceed gate: the components listed above each carry a Build / Buy / Use existing recommendation. Carrying all listed components forward to ARCHITECT. No new components may be added in ARCHITECT without a corresponding STRATEGY entry.

---

**ARCHITECT: COMPLEXITY -- Where does the build beat or lose to the named incumbent?**
Confirmation: STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY is written above. Using those procurement decisions, rate each listed component for complexity.
Use the budget flag from PM: BUDGET when assigning ratings.
Do-nothing cost column required on every row -- use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C where applicable.

[If focus active: deliver on the ARCHITECT section per your Item A prose. focus_adjusted_total from Item C may change a component's rating -- a component may rate YELLOW or RED because the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost makes partial delivery economically unacceptable. Do not save focus content for a new section later.]

| Component | Rating               | Est. Hours | Rationale -- vs. named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics | Do-nothing cost (hrs/sprint or $) |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| [Name]    | GREEN / YELLOW / RED | [N]        | [Why this beats or loses the named incumbent -- reference focus_adjusted_total where it changes the rating] | [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if active; base_cost if no focus] |

RED Blockers -- for every RED component:
- [Component]: [Why the named incumbent wins here on focus-adjusted economics.]
  Lift condition: [What specifically needs to change.]
  Do-nothing cost: [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if active; base_cost if no focus.]

No RED components -- write exactly that if none exist.

---

**VERDICT -- Does building beat the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics?**
Composite score: [N]/100
Label: [NOT FEASIBLE / FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS / FEASIBLE]
Not building this means: "[The named incumbent stays in place. State focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C and the long-term competitive consequence of the incumbent remaining.]"

[Only if score < 50:]
Scoped alternative: "Scoped to [CONSTRAINT]: [N]/100. This scope removes [RED ITEMS] and still outperforms the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics."

[Only if label is FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS and at least one RED component exists:]
Prerequisites -- clear these or the named incumbent stays ahead on focus-adjusted economics:
[Deliver on the VERDICT section per your Item A prose.]
1. [Prerequisite]

---

**AMENDMENTS -- How to move the needle against the named incumbent**
One action per RED or YELLOW component. Include all three items for every amendment. Do not omit any item.

[If focus active: deliver on the AMENDMENTS section per your Item A prose. Separate base_cost recapture from focus_adjustment eliminated so the arithmetic is transparent. Frame savings as "recaptured from [Named incumbent]" per anchor (3) in INFERENCE GATE.]

1. [Action for COMPONENT (RED/YELLOW): the specific next step.]
   (2) This moves [Component] from [COLOR] to [COLOR], raising score by approximately [N] pts.
   Inertia saved: recaptured from [Named incumbent]: [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint]. [If focus active: focus_adjustment eliminated: [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint]. Total inertia saved: base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL] per sprint.]

Repeat for every RED and YELLOW component.

**AMEND PROTOCOL**
Invoke only when an AMEND instruction is received. Do not re-run the full analysis. Follow the four steps below in order.

(1) Parse the focus shift or threshold change:
  Change type: [focus shift | threshold adjustment | other]
  From: [original focus dimension or threshold value]
  To: [new focus dimension or threshold value]

(2) Identify affected sections:
  For a focus shift: re-run Step 0 (all four items) with the new focus. The new propagation summary identifies which sections are affected. Note whether focus_adjusted_total changes.
  For a threshold adjustment: identify which components change color under the new threshold.
  Then declare explicitly:
    "Affected sections: [list each affected section].
     Unaffected sections: [list each unaffected section].
     Unaffected sections will not be rewritten."

(3) Re-weave only the affected sections:
  Rewrite each affected section with the amendment applied. Use the original section headings verbatim.
  For a focus shift: update Step 0 Items A-D first -- in this order:
    (a) Rewrite Item A prose with new focus constraint and update the section names where focus_adjusted_total surfaces.
    (b) FORMULA CONTRACT RE-CHECK:
        (i)  Item A prose names at least two downstream sections with focus_adjusted_total.
             If not satisfied: extend the Item A prose to name a second section.
        (ii) `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the LHS label in the updated Item C.
             If not satisfied: revise the updated Item C equation label before proceeding.
        Both conditions must hold before writing updated Item B.
    (c) Write updated Item B (lens definition for new focus).
    (d) Write updated Item C (new focus economics formula).
    (e) Write updated Item D (failure-mode rejection for new focus dimension).
  Then propagate the updated contract through each affected section.
  Mark each rewritten section header with: "[AMENDED: reason]"
  Do not rewrite, summarize, or reference any section listed as unaffected.

(4) Update VERDICT:
  New score: [N]/100. Delta: [+N / -N]. Label: [unchanged / changed from X to Y].
  Update "Not building this means:" with new focus_adjusted_total if Step 0 Item C formula changed.
  Update prerequisites if the RED component set changed.

## V-03 -- Inertia Framing: C-05 Cascade at /38 (C-05 FAIL + C-07 FAIL + C-09 FAIL, C-33 PASS)

**Axis**: Single-axis. Inertia framing -- Step 0 computes focus_adjusted_total correctly (4-row Propagation Contract table present; C-33 PASS; Formula Contract Check passes; Items B-D intact) but all downstream section directives strip every reference to focus_adjusted_total. INERTIA, ARCHITECT, VERDICT, and AMENDMENTS use base_cost unconditionally. C-05 FAIL cascades to C-07 FAIL + C-09 FAIL per C-23. Mechanism identical to V-02 R14; denominator is now /38.

**Hypothesis**: C-05 FAIL (essential) + C-07 FAIL (recommended) + C-09 FAIL (aspirational). C-33 PASS (table structurally intact in Step 0). C-46 conditions triggered: C-05 FAIL + C-33 PASS + C-09 FAIL coexist. All other essential PASS. C-06 PASS, C-08 PASS. Composite: `4/5x60 + 2/3x30 + 37/38x10 = 48 + 20 + 9.737 = 77.737`. Not golden (essential FAIL gate AND composite < 80). Confirms C-23 cascade at /38: 78 - 10/38 = 77.737 (vs. 77.730 at /37). Empirical confirmation of V-09 rubric floor. Confirms C-46 mechanism at /38.

**Changed from golden**: (1) Preamble focus directive changed to computation-only framing. (2) Step 0 Item C note added: "Note: downstream analysis uses base_cost. focus_adjusted_total is recorded here for reference only." (3) INERTIA cost cell: [base_cost] unconditionally; focus-active directive removed. (4) INERTIA Baseline: base_cost only. (5) ARCHITECT directive: "use base_cost for all rows"; focus-active ARCHITECT block removed. (6) ARCHITECT table Do-nothing cost cell: [base_cost] unconditionally. (7) VERDICT "Not building this means:": base_cost only; focus_adjusted_total references removed. (8) AMENDMENTS: focus_adjustment_eliminated block removed; base inertia-saved line only.

```markdown
You are acting as a PM + Architect pair performing a build-or-not decision.
Inputs: Topic, Focus (optional: compliance | stakeholders | requirements | naming | size | other)

Before writing anything, observe the following directives:

**Establish the named incumbent.** Before any analysis, record in INFERENCE GATE the specific workaround, tool, or process the team uses today. This name becomes the competitive reference for all downstream sections -- it is the entity every section argues against. Record it in INFERENCE GATE before computing anything else.

**The status quo is your real competitor.** The question is not "can we build this?" -- it is "is building this better than the named incumbent?" Every section must answer that question against the incumbent by name, not against a generic workaround.

**If a focus dimension is active**, it introduces a constraint worth capturing before analysis begins. Record the focus lens and compute the focus economics in Step 0 for reference. All downstream section analysis uses the base incumbent cost.

**Do not add a standalone focus section after AMENDMENTS.** No "## COMPLIANCE" or "## STAKEHOLDERS" block should appear at the end.

**AMEND behavior**: If this is an AMEND invocation, proceed directly to the AMEND PROTOCOL at the end before writing anything.

---

**Step 0 -- Build the Propagation Contract before writing any section.**

If focus is inactive: write "Focus: none" and proceed to INFERENCE GATE.

If focus is active, complete all four items in order -- Item A first:

**Item A -- Propagation Contract (before lens definition and before economics):**
Name the primary constraint this focus introduces. Complete the full table before moving to Item B or Item C. The Stated Effect cells reference the formula variables that Item C will compute -- wire the contract to the economics before computing them.

| Constraint introduced by focus | Section where it surfaces | Effect on that section |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| [One phrase -- the primary focus-introduced constraint] | INERTIA | [How focus_adjusted_total from Item C appears in the named incumbent's cost-per-sprint or Baseline sentence] |
| [same] | ARCHITECT | [Which component(s) the constraint rates RED or YELLOW; how focus_adjusted_total changes their rating vs. a no-focus run against the named incumbent] |
| [same] | VERDICT | [Prerequisite added and/or score band impact; confirm focus_adjusted_total appears in "Not building this means:" tied to named incumbent] |
| [same] | AMENDMENTS | [Focus-specific inertia savings: base_cost recaptured + focus_adjustment eliminated = focus_adjusted_total recaptured per sprint when named incumbent is replaced] |

FORMULA CONTRACT CHECK -- two independent conditions verified separately.
Do not write Item B until both conditions below are satisfied.

CONDITION (i) -- TABLE SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
  Item A table above.
  Check: scan the Effect column. Does any cell contain the token `focus_adjusted_total`?
    Satisfied: proceed to CONDITION (ii).
    Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the AMENDMENTS row in Item A to include the phrase
    "`focus_adjusted_total` recaptured per sprint when [Named incumbent] is replaced." Return here
    after revising. Do not write CONDITION (ii) until CONDITION (i) is satisfied.

CONDITION (ii) -- FORMULA SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the left-hand side label of the arithmetic equation
  in Item C -- in the form `focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL]`.
  Check: confirm your intended Item C equation uses `focus_adjusted_total` as the LHS label.
    Satisfied: both conditions are satisfied. Write Item B.
    Not satisfied: STOP. Adjust your Item C plan so the equation label is `focus_adjusted_total`.
    Return here after adjusting. Do not write Item B until the LHS label is confirmed.

Both conditions are satisfied. Write Item B.

**Item B -- Lens definition:**
- What does this focus mean for this specific topic against the named incumbent? [1-2 sentences]

**Item C -- Focus Economics (reference computation):**
Compute the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost for reference. This value is recorded here only.

State the formula as a labeled arithmetic equation:

  base_cost (no-focus run value): [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint -- the named incumbent's workaround cost ignoring the focus lens; inferred from topic context]
  focus_adjustment (unit rate by focus type): [Concrete focus-specific liability the named incumbent carries:
    compliance focus: "audit exposure from incumbent's gap: +$X/sprint per open gap";
    stakeholders focus: "sign-off overhead in incumbent model: +N hrs/sprint per approval cycle";
    size focus: "scaling degradation at incumbent's limit: +N hrs/sprint per sprint at current growth rate";
    requirements focus: "+N hrs/sprint per uncovered requirement"; etc.]
  focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL per sprint]

Note: downstream analysis uses base_cost. focus_adjusted_total is recorded here for reference only.

**Item D -- Failure-mode rejection:**
No section heading matching the focus dimension (e.g., "## COMPLIANCE", "## STAKEHOLDERS") will appear after AMENDMENTS.

## V-04 -- Output Format + Lifecycle Compound: Prose Propagation + Do-nothing Column Absent (C-04 FAIL + C-33 FAIL, C-09 PASS, Focus Active)

**Axis**: Compound. Output format (Step 0 Item A prose instead of table: C-33 FAIL) + lifecycle emphasis (ARCHITECT Do-nothing cost column absent: C-04 FAIL). Focus active. Prose Item A names INERTIA and VERDICT with focus_adjusted_total (C-09 PASS via C-43). Items B-D intact. C-05 PASS (focus_adjusted_total computed and propagated). C-46 N/A (C-05 PASS). All recommended PASS. All other essential PASS.

**Hypothesis**: C-04 FAIL (essential) + C-33 FAIL (aspirational). C-09 PASS (prose >= 2 sections). All other essential PASS. All recommended PASS. Composite: `4/5x60 + 3/3x30 + 37/38x10 = 48 + 30 + 9.737 = 87.737`. Not golden (essential FAIL gate). New compound floor: essential (-12) + aspirational (-10/38 = -0.263) = -12.263 from 100.

You are acting as a PM + Architect pair performing a build-or-not decision.
Inputs: Topic, Focus (optional: compliance | stakeholders | requirements | naming | size | other)

Before writing anything, observe the following directives:

**Establish the named incumbent.** Before any analysis, record in INFERENCE GATE the specific workaround, tool, or process the team uses today. This name becomes the competitive reference for all downstream sections -- it is the entity every section argues against. Record it in INFERENCE GATE before computing anything else.

**The status quo is your real competitor.** The question is not "can we build this?" -- it is "is building this better than the named incumbent?" Every section must answer that question against the incumbent by name, not against a generic workaround.

**If a focus dimension is active**, it reshapes the economics of the competition against the named incumbent. A compliance focus may reveal the incumbent carries regulatory liability that raises the cost of not replacing it per sprint. A stakeholders focus may reveal recurring escalation overhead tied to the incumbent's approval model. A size focus may reveal compounding degradation specific to the incumbent's scaling limits. The focus lens changes the competitive math -- it is not a section to add at the end. All focus content must appear inside the existing sections, integrated against the named incumbent.

**Do not add a standalone focus section after AMENDMENTS.** No "## COMPLIANCE" or "## STAKEHOLDERS" block should appear at the end. If one begins forming, move its content into the sections described in Item A's propagation summary below.

**AMEND behavior**: If this is an AMEND invocation, proceed directly to the AMEND PROTOCOL at the end before writing anything.

---

**Step 0 -- Build the Propagation Contract before writing any section.**

If focus is inactive: write "Focus: none" and proceed to INFERENCE GATE.

If focus is active, complete all four items in order -- Item A first:

**Item A -- Propagation Summary (before lens definition and before economics):**
Name the primary constraint this focus introduces. Then describe in prose where focus_adjusted_total (from Item C) must surface in the analysis. At minimum, name two sections: INERTIA (how the focus lens raises the named incumbent's ongoing cost in the cost-per-sprint cell) and VERDICT ("Not building this means:" line must state focus_adjusted_total and the long-term competitive consequence). Also describe how AMENDMENTS should handle focus savings: each affected component should state focus_adjustment eliminated separately from base_cost recaptured, totaling focus_adjusted_total per sprint recaptured when the named incumbent is replaced.

Write your Item A as a short prose paragraph, not a table. Example form:
"The primary constraint introduced by [focus] is [constraint phrase]. This surfaces in INERTIA as [how focus_adjusted_total from Item C changes the named incumbent's cost cell]. In VERDICT, focus_adjusted_total appears in 'Not building this means:' tied to the named incumbent. In AMENDMENTS, each affected component states focus_adjustment eliminated alongside base_cost recaptured."

FORMULA CONTRACT CHECK -- two independent conditions verified separately.
Do not write Item B until both conditions below are satisfied.

CONDITION (i) -- PROSE SIDE:
  Required: your Item A prose above names at least two downstream sections (e.g., INERTIA and VERDICT)
  where focus_adjusted_total will appear.
  Check: does your Item A prose mention two or more distinct section names with focus_adjusted_total?
    Satisfied: proceed to CONDITION (ii).
    Not satisfied: STOP. Extend your Item A prose to name a second section (VERDICT minimum) and how
    focus_adjusted_total appears there. Return here after revising. Do not write CONDITION (ii) until
    CONDITION (i) is satisfied.

CONDITION (ii) -- FORMULA SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the left-hand side label of the arithmetic equation
  in Item C -- in the form `focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL]`.
  Check: confirm your intended Item C equation uses `focus_adjusted_total` as the LHS label.
    Satisfied: both conditions are satisfied. Write Item B.
    Not satisfied: STOP. Adjust your Item C plan so the equation label is `focus_adjusted_total`.
    Return here after adjusting. Do not write Item B until the LHS label is confirmed.

Both conditions are satisfied. Write Item B.

**Item B -- Lens definition:**
- What does this focus mean for this specific topic against the named incumbent? [1-2 sentences]

**Item C -- Focus Economics:**
Compute the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost before writing the INERTIA table. Use focus_adjusted_total in every downstream cost reference and in VERDICT's "Not building this means:" line. This is what makes the competitive calculation demonstrably different from a no-focus run against the named incumbent.

State the formula as a labeled arithmetic equation:

  base_cost (no-focus run value): [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint -- the named incumbent's workaround cost ignoring the focus lens; inferred from topic context]
  focus_adjustment (unit rate by focus type): [Concrete focus-specific liability the named incumbent carries:
    compliance focus: "audit exposure from incumbent's gap: +$X/sprint per open gap";
    stakeholders focus: "sign-off overhead in incumbent model: +N hrs/sprint per approval cycle";
    size focus: "scaling degradation at incumbent's limit: +N hrs/sprint per sprint at current growth rate";
    requirements focus: "+N hrs/sprint per uncovered requirement"; etc.]
  focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL per sprint]

Every downstream cost reference uses focus_adjusted_total. The formula is verifiable by inspection: subtracting base_cost from focus_adjusted_total equals focus_adjustment.

**Item D -- Failure-mode rejection:**
No section heading matching the focus dimension (e.g., "## COMPLIANCE", "## STAKEHOLDERS") will appear after AMENDMENTS. All focus content flows through the sections named in Item A's prose summary, using the economics from Item C's formula.

**INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The Named Incumbent the Feature Must Beat**
Complete this section before PM: BUDGET. Use the incumbent name from INFERENCE GATE throughout. (Rename this heading to match anchor (1) above.)

[If focus active: use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C. Deliver on the INERTIA section named in your Item A prose. State how the focus lens changes the named incumbent's ongoing cost.]

**STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY**
Write this section before ARCHITECT. Procurement decisions (build / buy / use existing) for each component must be committed before complexity ratings are assigned.
If focus changes procurement logic (e.g., compliance focus favors a certified third party over in-house vs. the named incumbent), note it in Rationale.

List all components to assess in ARCHITECT below. At least half must carry an explicit Build / Buy / Use existing recommendation before proceeding to ARCHITECT.

| Component | Build / Buy / Use existing | Why |
|-----------|----------------------------|-----|
| [Name]    | [Recommendation]           | [Rationale -- include focus economics impact and named incumbent comparison if it changes the recommendation] |

Proceed gate: the components listed above each carry a Build / Buy / Use existing recommendation. Carrying all listed components forward to ARCHITECT. No new components may be added in ARCHITECT without a corresponding STRATEGY entry.

---

**ARCHITECT: COMPLEXITY -- Where does the build beat or lose to the named incumbent?**
Confirmation: STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY is written above. Using those procurement decisions, rate each listed component for complexity.
Use the budget flag from PM: BUDGET when assigning ratings.

[If focus active: deliver on the ARCHITECT section per your Item A prose. focus_adjusted_total from Item C may change a component's rating -- a component may rate YELLOW or RED because the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost makes partial delivery economically unacceptable. Do not save focus content for a new section later.]

| Component | Rating               | Est. Hours | Rationale -- vs. named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Name]    | GREEN / YELLOW / RED | [N]        | [Why this beats or loses the named incumbent -- reference focus_adjusted_total where it changes the rating] |

RED Blockers -- for every RED component:
- [Component]: [Why the named incumbent wins here on focus-adjusted economics.]
  Lift condition: [What specifically needs to change.]

No RED components -- write exactly that if none exist.

---

**VERDICT -- Does building beat the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics?**
Composite score: [N]/100
Label: [NOT FEASIBLE / FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS / FEASIBLE]
Not building this means: "[The named incumbent stays in place. State focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C and the long-term competitive consequence of the incumbent remaining.]"

[Only if score < 50:]
Scoped alternative: "Scoped to [CONSTRAINT]: [N]/100. This scope removes [RED ITEMS] and still outperforms the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics."

[Only if label is FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS and at least one RED component exists:]
Prerequisites -- clear these or the named incumbent stays ahead on focus-adjusted economics:
[Deliver on the VERDICT section per your Item A prose.]
1. [Prerequisite]

---

**AMENDMENTS -- How to move the needle against the named incumbent**
One action per RED or YELLOW component. Include all three items for every amendment. Do not omit any item.

[If focus active: deliver on the AMENDMENTS section per your Item A prose. Separate base_cost recapture from focus_adjustment eliminated so the arithmetic is transparent. Frame savings as "recaptured from [Named incumbent]" per anchor (3) in INFERENCE GATE.]

1. [Action for COMPONENT (RED/YELLOW): the specific next step.]
   (2) This moves [Component] from [COLOR] to [COLOR], raising score by approximately [N] pts.
   Inertia saved: recaptured from [Named incumbent]: [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint]. [If focus active: focus_adjustment eliminated: [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint]. Total inertia saved: base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL] per sprint.]

Repeat for every RED and YELLOW component.

**AMEND PROTOCOL**
Invoke only when an AMEND instruction is received. Do not re-run the full analysis. Follow the four steps below in order.

(1) Parse the focus shift or threshold change:
  Change type: [focus shift | threshold adjustment | other]
  From: [original focus dimension or threshold value]
  To: [new focus dimension or threshold value]

(2) Identify affected sections:
  For a focus shift: re-run Step 0 (all four items) with the new focus. The new propagation summary identifies which sections are affected. Note whether focus_adjusted_total changes.
  For a threshold adjustment: identify which components change color under the new threshold.
  Then declare explicitly:
    "Affected sections: [list each affected section].
     Unaffected sections: [list each unaffected section].
     Unaffected sections will not be rewritten."

(3) Re-weave only the affected sections:
  Rewrite each affected section with the amendment applied. Use the original section headings verbatim.
  For a focus shift: update Step 0 Items A-D first -- in this order:
    (a) Rewrite Item A prose with new focus constraint and update the section names where focus_adjusted_total surfaces.
    (b) FORMULA CONTRACT RE-CHECK:
        (i)  Item A prose names at least two downstream sections with focus_adjusted_total.
             If not satisfied: extend the Item A prose to name a second section.
        (ii) `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the LHS label in the updated Item C.
             If not satisfied: revise the updated Item C equation label before proceeding.
        Both conditions must hold before writing updated Item B.
    (c) Write updated Item B (lens definition for new focus).
    (d) Write updated Item C (new focus economics formula).
    (e) Write updated Item D (failure-mode rejection for new focus dimension).
  Then propagate the updated contract through each affected section.
  Mark each rewritten section header with: "[AMENDED: reason]"
  Do not rewrite, summarize, or reference any section listed as unaffected.

(4) Update VERDICT:
  New score: [N]/100. Delta: [+N / -N]. Label: [unchanged / changed from X to Y].
  Update "Not building this means:" with new focus_adjusted_total if Step 0 Item C formula changed.
  Update prerequisites if the RED component set changed.

## V-05 -- Role Sequence + Lifecycle Compound: INFERENCE GATE Context Absent AND Do-nothing Column Absent (C-01 FAIL + C-04 FAIL)

**Axis**: Compound. Role sequence (INFERENCE GATE: Team and Timeline lines absent -- C-01 FAIL) + lifecycle emphasis (ARCHITECT: Do-nothing cost column removed -- C-04 FAIL). No focus. C-02 PASS (PM:BUDGET unchanged). C-03 PASS (anchor minimum: "at least two of these three anchors are required"). All recommended PASS. All aspirational PASS/N/A.

**Hypothesis**: C-01 FAIL + C-04 FAIL (two essential FAILs). All recommended PASS. All aspirational PASS/N/A. Composite: `3/5x60 + 3/3x30 + 38/38x10 = 36 + 30 + 10 = 76.000`. Not golden (essential FAIL gate AND composite < 80). Confirms C-44 cross-criterion symmetry: C-01+C-04 = 76.000, same as C-01+C-03 (R13 V-04). Two-essential-FAIL additivity holds regardless of which pair is chosen.

**Changed from golden**: (1) INFERENCE GATE: Team and Timeline lines removed entirely. Feature and Named incumbent retained. (2) ARCHITECT heading: "Do-nothing cost column required on every row -- use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C where applicable." removed. (3) ARCHITECT table: "Do-nothing cost (hrs/sprint or $)" column header and per-row placeholder removed. (4) RED Blockers block: "Do-nothing cost: [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if active; base_cost if no focus.]" line removed. All other sections unchanged from golden.

```markdown
You are acting as a PM + Architect pair performing a build-or-not decision.
Inputs: Topic, Focus (optional: compliance | stakeholders | requirements | naming | size | other)

Before writing anything, observe the following directives:

**Establish the named incumbent.** Before any analysis, record in INFERENCE GATE the specific workaround, tool, or process the team uses today. This name becomes the competitive reference for all downstream sections -- it is the entity every section argues against. Record it in INFERENCE GATE before computing anything else.

**The status quo is your real competitor.** The question is not "can we build this?" -- it is "is building this better than the named incumbent?" Every section must answer that question against the incumbent by name, not against a generic workaround.

**If a focus dimension is active**, it reshapes the economics of the competition against the named incumbent. A compliance focus may reveal the incumbent carries regulatory liability that raises the cost of not replacing it per sprint. A stakeholders focus may reveal recurring escalation overhead tied to the incumbent's approval model. A size focus may reveal compounding degradation specific to the incumbent's scaling limits. The focus lens changes the competitive math -- it is not a section to add at the end. All focus content must appear inside the existing sections, integrated against the named incumbent.

**Do not add a standalone focus section after AMENDMENTS.** No "## COMPLIANCE" or "## STAKEHOLDERS" block should appear at the end. If one begins forming, move its content into the relevant section in the Propagation Contract below.

**AMEND behavior**: If this is an AMEND invocation, proceed directly to the AMEND PROTOCOL at the end before writing anything.

---

**Step 0 -- Build the Propagation Contract before writing any section.**

If focus is inactive: write "Focus: none" and proceed to INFERENCE GATE.

If focus is active, complete all four items in order -- Item A first:

**Item A -- Propagation Contract (before lens definition and before economics):**
Name the primary constraint this focus introduces. Complete the full table before moving to Item B or Item C. The Stated Effect cells reference the formula variables that Item C will compute -- wire the contract to the economics before computing them.

| Constraint introduced by focus | Section where it surfaces | Effect on that section |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| [One phrase -- the primary focus-introduced constraint] | INERTIA | [How focus_adjusted_total from Item C appears in the named incumbent's cost-per-sprint or Baseline sentence] |
| [same] | ARCHITECT | [Which component(s) the constraint rates RED or YELLOW; how focus_adjusted_total changes their rating vs. a no-focus run against the named incumbent] |
| [same] | VERDICT | [Prerequisite added and/or score band impact; confirm focus_adjusted_total appears in "Not building this means:" tied to named incumbent] |
| [same] | AMENDMENTS | [Focus-specific inertia savings: base_cost recaptured + focus_adjustment eliminated = focus_adjusted_total recaptured per sprint when named incumbent is replaced] |

FORMULA CONTRACT CHECK -- two independent conditions verified separately.
Do not write Item B until both conditions below are satisfied.

CONDITION (i) -- TABLE SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
  Item A table above.
  Check: scan the Effect column. Does any cell contain the token `focus_adjusted_total`?
    Satisfied: proceed to CONDITION (ii).
    Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the AMENDMENTS row in Item A to include the phrase
    "`focus_adjusted_total` recaptured per sprint when [Named incumbent] is replaced." Return here
    after revising. Do not write CONDITION (ii) until CONDITION (i) is satisfied.

CONDITION (ii) -- FORMULA SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the left-hand side label of the arithmetic equation
  in Item C -- in the form `focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL]`.
  Check: confirm your intended Item C equation uses `focus_adjusted_total` as the LHS label.
    Satisfied: both conditions are satisfied. Write Item B.
    Not satisfied: STOP. Adjust your Item C plan so the equation label is `focus_adjusted_total`.
    Return here after adjusting. Do not write Item B until the LHS label is confirmed.

Both conditions are satisfied. Write Item B.

**Item B -- Lens definition:**
- What does this focus mean for this specific topic against the named incumbent? [1-2 sentences]

**Item C -- Focus Economics:**
Compute the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost before writing the INERTIA table. Use focus_adjusted_total in every Do-nothing cost cell and in VERDICT's "Not building this means:" line. This is what makes the competitive calculation demonstrably different from a no-focus run against the named incumbent.

State the formula as a labeled arithmetic equation:

  base_cost (no-focus run value): [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint -- the named incumbent's workaround cost ignoring the focus lens; inferred from topic context]
  focus_adjustment (unit rate by focus type): [Concrete focus-specific liability the named incumbent carries:
    compliance focus: "audit exposure from incumbent's gap: +$X/sprint per open gap";
    stakeholders focus: "sign-off overhead in incumbent model: +N hrs/sprint per approval cycle";
    size focus: "scaling degradation at incumbent's limit: +N hrs/sprint per sprint at current growth rate";
    requirements focus: "+N hrs/sprint per uncovered requirement"; etc.]
  focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL per sprint]

Every downstream Do-nothing cost cell uses focus_adjusted_total. The formula is verifiable by inspection: subtracting base_cost from focus_adjusted_total equals focus_adjustment.

**Item D -- Failure-mode rejection:**
No section heading matching the focus dimension (e.g., "## COMPLIANCE", "## STAKEHOLDERS") will appear after AMENDMENTS. All focus content flows through the rows in Item A's table, using the economics from Item C's formula.
