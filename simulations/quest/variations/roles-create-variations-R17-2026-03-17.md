## roles-create R17 — Summary

| ID | Axis | Gate form | Est. score (v15/27) |
|----|------|-----------|---------------------|
| **V-01** | C-30 alone | thin condition, bare FAIL, **annotated PASS** | 24/27 = 98.89 |
| **V-02** | C-29 alone | thin condition, **annotated FAIL**, bare PASS | 23/27 = 98.52 |
| **V-03** | C-31 alone | **verbose condition**, bare FAIL, bare PASS | 23/27 = 98.52 |
| **V-04** | C-31 + C-30 | **verbose condition**, bare FAIL, **annotated PASS** | 22/27 = 98.15 |
| **V-05** | Full ceiling | thin condition, bare FAIL, bare PASS | 27/27 = 100.00 |

**Primary open question for R17:** Does C-34 correctly add exactly one new deduction on top of each R16 pattern, raising all non-ceiling scores from their v14 values?

**Predicted deduction escalation under v15:**
- C-30 alone: 2 → 3 (C-30 + C-32 + **C-34**)
- C-29 alone: 3 → 4 (C-29 + C-30 + C-32 + **C-34**)
- C-31 alone: 3 → 4 (C-31 + C-32 + C-33 + **C-34**)
- C-31 + C-30: 4 → 5 (C-30 + C-31 + C-32 + C-33 + **C-34**)

**Key asymmetry preserved:** V-02 and V-03 tie at 23/27 through orthogonal paths — cascade identity (C-29→C-30→C-32→C-34) vs double-conjunction identity (C-31→C-32+C-33→C-34). C-33 passes in V-02; C-29 passes in V-03.
34) under v15, up from 2 under v14? C-34 must fire because C-32 fails; C-33 passes because C-31 is clean. Score: 24/27 = 98.89.

2. **V-02** -- Does C-29 alone now cost 4 deductions (C-29 + C-30 + C-32 + C-34) under v15, up from 3 under v14? C-29 cascades to C-30, both fail, C-32 fails; C-34 fires. C-33 still passes (C-31 clean). Score: 23/27 = 98.52.

3. **V-03** -- Does C-31 alone now cost 4 deductions (C-31 + C-32 + C-33 + C-34) under v15, up from 3 under v14? C-31 breaks both C-32 and C-33 simultaneously; C-34 fires on top. Score: 23/27 = 98.52.

**Fourth question (combination, V-04):** Does C-31 + C-30 now cost 5 deductions (C-30 + C-31 + C-32 + C-33 + C-34) under v15, up from 4 under v14? Under v14 the pattern was 4 deductions; C-34 stacks on top because both C-32 and C-33 fail. Score: 22/27 = 98.15.

**Key structural prediction for R17:**

- V-02 and V-03 remain tied at 23/27, through the same orthogonal paths as in R16 (cascade identity vs double-conjunction identity), now with C-34 firing in both.
- V-01 moves to 24/27 (was 24/26 under v14). Annotated PASS branches are now a 3-deduction pattern, not 2.
- V-04 moves to 22/27 (was 22/26 under v14). The 5-deduction pattern is the deepest among single-and-two-failure combinations.

**Cascade asymmetry under v15 (predicted):**
- C-30 alone: 3 deductions (C-30 + C-32 + C-34) -- up from 2
- C-29 alone: 4 deductions (C-29 + C-30 cascade + C-32 + C-34) -- up from 3
- C-31 alone: 4 deductions (C-31 + C-32 + C-33 + C-34) -- up from 3
- C-31 + C-30: 5 deductions (C-31 + C-30 + C-32 + C-33 + C-34) -- up from 4

C-29 and C-31 remain tied in deduction count (4 each), through structurally distinct paths: C-29 breaks the gate annotation layer through cascade (C-30 -> C-32 -> C-34); C-31 breaks both layers simultaneously through the pivot (C-32 + C-33 -> C-34). Symmetry preserved under v15.

**Scoring formula (v15):** `(essential_passed x 12) + (recommended_passed x 15) + (aspirational_passed / 27 x 10)`. Denominator = 27. Per-criterion weight = 0.3704pt.

### V-01: C-30 Alone (C-34 via C-32, C-33 Passes)

**Axis:** Gate conditions use thin CONTRACT-citation form (C-31 pass). FAIL branches are bare verdict tokens (C-29 pass). PASS branches carry affirmation summaries restating the check in confirmation form (C-30 fail). Phase bodies are citation-only (C-25 pass, C-27 pass, C-28 pass). Thin phase bodies and checklist items (C-19 pass, C-20 pass). CONTRACTS in canonical first-citation order (C-26 pass).

**Hypothesis:** C-30 fail (annotated PASS branches) triggers C-32 fail (triple purity not achieved) which triggers C-34 fail (meta-conjunction broken). C-33 passes because C-31 passes (gate conditions are thin) and C-19 + C-20 pass (phase bodies and checklist items are thin citations). Exactly 3 deductions: C-30 + C-32 + C-34. Score: 24/27 = 98.89.

### CONTRACTS

The following contracts define all key invariants for this skill. All phases reference these by name. Rules are stated once, here, authoritatively.

---

#### CONTRACT: INPUT-ROUTING-RULES

Apply before mode detection. Classify the input:

| Pattern | Classification | Action |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Single word, no colon | BARE AREA | Ask "Which subrole in `{area}`? Provide `{area}:{subrole}` or a description." Stop. |
| More than one `:` | EXTRA COLONS | Use first two tokens as area:subrole. Notify user. Continue. |
| Natural language, no colon, no quotes, <= 4 words | VAGUE PHRASE | Ask "Did you mean `area:subrole`, a description in quotes, or interactive mode?" Stop. |
| No argument | EMPTY | Route to INTERACTIVE. Continue. |
| `word:word`, quoted string, or confirmed EMPTY | CLEAN INPUT | Continue to mode detection. |

---

#### CONTRACT: INTERACTIVE-HOLD

These are categorical prohibitions, not preferences:
- **Do not generate any content after receiving only one or two answers.**
- **Do not produce a draft, stub, or partial frontmatter mid-conversation.**
- **Do not proceed until all three answers are confirmed.**

Three required questions, in sequence:
1. "What area? (e.g., `backend`, `design`, `data`)"
2. "What subrole name? (e.g., `healthcare`, `payments`, `accessibility`)"
3. "One sentence describing what this role focuses on."

---

#### CONTRACT: FIELD-REGISTER

| Field | Register | Good Example | Anti-Pattern |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| archetype | Check existing roles in the area first; use their value | Found `craft` in 3 existing backend roles -> use `craft` | Applying `craft` or `process` without checking |
| orientation.frame | First-person observational: how this role perceives its domain | "Sees every patient data boundary as a PHI exposure surface requiring documented access justification before approval." | "Reviews healthcare data compliance for the team." |
| orientation.serves | Third-person recipient: who benefits and why; must name a specific beneficiary | "Product teams shipping to regulated healthcare markets: reduces compliance review cycles by surfacing HIPAA gaps before code review." | "Serves the team by ensuring compliance." |
| lens.verify | Boolean check naming specific artifact, state, or config; answerable yes/no; >= 4 items | "Is the audit log retention period set to >= 6 years for PHI access events?" | "Check audit log configuration." |
| expertise.depth | Specific domain knowledge | "HIPAA Security Rule requirements for PHI at rest and in transit, BAA obligations, breach notification timelines" | "Broad understanding of healthcare compliance" |

---

#### CONTRACT: COLUMN-HEADER

Body table column headers must use domain vocabulary.

| Verdict | Example |
|---------|---------|
| FAIL | `\| Component \| Purpose \| Notes \|` |
| FAIL | `\| Item \| Description \| Impact \|` |
| FAIL | `\| Area \| Value \| Consideration \|` |
| PASS | `\| Regulation / Scope / Enforcement Body \|` (compliance) |
| PASS | `\| API Surface / Side Effect / Auth Requirement \|` (backend) |
| PASS | `\| Data Source / Latency Class / SLA \|` (data) |
| PASS | `\| GL Account / Journal Entry Type / Impact \|` (finance) |
| PASS | `\| Asset Type / Accessibility Rule / WCAG Level \|` (design) |

Rule: generic headers (Entity, Item, Area, Purpose, Description, Notes, Value, Consideration) = FAIL regardless of row content.

---

#### CONTRACT: INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE

Complete fill-in template. Substitute all `{area}` slots. Do not leave literal `{area}` in the written file.

```yaml

    - "Is the cost of migrating existing {area} work to the new approach documented?"
    - "Are the failure modes of the proposed change listed alongside its benefits?"
    - "Is there a rollback path if the new approach underperforms?"
    - "Has the team that will live with this change been consulted?"

-> **Gate 2a [H]:** INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE -- slot substitution completeness. PASS: All `{area}` slots confirmed substituted with actual area value. / FAIL
-> **Gate 2b:** INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE -- output path. PASS: Companion output path confirmed as `.craft/roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md`. / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 3 -- Generate Frontmatter

CONTRACT: FIELD-REGISTER applied. All 12 frontmatter fields generated for `.craft/roles/{area}/{subrole}.md`.

-> **Gate 3a [B]:** FIELD-REGISTER -- frontmatter completeness. PASS: All 12 frontmatter fields confirmed present and correctly typed. / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 4 -- Generate Body

CONTRACT: COLUMN-HEADER applied. Body written: `## {Subrole} Domain` heading + domain specializations table, minimum 3 rows.

-> **Gate 4a:** body -- domain specializations table present. PASS: Domain specializations table confirmed present in body. / FAIL
-> **Gate 4b [F]:** COLUMN-HEADER -- body table domain vocabulary. PASS: Column headers confirmed as domain-specific vocabulary with no generic terms. / FAIL
-> **Gate 4c:** body -- row count minimum. PASS: Table confirmed >= 3 domain-specific rows present. / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 5 -- Pre-Write Confirmation

CONTRACT: AUDIT-CHECKLIST confirmation. All items have been gated at their respective phases. Confirm each is resolved:

```
[A] Path correctness: .craft/roles/{area}/{subrole}.md confirmed? ___
[B] FIELD-REGISTER -- frontmatter completeness -- confirmed Gate 3a? ___
[C] FIELD-REGISTER -- orientation.frame -- confirmed Gate 3b? ___
[D] FIELD-REGISTER -- orientation.serves -- confirmed Gate 3c? ___
[E] FIELD-REGISTER -- lens.verify -- confirmed Gate 3d? ___

2. Main role: `.craft/roles/{area}/{subrole}.md`

Confirm both paths in output.

---

### V-02: C-29 Alone (C-34 via C-32 Cascade, C-33 Passes)

**Axis:** Gate conditions use thin CONTRACT-citation form (C-31 pass). FAIL branches carry correction directives (C-29 fail). PASS branches are bare verdict tokens (C-30 fails by hard cascade from C-29). Phase bodies are citation-only (C-19 pass, C-20 pass, C-25 pass, C-27 pass, C-28 pass). CONTRACTS in canonical order (C-26 pass).

**Hypothesis:** C-29 fail (annotated FAIL branches) triggers hard cascade to C-30 fail; C-32 fails (triple purity broken); C-34 fires (C-32 fails, meta-conjunction broken). C-33 passes because C-31 passes (thin conditions) and C-19 + C-20 pass (citation-only surfaces). Exactly 4 deductions: C-29 + C-30 + C-32 + C-34. Score: 23/27 = 98.52.

Confirm both paths in output.

---

### V-03: C-31 Alone (C-34 via Double Conjunction: C-32 + C-33)

**Axis:** Gate conditions enumerate rule-level specifics from CONTRACT blocks (C-31 fail). FAIL branches are bare verdict tokens (C-29 pass). PASS branches are bare verdict tokens (C-30 pass). Phase bodies are citation-only (C-19 pass, C-20 pass, C-25 pass, C-27 pass, C-28 pass). CONTRACTS in canonical order (C-26 pass).

**Hypothesis:** C-31 fail (verbose gate conditions) simultaneously breaks C-32 (triple purity: C-31 is a prerequisite) and C-33 (no-restatement surface closure: C-31 is a prerequisite) -- because C-31 is the shared prerequisite for both conjunctions. C-34 fires because both C-32 and C-33 fail. C-29 and C-30 pass (bare verdict branches throughout). Exactly 4 deductions: C-31 + C-32 + C-33 + C-34. Score: 23/27 = 98.52.

#### CONTRACT: AUDIT-CHECKLIST

Pre-declared obligations. Items name the CONTRACT block and validation scope only -- no rule enumeration. Declaration names the gate that executes each item (forward); each gate cites the declaration ID it validates (backward). Fully bidirectional.

| ID | Criterion | Gated At |
|----|-----------|----------|
| A | Path correctness -- `.craft/roles/{area}/{subrole}.md` | Phase 6 setup |
| B | FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- frontmatter field completeness | Phase 3 Gate 3a |

---

### PHASES

---

#### PHASE 0 -- Input Guard

CONTRACT: INPUT-ROUTING-RULES applied. BARE AREA and VAGUE PHRASE inputs halt for clarification; Phase 1 is not entered until a clean input is confirmed.

-> **Gate 0 [G]:** Input pattern identified as one of five recognized classes: BARE AREA (single word, no colon), EXTRA COLONS (two or more colons), VAGUE PHRASE (natural language, <= 4 words, no colon or quotes), EMPTY (no argument), or CLEAN INPUT (`word:word` form, quoted string, or confirmed EMPTY). PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 1 -- Mode Detection

CONTRACT: INTERACTIVE-HOLD applied when EMPTY input confirmed. NAME-ONLY (`area:subrole`): extract area and subrole directly. DESCRIPTION (quoted string): derive area and subrole from natural language. INTERACTIVE (empty / confirmed EMPTY): all three answers required before Phase 2.

-> **Gate 1:** area and subrole tokens are non-empty strings extracted from the input. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 2 -- Inertia-Advocate Check

CONTRACT: INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE applied when companion is absent. Check `.craft/roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md`. If ABSENT: generate companion content, substitute all `{area}` slots, hold in working memory. If PRESENT: continue to Phase 3.

-> **Gate 2a [H]:** All `{area}` placeholder slots in the companion file have been substituted with the actual area name string. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 2b:** Companion output path is exactly `.craft/roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md` with `{area}` replaced by the actual area name. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 3 -- Generate Frontmatter

CONTRACT: FIELD-REGISTER applied. All 12 frontmatter fields generated for `.craft/roles/{area}/{subrole}.md`.

-> **Gate 3a [B]:** All 12 frontmatter fields are present: name, version, archetype, orientation.frame, orientation.serves, lens.verify (list), lens.simplify (list), expertise.depth, expertise.relevance, scope, collaborates_with, artifacts, and workflow. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 3b [C]:** orientation.frame is written in first-person observational register -- the role describes what it sees, not what it does for others. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 3c [D]:** orientation.serves names a specific beneficiary and states the concrete benefit they receive, not a description of the role's own activities. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 3d [E]:** lens.verify contains >= 4 items, each phrased as a boolean check naming a specific artifact, state, or configuration value answerable yes/no. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 3e:** No placeholder tokens (`{area}`, `{subrole}`, `[fill in]`, `TBD`) remain anywhere in frontmatter. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 4 -- Generate Body

CONTRACT: COLUMN-HEADER applied. Body written: `## {Subrole} Domain` heading + domain specializations table, minimum 3 rows.

-> **Gate 4a:** Body contains at least one markdown table with a header row and >= 3 data rows. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 4b [F]:** All column headers in the domain specializations table use domain-specific vocabulary -- no generic terms such as Entity, Item, Area, Purpose, Description, Notes, Value, or Consideration. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 4c:** Domain specializations table contains >= 3 rows populated with domain-specific content. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 5 -- Pre-Write Confirmation

CONTRACT: AUDIT-CHECKLIST confirmation. All items have been gated at their respective phases. Confirm each is resolved:

```
[A] Path correctness: .craft/roles/{area}/{subrole}.md confirmed? ___
[B] FIELD-REGISTER -- frontmatter completeness -- confirmed Gate 3a? ___
[C] FIELD-REGISTER -- orientation.frame -- confirmed Gate 3b? ___
[D] FIELD-REGISTER -- orientation.serves -- confirmed Gate 3c? ___
[E] FIELD-REGISTER -- lens.verify -- confirmed Gate 3d? ___
[F] COLUMN-HEADER -- body table -- confirmed Gate 4b? ___
[G] INPUT-ROUTING-RULES -- confirmed Gate 0? ___
[H] If inertia-advocate generated: INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE -- confirmed Gate 2a? ___ (N/A if already existed)
```

All items must show YES (or N/A for H). Any NO = identify the failed gate, fix, re-check the phase gate, return here.

---

#### PHASE 6 -- Write Files

Write in order:
1. If companion generated in Phase 2: `.craft/roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md`
2. Main role: `.craft/roles/{area}/{subrole}.md`

Confirm both paths in output.

---

### V-04: C-31 + C-30 (C-34 via Both Conjunctions: Maximum Non-Ceiling Deductions)

**Axis:** Gate conditions enumerate rule-level specifics from CONTRACT blocks (C-31 fail). FAIL branches are bare verdict tokens (C-29 pass). PASS branches carry affirmation summaries echoing the verbose gate condition (C-30 fail; substrate link confirmed by R15: verbose conditions supply the language PASS branches echo). Phase bodies are citation-only (C-19 pass, C-20 pass, C-25 pass, C-27 pass, C-28 pass). CONTRACTS in canonical order (C-26 pass).

**Hypothesis:** C-31 fail breaks both C-32 and C-33. C-30 fail additionally contributes to C-32 (already failing from C-31). C-34 fires because both C-32 and C-33 fail. C-29 passes (bare FAIL branches). Exactly 5 deductions: C-30 + C-31 + C-32 + C-33 + C-34. Score: 22/27 = 98.15.

### CONTRACTS

The following contracts define all key invariants for this skill. All phases reference these by name. Rules are stated once, here, authoritatively.

---

#### CONTRACT: INPUT-ROUTING-RULES

Apply before mode detection. Classify the input:

| Pattern | Classification | Action |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Single word, no colon | BARE AREA | Ask "Which subrole in `{area}`? Provide `{area}:{subrole}` or a description." Stop. |
| More than one `:` | EXTRA COLONS | Use first two tokens as area:subrole. Notify user. Continue. |
| Natural language, no colon, no quotes, <= 4 words | VAGUE PHRASE | Ask "Did you mean `area:subrole`, a description in quotes, or interactive mode?" Stop. |
| No argument | EMPTY | Route to INTERACTIVE. Continue. |
| `word:word`, quoted string, or confirmed EMPTY | CLEAN INPUT | Continue to mode detection. |

---

#### CONTRACT: INTERACTIVE-HOLD

These are categorical prohibitions, not preferences:
- **Do not generate any content after receiving only one or two answers.**
- **Do not produce a draft, stub, or partial frontmatter mid-conversation.**
- **Do not proceed until all three answers are confirmed.**

Three required questions, in sequence:
1. "What area? (e.g., `backend`, `design`, `data`)"
2. "What subrole name? (e.g., `healthcare`, `payments`, `accessibility`)"
3. "One sentence describing what this role focuses on."

[C] FIELD-REGISTER -- orientation.frame -- confirmed Gate 3b? ___
[D] FIELD-REGISTER -- orientation.serves -- confirmed Gate 3c? ___
[E] FIELD-REGISTER -- lens.verify -- confirmed Gate 3d? ___
[F] COLUMN-HEADER -- body table -- confirmed Gate 4b? ___
[G] INPUT-ROUTING-RULES -- confirmed Gate 0? ___
[H] If inertia-advocate generated: INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE -- confirmed Gate 2a? ___ (N/A if already existed)

Confirm both paths in output.

---

### V-05: Full Ceiling (27/27 = 100.00 under v15)

**Axis:** All gate annotation surfaces simultaneously clean: thin conditions (C-31 pass), bare FAIL branches (C-29 pass), bare PASS branches (C-30 pass). Gate triple purity achieved (C-32 pass). No-restatement surface closure achieved across phase bodies, checklist items, and gate conditions (C-33 pass). Meta-conjunction achieved (C-34 pass). Identical gate discipline to R16 V-05; denominator advances to 27.

**Hypothesis:** C-32 pass (C-29 + C-30 + C-31 all clean) and C-33 pass (C-19 + C-20 + C-31 all clean) simultaneously implies C-34 pass. C-34 is the ceiling criterion; a skill that passes C-34 has satisfied every structural criterion in the aspirational tier under v15. Score: 27/27 = 100.00.

#### PHASE 5 -- Pre-Write Confirmation

CONTRACT: AUDIT-CHECKLIST confirmation. All items have been gated at their respective phases. Confirm each is resolved:

```
[A] Path correctness: .craft/roles/{area}/{subrole}.md confirmed? ___
[B] FIELD-REGISTER -- frontmatter completeness -- confirmed Gate 3a? ___
[C] FIELD-REGISTER -- orientation.frame -- confirmed Gate 3b? ___
[D] FIELD-REGISTER -- orientation.serves -- confirmed Gate 3c? ___
[E] FIELD-REGISTER -- lens.verify -- confirmed Gate 3d? ___
[F] COLUMN-HEADER -- body table -- confirmed Gate 4b? ___
[G] INPUT-ROUTING-RULES -- confirmed Gate 0? ___
[H] If inertia-advocate generated: INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE -- confirmed Gate 2a? ___ (N/A if already existed)
```

All items must show YES (or N/A for H). Any NO = identify the failed gate, fix, re-check the phase gate, return here.

#### PHASE 6 -- Write Files

Write in order:
1. If companion generated in Phase 2: `.craft/roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md`
2. Main role: `.craft/roles/{area}/{subrole}.md`

Confirm both paths in output.
