## R13 Variations -- V-61 through V-65

| # | Label | Axis | Key change | Predicted |
|---|-------|------|------------|-----------|
| **V-61** | Descriptor-named gate | C-40 naming form | Gate uses functional descriptors ("duality framing," "audit format," "derivation direction") instead of "Axis N" ordinals; partial-failure declared | 400 or 395 |
| **V-62** | Single-axis partial naming | C-40 PARTIAL -- fewer axes | Gate names only Axis 3 by label; Axis 1/2 absent from gate; partial-failure declared for Axis 3 omission | 395 |
| **V-63** | Full naming, no partial-failure | C-40 PARTIAL -- no impossibility | Gate names all 3 by "Axis N"; no statement that partial satisfaction fails the gate | 395 |
| **V-64** | Ceiling (V-60 exact) | C-40 baseline | V-60 verbatim: all 3 named + partial-failure declared | 400 |
| **V-65** | Gate in label only | C-40 placement | Block gate instruction is minimal; per-axis enumeration + impossibility live only in the required architecture label | 390 or 395 |

**Structural questions:**
- **Q1 (V-61 vs V-64):** Does "Axis N" ordinal form matter, or do functional descriptors satisfy "names each axis by label"?
- **Q2 (V-62):** Does 1-of-3 axis naming + partial-failure declaration earn C-40 PARTIAL (5 pts)?
- **Q3 (V-63):** Does all-3-axes named without impossibility declaration earn PARTIAL -- or FAIL? (The rubric's two listed PARTIAL conditions don't cover this combination.)
- **Q4 (V-64):** Does V-60's exact gate earn C-40 PASS (10 pts) at 400/400 ceiling?
- **Q5 (V-65):** Does C-40 require the gate to be inside the block instruction, or does a per-axis gate in the produced architecture label satisfy the criterion?
t not this combination -- expected PARTIAL as genuine attempt, but could be FAIL.
- **Q4 (V-64):** Does V-60's gate earn C-40 PASS (10 pts), bringing the ceiling to 400/400?
- **Q5 (V-65):** Does C-40 require the gate to be expressed within the block gate instruction itself, or does a per-axis gate in the required architecture label satisfy the criterion?

The key isolation: V-62 and V-63 are the clean single-axis tests for the two explicit PARTIAL conditions. V-61 probes naming form. V-64 confirms the ceiling. V-65 probes gate placement.

---

### V-61: Descriptor-Named Gate (C-40 naming form)

**Axis:** AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block gate condition uses functional content descriptors
("duality framing," "audit format," "derivation direction") instead of "Axis 1/2/3" ordinal
labels. All three constraints are named individually and partial-failure is declared -- but
via descriptor rather than axis number.
**Hypothesis:** C-40 earns PASS (10 pts) if "names each axis by label" accepts functional
descriptors as valid labels. If ordinal "Axis N" form is required specifically, earns PARTIAL
(5 pts). C-38 and C-39 unchanged (PASS). Total predicted: 400/400 or 395/400.
**Change from V-60:** Block gate condition replaces bullet-per-"Axis N" enumeration with
bullet-per-descriptor enumeration; partial-failure statement uses descriptor labels ("A block
containing the duality framing and audit format but omitting the derivation direction fails
this gate"). Required architecture label updated to match. All phases identical to V-60.

## Citation Architecture

Read this section once, in full, before Phase 1 begins. This architecture declares every
named artifact, exact-copy requirement, and derivation direction constraint before any
production phase begins. The three structural constraints governing citation chain integrity
are declared in the AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block below. Read the block before Phase 1.

**Named artifacts, required outputs, and verification:**

| # | Phase / Position | Artifact or output | Downstream consumer | Requirement |
|---|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Phase 1 | "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED" | Phase 4 methodology traces | Exact-copy: copy artifact name, not "Phase 1" |
| 2 | Phase 2 | "PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED" | Phase 5(2) structural persistence | Exact-copy: copy artifact name, not "Phase 2" |
| 3 | Phase 5(3) | "LEVER POINT: [label]" | CCV (5); AMEND(d) | Exact-copy: copy the exact label string verbatim. AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor FROM the L3 Evidence column of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit -- the audit is the derivation authority; do not construct from Phase 5(3) and retroactively confirm. |
| 4 | Phase 6 Part B | "TRAJECTORY VERDICT: [direction]" | Phase 7; CCV (6) | Exact-copy: copy the exact direction word |
| 5 | After Phase 7, before CCV | CITATION CHAIN COMPLETENESS AUDIT | Self-verifying | See AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block below; CHAIN COMPLETE gate before CCV |

---

**AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED**

This block declares three co-resident constraints. A model reading this block before Phase 1
knows all three architecture constraints before executing any phase. All three constraints are
required content of this block. A block missing any constraint is an incomplete architecture
declaration.

**Duality framing:** This output has two structural artifacts serving distinct and
non-substitutable roles. The Citation Architecture preamble (rows 1--5 above) is declarative:
it specifies what will be produced and how it will be cited before any production phase
begins. The Citation Chain Completeness Audit is confirmatory: it verifies what was produced
after all production phases are complete. These roles are structurally distinct. The preamble
cannot confirm chain integrity because it precedes production. The audit cannot declare
artifact names and exact-copy requirements because those must be known before Phase 1.
Neither artifact substitutes for or subsumes the other's function.

**Audit format:** The Citation Chain Completeness Audit (row 5) must use the following
5-column structure for all four links: Source artifact | Consumer site | Evidence [write
actual downstream cite text verbatim -- for L3, write the exact "Lever anchor: [LEVER POINT
label]" text that will appear in AMEND(d); for L1/L2/L4, write the phrase from the consuming
section that names the source artifact character-for-character; write the actual text
produced, not a description or summary; the Evidence cell must be populated with real text,
not a placeholder] | Link type [Reference-chain if Evidence reproduces source artifact label
verbatim; Description-chain if Evidence describes or paraphrases] | Verdict [PASS for
Reference-chain; CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE for Description-chain -- not "weaker" or
"incomplete"]. Close with "CHAIN COMPLETE: all four links are reference chains" or "CHAIN
BREAK: [list link IDs] -- return to Phase [X] before proceeding."

**Derivation direction:** AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor from the L3 Evidence column
of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit. Phase 5(3) is a prohibited derivation source for
the lever anchor in AMEND(d). CCV is a prohibited derivation source for the lever anchor in
AMEND(d). The L3 Evidence cell is the one permitted source. AMEND(d) does not construct the
anchor independently and retroactively confirm; it copies from L3 Evidence directly. This
derivation direction and these prohibitions are declared at the architecture-read boundary so
that the full constraint -- required source AND forbidden sources -- is known before any
production phase begins.

Do not proceed to Phase 1 until all of the following are confirmed above:
- "AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED" is written on its own line.
- Duality framing (declarative vs. confirmatory structural roles) is present.
- Audit format (5-column structure with Evidence-column semantics) is present.
- Derivation direction (L3 Evidence required; Phase 5(3) and CCV prohibited) is present.
A block containing the duality framing and audit format but omitting the derivation direction
fails this gate.

---

**Exact-copy rule:** A downstream cite that describes or paraphrases is a paraphrase chain.
A downstream cite that reproduces the artifact label character-for-character is a reference
chain. Only reference chains satisfy the citation requirements.

**Structural prohibition:** Do not produce output in any phase that would require a downstream
phase to paraphrase rather than copy. Return to the phase and emit the required artifact.

**Required architecture label:**

> "CITATION ARCHITECTURE DECLARED. This architecture declares all artifact production
> requirements (rows 1--4), the Citation Chain Completeness Audit requirement (row 5), and
> the AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block with three co-resident constraints: duality framing
> (declarative vs. confirmatory roles), audit format (5-column structure with Evidence
> semantics), derivation direction (L3 Evidence required; Phase 5(3) and CCV prohibited). A
> block omitting the derivation direction fails its gate. All named artifacts must be produced
> exactly as declared. All downstream cites must copy upstream labels verbatim. AMEND(d) must
> derive its lever anchor from the L3 Evidence column -- not from Phase 5(3) or CCV. The
> audit must be produced after Phase 7 and must declare CHAIN COMPLETE before the CCV gate
> may proceed."

Do not proceed to Phase 1 until this label is written.

---

## Phase 1 -- Scoring Methodology Declaration

Before analyzing any persona, declare the inertia scoring framework.

**Dimension weights:**

| Dimension | Weight (High / Medium / Low) | Why this weight |
|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------|

Dimensions: Workaround satisfaction / Switching cost / Habit lock-in / Social proof requirement
/ Learning curve.

**Score thresholds:**

- **Critical:** [dimension combinations]
- **High:** [combinations]
- **Medium:** [combinations]
- **Low:** [condition all dimensions must satisfy]

**Required infrastructure label** (Citation Architecture row 1):

> "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED. All per-persona methodology traces in Phase 4 must cite
> this Phase 1 output by reference -- naming the specific dimension weights and tier thresholds
> declared above. Traces that reference dimension values without citing thresholds, or
> thresholds without dimension values, fail the per-score trace requirement."

Do not proceed to Phase 2 until written.

---

## Phase 2 -- Persona and Competitive Inventory

Identify 2--4 named personas. For each, treat the current solution as a named competitor.

- Name and role (specific)
- Current solution (named tool or method)
- Outcome the current solution delivers

**Competitive strength inventory per persona:**

| Dimension | Advantage | Durability |
|-----------|-----------|------------|

Durability must name a structural constraint. **Familiarity is not durability.** Structural
constraints: technical, organizational, integration-based, or switching-cost-based.

**Completeness gate:** For each persona: (1) all three fields present; (2) no Durability uses
familiarity/habit -- replace with structural constraint; (3) Dimension names a specific axis.
Do not proceed to Phase 3 until all personas pass all three checks.

**Required inventory label** (Citation Architecture row 2):

> "PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED. Phase 5(2) structural persistence analysis must cite this
> Phase 2 output by reference -- naming the specific Durability property by its Phase 2 label.
> A structural persistence claim that does not name the PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED artifact
> is a paraphrase chain, not a reference chain."

Do not proceed to Phase 3 until written.

---

## Phase 3 -- Inertia Dimension Analysis

| Persona | Workaround satisfaction (H/M/L) | Satisfaction basis (ref. Phase 2) | Switching cost (quantified) | Habit lock-in | Social proof threshold (named condition) | Learning curve |
|---------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|

Switching cost: time, steps, rating 1--10. Qualitative-only fails.
Social proof threshold: named count, role, or condition. Binary Y/N fails.

---

## Phase 4 -- Per-Persona Inertia Scores

| Persona | Score | Methodology trace |
|---------|-------|-------------------|

Methodology trace: (a) name dimension values from Phase 3 + (b) state Phase 1 threshold
satisfied. Cite Phase 1 by copying "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED" (Citation Architecture
row 1). Do not write "Phase 1." Write the artifact name. Every persona scored individually.

---

## Phase 5 -- Kill Barrier: Four-Part Causal Analysis with Reselection Gate

**KILL BARRIER** -- four labeled, distinct sub-parts. Do not merge any two.

**(1) Barrier definition** -- observable adoption friction; state the competitive dimension.
Do not include cause.

**(2) Structural persistence** -- why the barrier persists structurally. Cite PERSONA
INVENTORY DECLARED (Citation Architecture row 2): name the specific Durability property by
its Phase 2 label. A claim without naming the PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED artifact is a
paraphrase chain.

**(3) Intervention target** -- specific lever point. Name the target, not the intervention.

**Required lever label** (Citation Architecture row 3):

> **LEVER POINT: [exact label -- 3--7 words]**

**Falsifiability test:**

> "At T=6mo, the absence of this lever would be observable as: [specific observable
> behavioral or measurable condition]."

Replace Part (3) and repeat if you cannot produce a specific observable condition. Do not
write Part (4) until the test passes.

**(4) Lever efficacy** -- why addressing (3) resolves (2). Explain causally. Reference (2)
by name.

**Temporal persistence confirmation:**

| T=0 exists? | T=18mo persists without structural intervention? |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| YES / NO | YES / NO |

Both must be YES to qualify. If either is NO, return to the top of this phase.

**CONFIRMED KILL BARRIER.** Name the most exposed persona.

---

## Phase 6 -- Adoption Timeline and Kill-Barrier Trajectory Verdict

**Part A disqualifier (required before grid):**

> "This Part A grid captures per-persona trajectory only. It does not satisfy the
> kill-barrier trajectory verdict requirement. That output belongs exclusively to Part B."

| Persona | T=0 | T=6mo | T=18mo | Trajectory | Driver of change |
|---------|-----|-------|--------|------------|-----------------|

At least one trajectory non-flat. T=6mo and T=18mo cannot copy T=0 without a stated reason.

**Part B: KILL-BARRIER TRAJECTORY VERDICT**

**Trajectory direction:** [Resolving / Stable / Worsening]

**Structural reasoning:** [Reference the structural persistence property from Phase 5(2)
by name. Argue from mechanism, not from the per-persona grid.]

**Relationship to Part A:** [Alignment or divergence -- which structural property drives both,
or why they differ.]

**Required trajectory label** (Citation Architecture row 4):

> **TRAJECTORY VERDICT: [exact direction word -- Resolving, Stable, or Worsening]**

Do not proceed to Phase 7 until written.

---

## Phase 7 -- Overall Adoption Inertia Risk

Verdict: Low / Medium / High / Critical.

- Score distribution (e.g., "2 High, 1 Critical")
- Kill-barrier trajectory: copy the exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label (Citation Architecture
  row 4). Do not write "Phase 6 Part B." Write the exact label.
- Competitive summary: kill barrier dimension + Phase 2 structural durability basis
- 1--2 sentence rationale tying score distribution, trajectory, and confirmed kill barrier

---

## Citation Chain Completeness Audit

**(Citation Architecture row 5 -- required before CCV)**

Produce the 5-column audit table using the audit format constraint from AUDIT ARCHITECTURE
DECLARED above. For each link, write the actual downstream cite text in the Evidence column.
Assign Link type and Verdict from that evidence.

| Link | Source artifact | Consumer site | Evidence (write actual downstream cite text) | Link type | Verdict |
|------|----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| L1 | [exact Phase 1 artifact name] | Phase 4 methodology traces | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 4 trace that names the Phase 1 artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L2 | [exact Phase 2 artifact name] | Phase 5(2) structural persistence | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 5(2) that names the Phase 2 artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L3 | [exact LEVER POINT label] | AMEND(d) lever anchor | [write the exact text that WILL appear in AMEND(d)'s "Lever anchor:" field -- this is a forward commitment; AMEND(d) copies from this cell only; Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited sources per the derivation direction constraint] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L4 | [exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label] | Phase 7 trajectory cite | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 7 that names the Phase 6 Part B artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |

**Verdict rules:**
- Reference-chain: Evidence reproduces Source artifact label verbatim. Verdict: PASS.
- Description-chain: Evidence describes or paraphrases. Verdict: CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE --
  not "weaker," not "incomplete."
- L3 forward commitment: the text you write in the L3 Evidence cell is the source AMEND(d)
  copies from. Write the exact "Lever anchor: [LEVER POINT label]" text as it will appear.
  Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited per the derivation direction constraint.

**Required aggregate declaration on its own line:**

> "CHAIN COMPLETE: all four links are reference chains."

-- OR --

> "CHAIN BREAK: [list link IDs with CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] -- return to Phase [X] and
> produce the required named artifact before re-auditing."

**Gate rule:** Do not proceed to CCV until CHAIN COMPLETE is written. If CHAIN BREAK, correct
and re-audit.

---

## Citation Chain Verification

Before writing AMEND, complete all six fields with named text.

1. **Phase 1 artifact name:** [exact text produced in Phase 1]
2. **Phase 2 artifact name:** [exact text produced in Phase 2]
3. **Phase 4 citation:** [exact artifact name from (1) as it appears in Phase 4 traces]
4. **Phase 5(2) citation:** [exact artifact name from (2) as it appears in Phase 5(2)]
5. **Phase 5(3) lever label:** [exact LEVER POINT label]
6. **Phase 6 Part B trajectory label:** [exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label]

A field containing "Phase X" or "see above" without the actual artifact name fails.
Correct the upstream phase before proceeding.

---

## AMEND -- Focus, Quantify, Confirm

**Focus persona:** [name -- most exposed to confirmed kill barrier]

**Switching cost (sharpened):** [most precise quantified value]

**Kill barrier for this persona:** [one sentence -- competitive dimension, most acute because]

**Mitigation with full causal chain:**

> **(a) Intervention:** [one concrete action]
>
> **(b) Root cause addressed:** [name the structural condition from Phase 5(2)]
>
> **(c) Causal mechanism:** [why this lever reaches the structural condition in (2). Reference
> the Phase 5(3) lever point by name.]
>
> **(d) Confirmation signal at T=6mo:**
>
> Locate the L3 row of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit above. The Evidence column of
> that row contains the lever anchor text you pre-committed to when you wrote the audit. That
> cell is the derivation authority per the derivation direction constraint of AUDIT
> ARCHITECTURE DECLARED. Copy its contents exactly, character-for-character, into the "Lever
> anchor:" field below. Do not reconstruct the anchor from Phase 5(3). Do not use CCV step
> (5) as the source. Both are prohibited derivation sources per the derivation direction
> constraint. The L3 Evidence cell is the one source.
>
> "Lever anchor: [copy the exact text from the L3 Evidence cell of the Citation Chain
> Completeness Audit -- do not reconstruct from Phase 5(3) or CCV]."
>
> [At T=6mo, the absence of this lever would be observable as: [specific falsifiable
> behavioral or measurable condition]. Must be possible to observe it as absent.]

The lever anchor must reproduce the L3 Evidence cell text exactly. The AMEND section is not
complete without the lever anchor and the observable condition.

---

### V-62: Single-Axis Partial Naming (C-40 PARTIAL -- fewer than 3 axes)

**Axis:** AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block gate condition names only Axis 3 by its "Axis N"
label; Axis 1 and Axis 2 are present as block content but absent from the gate enumeration.
Gate declares that a block omitting Axis 3 fails -- satisfying the partial-failure declaration
but naming only 1 of 3 axes.
**Hypothesis:** C-40 earns PARTIAL (5 pts). Gate has partial-failure declaration but names
only 1 of 3 axes. Confirms the explicit PARTIAL condition: "gate naming fewer than three axes
earns PARTIAL." C-38 and C-39 unchanged (PASS). Total predicted: 395/400.
**Change from V-60:** Gate condition replaces the four-bullet enumeration (three "Axis N"
checks plus impossibility statement) with a two-element form: general completeness requirement
plus a single "Axis 3 omission fails" statement naming only Axis 3. Required architecture
label updated to name only Axis 3 in its gate reference.

## Citation Architecture

Read this section once, in full, before Phase 1 begins. This architecture declares every
named artifact, exact-copy requirement, and derivation direction constraint before any
production phase begins. The three structural axes governing citation chain integrity are
declared in the AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block below. Read the block before Phase 1.

**Named artifacts, required outputs, and verification:**

| # | Phase / Position | Artifact or output | Downstream consumer | Requirement |
|---|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Phase 1 | "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED" | Phase 4 methodology traces | Exact-copy: copy artifact name, not "Phase 1" |
| 2 | Phase 2 | "PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED" | Phase 5(2) structural persistence | Exact-copy: copy artifact name, not "Phase 2" |
| 3 | Phase 5(3) | "LEVER POINT: [label]" | CCV (5); AMEND(d) | Exact-copy: copy the exact label string verbatim. AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor FROM the L3 Evidence column of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit -- the audit is the derivation authority; do not construct from Phase 5(3) and retroactively confirm. |
| 4 | Phase 6 Part B | "TRAJECTORY VERDICT: [direction]" | Phase 7; CCV (6) | Exact-copy: copy the exact direction word |
| 5 | After Phase 7, before CCV | CITATION CHAIN COMPLETENESS AUDIT | Self-verifying | See AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block below (Axes 1--3); CHAIN COMPLETE gate before CCV |

---

**AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED**

This block declares three co-resident constraints. A model reading this block before Phase 1
knows all three architecture constraints before executing any phase. All three axes are
required content of this block. A block missing any axis is an incomplete architecture
declaration.

**Axis 1 -- Duality framing:** This output has two structural artifacts serving distinct and
non-substitutable roles. The Citation Architecture preamble (rows 1--5 above) is declarative:
it specifies what will be produced and how it will be cited before any production phase
begins. The Citation Chain Completeness Audit is confirmatory: it verifies what was produced
after all production phases are complete. These roles are structurally distinct. The preamble
cannot confirm chain integrity because it precedes production. The audit cannot declare
artifact names and exact-copy requirements because those must be known before Phase 1.
Neither artifact substitutes for or subsumes the other's function.

**Axis 2 -- Audit format:** The Citation Chain Completeness Audit (row 5) must use the
following 5-column structure for all four links: Source artifact | Consumer site | Evidence
[write actual downstream cite text verbatim -- for L3, write the exact "Lever anchor:
[LEVER POINT label]" text that will appear in AMEND(d); for L1/L2/L4, write the phrase from
the consuming section that names the source artifact character-for-character; write the actual
text produced, not a description or summary; the Evidence cell must be populated with real
text, not a placeholder] | Link type [Reference-chain if Evidence reproduces source artifact
label verbatim; Description-chain if Evidence describes or paraphrases] | Verdict [PASS for
Reference-chain; CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE for Description-chain -- not "weaker" or
"incomplete"]. Close with "CHAIN COMPLETE: all four links are reference chains" or "CHAIN
BREAK: [list link IDs] -- return to Phase [X] before proceeding."

**Axis 3 -- Derivation direction:** AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor from the L3
Evidence column of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit. Phase 5(3) is a prohibited
derivation source for the lever anchor in AMEND(d). CCV is a prohibited derivation source
for the lever anchor in AMEND(d). The L3 Evidence cell is the one permitted source. AMEND(d)
does not construct the anchor independently and retroactively confirm; it copies from L3
Evidence directly. This derivation direction and these prohibitions are declared at the
architecture-read boundary so that the full constraint -- required source AND forbidden
sources -- is known before any production phase begins.

Do not proceed to Phase 1 until "AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED" is written on its own line
above and the block contains all three structural constraints declared above. A block omitting
Axis 3 fails this gate.

---

**Exact-copy rule:** A downstream cite that describes or paraphrases is a paraphrase chain.
A downstream cite that reproduces the artifact label character-for-character is a reference
chain. Only reference chains satisfy the citation requirements.

**Structural prohibition:** Do not produce output in any phase that would require a downstream
phase to paraphrase rather than copy. Return to the phase and emit the required artifact.

**Required architecture label:**

> "CITATION ARCHITECTURE DECLARED. This architecture declares all artifact production
> requirements (rows 1--4), the Citation Chain Completeness Audit requirement (row 5), and
> the AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block with three co-resident axes (duality framing, audit
> column format, derivation direction). A block omitting Axis 3 fails its gate. All named
> artifacts must be produced exactly as declared. All downstream cites must copy upstream
> labels verbatim. AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor from the L3 Evidence column -- not
> from Phase 5(3) or CCV (Axis 3 prohibition). The audit must be produced after Phase 7 and
> must declare CHAIN COMPLETE before the CCV gate may proceed."

Do not proceed to Phase 1 until this label is written.

---

## Phase 1 -- Scoring Methodology Declaration

Before analyzing any persona, declare the inertia scoring framework.

**Dimension weights:**

| Dimension | Weight (High / Medium / Low) | Why this weight |
|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------|

Dimensions: Workaround satisfaction / Switching cost / Habit lock-in / Social proof requirement
/ Learning curve.

**Score thresholds:**

- **Critical:** [dimension combinations]
- **High:** [combinations]
- **Medium:** [combinations]
- **Low:** [condition all dimensions must satisfy]

**Required infrastructure label** (Citation Architecture row 1):

> "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED. All per-persona methodology traces in Phase 4 must cite
> this Phase 1 output by reference -- naming the specific dimension weights and tier thresholds
> declared above. Traces that reference dimension values without citing thresholds, or
> thresholds without dimension values, fail the per-score trace requirement."

Do not proceed to Phase 2 until written.

---

## Phase 2 -- Persona and Competitive Inventory

Identify 2--4 named personas. For each, treat the current solution as a named competitor.

- Name and role (specific)
- Current solution (named tool or method)
- Outcome the current solution delivers

**Competitive strength inventory per persona:**

| Dimension | Advantage | Durability |
|-----------|-----------|------------|

Durability must name a structural constraint. **Familiarity is not durability.** Structural
constraints: technical, organizational, integration-based, or switching-cost-based.

**Completeness gate:** For each persona: (1) all three fields present; (2) no Durability uses
familiarity/habit -- replace with structural constraint; (3) Dimension names a specific axis.
Do not proceed to Phase 3 until all personas pass all three checks.

**Required inventory label** (Citation Architecture row 2):

> "PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED. Phase 5(2) structural persistence analysis must cite this
> Phase 2 output by reference -- naming the specific Durability property by its Phase 2 label.
> A structural persistence claim that does not name the PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED artifact
> is a paraphrase chain, not a reference chain."

Do not proceed to Phase 3 until written.

---

## Phase 3 -- Inertia Dimension Analysis

| Persona | Workaround satisfaction (H/M/L) | Satisfaction basis (ref. Phase 2) | Switching cost (quantified) | Habit lock-in | Social proof threshold (named condition) | Learning curve |
|---------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|

Switching cost: time, steps, rating 1--10. Qualitative-only fails.
Social proof threshold: named count, role, or condition. Binary Y/N fails.

---

## Phase 4 -- Per-Persona Inertia Scores

| Persona | Score | Methodology trace |
|---------|-------|-------------------|

Methodology trace: (a) name dimension values from Phase 3 + (b) state Phase 1 threshold
satisfied. Cite Phase 1 by copying "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED" (Citation Architecture
row 1). Do not write "Phase 1." Write the artifact name. Every persona scored individually.

---

## Phase 5 -- Kill Barrier: Four-Part Causal Analysis with Reselection Gate

**KILL BARRIER** -- four labeled, distinct sub-parts. Do not merge any two.

**(1) Barrier definition** -- observable adoption friction; state the competitive dimension.
Do not include cause.

**(2) Structural persistence** -- why the barrier persists structurally. Cite PERSONA
INVENTORY DECLARED (Citation Architecture row 2): name the specific Durability property by
its Phase 2 label. A claim without naming the PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED artifact is a
paraphrase chain.

**(3) Intervention target** -- specific lever point. Name the target, not the intervention.

**Required lever label** (Citation Architecture row 3):

> **LEVER POINT: [exact label -- 3--7 words]**

**Falsifiability test:**

> "At T=6mo, the absence of this lever would be observable as: [specific observable
> behavioral or measurable condition]."

Replace Part (3) and repeat if you cannot produce a specific observable condition. Do not
write Part (4) until the test passes.

**(4) Lever efficacy** -- why addressing (3) resolves (2). Explain causally. Reference (2)
by name.

**Temporal persistence confirmation:**

| T=0 exists? | T=18mo persists without structural intervention? |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| YES / NO | YES / NO |

Both must be YES to qualify. If either is NO, return to the top of this phase.

**CONFIRMED KILL BARRIER.** Name the most exposed persona.

---

## Phase 6 -- Adoption Timeline and Kill-Barrier Trajectory Verdict

**Part A disqualifier (required before grid):**

> "This Part A grid captures per-persona trajectory only. It does not satisfy the
> kill-barrier trajectory verdict requirement. That output belongs exclusively to Part B."

| Persona | T=0 | T=6mo | T=18mo | Trajectory | Driver of change |
|---------|-----|-------|--------|------------|-----------------|

At least one trajectory non-flat. T=6mo and T=18mo cannot copy T=0 without a stated reason.

**Part B: KILL-BARRIER TRAJECTORY VERDICT**

**Trajectory direction:** [Resolving / Stable / Worsening]

**Structural reasoning:** [Reference the structural persistence property from Phase 5(2)
by name. Argue from mechanism, not from the per-persona grid.]

**Relationship to Part A:** [Alignment or divergence -- which structural property drives both,
or why they differ.]

**Required trajectory label** (Citation Architecture row 4):

> **TRAJECTORY VERDICT: [exact direction word -- Resolving, Stable, or Worsening]**

Do not proceed to Phase 7 until written.

---

## Phase 7 -- Overall Adoption Inertia Risk

Verdict: Low / Medium / High / Critical.

- Score distribution (e.g., "2 High, 1 Critical")
- Kill-barrier trajectory: copy the exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label (Citation Architecture
  row 4). Do not write "Phase 6 Part B." Write the exact label.
- Competitive summary: kill barrier dimension + Phase 2 structural durability basis
- 1--2 sentence rationale tying score distribution, trajectory, and confirmed kill barrier

---

## Citation Chain Completeness Audit

**(Citation Architecture row 5 -- required before CCV)**

Produce the 5-column audit table using the Axis 2 column structure from AUDIT ARCHITECTURE
DECLARED above. For each link, write the actual downstream cite text in the Evidence column.
Assign Link type and Verdict from that evidence.

| Link | Source artifact | Consumer site | Evidence (write actual downstream cite text) | Link type | Verdict |
|------|----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| L1 | [exact Phase 1 artifact name] | Phase 4 methodology traces | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 4 trace that names the Phase 1 artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L2 | [exact Phase 2 artifact name] | Phase 5(2) structural persistence | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 5(2) that names the Phase 2 artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L3 | [exact LEVER POINT label] | AMEND(d) lever anchor | [write the exact text that WILL appear in AMEND(d)'s "Lever anchor:" field -- this is a forward commitment per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED; AMEND(d) copies from this cell only; Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited sources per Axis 3] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L4 | [exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label] | Phase 7 trajectory cite | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 7 that names the Phase 6 Part B artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |

**Verdict rules:**
- Reference-chain: Evidence reproduces Source artifact label verbatim. Verdict: PASS.
- Description-chain: Evidence describes or paraphrases. Verdict: CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE --
  not "weaker," not "incomplete."
- L3 forward commitment: per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED, the text you write in
  the L3 Evidence cell is the source AMEND(d) copies from. Write the exact "Lever anchor:
  [LEVER POINT label]" text as it will appear. Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited.

**Required aggregate declaration on its own line:**

> "CHAIN COMPLETE: all four links are reference chains."

-- OR --

> "CHAIN BREAK: [list link IDs with CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] -- return to Phase [X] and
> produce the required named artifact before re-auditing."

**Gate rule:** Do not proceed to CCV until CHAIN COMPLETE is written. If CHAIN BREAK, correct
and re-audit.

---

## Citation Chain Verification

Before writing AMEND, complete all six fields with named text.

1. **Phase 1 artifact name:** [exact text produced in Phase 1]
2. **Phase 2 artifact name:** [exact text produced in Phase 2]
3. **Phase 4 citation:** [exact artifact name from (1) as it appears in Phase 4 traces]
4. **Phase 5(2) citation:** [exact artifact name from (2) as it appears in Phase 5(2)]
5. **Phase 5(3) lever label:** [exact LEVER POINT label]
6. **Phase 6 Part B trajectory label:** [exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label]

A field containing "Phase X" or "see above" without the actual artifact name fails.
Correct the upstream phase before proceeding.

---

## AMEND -- Focus, Quantify, Confirm

**Focus persona:** [name -- most exposed to confirmed kill barrier]

**Switching cost (sharpened):** [most precise quantified value]

**Kill barrier for this persona:** [one sentence -- competitive dimension, most acute because]

**Mitigation with full causal chain:**

> **(a) Intervention:** [one concrete action]
>
> **(b) Root cause addressed:** [name the structural condition from Phase 5(2)]
>
> **(c) Causal mechanism:** [why this lever reaches the structural condition in (2). Reference
> the Phase 5(3) lever point by name.]
>
> **(d) Confirmation signal at T=6mo:**
>
> Locate the L3 row of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit above. The Evidence column of

>
> "Lever anchor: [copy the exact text from the L3 Evidence cell of the Citation Chain

>

> behavioral or measurable condition]. Must be possible to observe it as absent.]

The lever anchor must reproduce the L3 Evidence cell text exactly. The AMEND section is not
complete without the lever anchor and the observable condition.

---

### V-63: Full Naming, No Partial-Failure Declaration (C-40 PARTIAL -- no impossibility statement)

**Axis:** AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block gate condition names all three axes by "Axis N"
label but contains no statement that a block with fewer than all three axes fails the gate.
The gate is a completeness checklist without an impossibility declaration.
**Hypothesis:** C-40 earns PARTIAL (5 pts). All three axes named (condition 1 met) but no
partial-failure declared (condition 2 absent). The rubric's two explicit PARTIAL conditions
do not cover this combination -- expected PARTIAL as a genuine attempt; could be FAIL on a
strict reading since both conditions are required for PASS. C-38 and C-39 unchanged (PASS).
Total predicted: 395/400.
**Change from V-60:** Gate condition retains the three-bullet "Axis N" enumeration but drops
the final impossibility statement ("A block containing Axes 1 and 2 but omitting Axis 3 fails
this gate"). Required architecture label updated to omit the partial-failure clause.

## Citation Architecture

Read this section once, in full, before Phase 1 begins. This architecture declares every
named artifact, exact-copy requirement, and derivation direction constraint before any
production phase begins. The three structural axes governing citation chain integrity are
declared in the AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block below. Read the block before Phase 1.

**Named artifacts, required outputs, and verification:**

| # | Phase / Position | Artifact or output | Downstream consumer | Requirement |
|---|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Phase 1 | "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED" | Phase 4 methodology traces | Exact-copy: copy artifact name, not "Phase 1" |
| 2 | Phase 2 | "PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED" | Phase 5(2) structural persistence | Exact-copy: copy artifact name, not "Phase 2" |
| 3 | Phase 5(3) | "LEVER POINT: [label]" | CCV (5); AMEND(d) | Exact-copy: copy the exact label string verbatim. AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor FROM the L3 Evidence column of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit -- the audit is the derivation authority; do not construct from Phase 5(3) and retroactively confirm. |
| 4 | Phase 6 Part B | "TRAJECTORY VERDICT: [direction]" | Phase 7; CCV (6) | Exact-copy: copy the exact direction word |
| 5 | After Phase 7, before CCV | CITATION CHAIN COMPLETENESS AUDIT | Self-verifying | See AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block below (Axes 1--3); CHAIN COMPLETE gate before CCV |

---

**AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED**

This block declares three co-resident constraints. A model reading this block before Phase 1
knows all three architecture constraints before executing any phase. All three axes are
required content of this block. A block missing any axis is an incomplete architecture
declaration.

**Axis 1 -- Duality framing:** This output has two structural artifacts serving distinct and
non-substitutable roles. The Citation Architecture preamble (rows 1--5 above) is declarative:
it specifies what will be produced and how it will be cited before any production phase
begins. The Citation Chain Completeness Audit is confirmatory: it verifies what was produced
after all production phases are complete. These roles are structurally distinct. The preamble
cannot confirm chain integrity because it precedes production. The audit cannot declare
artifact names and exact-copy requirements because those must be known before Phase 1.
Neither artifact substitutes for or subsumes the other's function.

**Axis 2 -- Audit format:** The Citation Chain Completeness Audit (row 5) must use the
following 5-column structure for all four links: Source artifact | Consumer site | Evidence
[write actual downstream cite text verbatim -- for L3, write the exact "Lever anchor:
[LEVER POINT label]" text that will appear in AMEND(d); for L1/L2/L4, write the phrase from
the consuming section that names the source artifact character-for-character; write the actual
text produced, not a description or summary; the Evidence cell must be populated with real
text, not a placeholder] | Link type [Reference-chain if Evidence reproduces source artifact
label verbatim; Description-chain if Evidence describes or paraphrases] | Verdict [PASS for
Reference-chain; CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE for Description-chain -- not "weaker" or
"incomplete"]. Close with "CHAIN COMPLETE: all four links are reference chains" or "CHAIN
BREAK: [list link IDs] -- return to Phase [X] before proceeding."

**Axis 3 -- Derivation direction:** AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor from the L3
Evidence column of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit. Phase 5(3) is a prohibited
derivation source for the lever anchor in AMEND(d). CCV is a prohibited derivation source
for the lever anchor in AMEND(d). The L3 Evidence cell is the one permitted source. AMEND(d)
does not construct the anchor independently and retroactively confirm; it copies from L3
Evidence directly. This derivation direction and these prohibitions are declared at the
architecture-read boundary so that the full constraint -- required source AND forbidden
sources -- is known before any production phase begins.

Do not proceed to Phase 1 until all of the following are confirmed above:
- "AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED" is written on its own line.
- Axis 1 (duality framing: declarative vs. confirmatory structural roles) is present.
- Axis 2 (5-column audit format with Evidence-column semantics) is present.
- Axis 3 (derivation direction with Phase 5(3) and CCV named as prohibited sources) is present.

---

**Exact-copy rule:** A downstream cite that describes or paraphrases is a paraphrase chain.
A downstream cite that reproduces the artifact label character-for-character is a reference
chain. Only reference chains satisfy the citation requirements.

**Structural prohibition:** Do not produce output in any phase that would require a downstream
phase to paraphrase rather than copy. Return to the phase and emit the required artifact.

**Required architecture label:**

> "CITATION ARCHITECTURE DECLARED. This architecture declares all artifact production
> requirements (rows 1--4), the Citation Chain Completeness Audit requirement (row 5), and
> the AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block with three co-resident axes: Axis 1 duality framing,
> Axis 2 audit column format with Evidence semantics, Axis 3 derivation direction with Phase
> 5(3) and CCV named as prohibited sources. All three axes must be present before Phase 1.
> All named artifacts must be produced exactly as declared. All downstream cites must copy
> upstream labels verbatim. AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor from the L3 Evidence column
> -- not from Phase 5(3) or CCV (Axis 3 prohibition). The audit must be produced after Phase
> 7 and must declare CHAIN COMPLETE before the CCV gate may proceed."

Do not proceed to Phase 1 until this label is written.

---

## Phase 1 -- Scoring Methodology Declaration

Before analyzing any persona, declare the inertia scoring framework.

**Dimension weights:**

| Dimension | Weight (High / Medium / Low) | Why this weight |
|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------|

Dimensions: Workaround satisfaction / Switching cost / Habit lock-in / Social proof requirement
/ Learning curve.

**Score thresholds:**

- **Critical:** [dimension combinations]
- **High:** [combinations]
- **Medium:** [combinations]
- **Low:** [condition all dimensions must satisfy]

**Required infrastructure label** (Citation Architecture row 1):

> "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED. All per-persona methodology traces in Phase 4 must cite
> this Phase 1 output by reference -- naming the specific dimension weights and tier thresholds
> declared above. Traces that reference dimension values without citing thresholds, or
> thresholds without dimension values, fail the per-score trace requirement."

Do not proceed to Phase 2 until written.

---

## Phase 2 -- Persona and Competitive Inventory

Identify 2--4 named personas. For each, treat the current solution as a named competitor.

- Name and role (specific)
- Current solution (named tool or method)
- Outcome the current solution delivers

**Competitive strength inventory per persona:**

| Dimension | Advantage | Durability |
|-----------|-----------|------------|

Durability must name a structural constraint. **Familiarity is not durability.** Structural
constraints: technical, organizational, integration-based, or switching-cost-based.

**Completeness gate:** For each persona: (1) all three fields present; (2) no Durability uses
familiarity/habit -- replace with structural constraint; (3) Dimension names a specific axis.
Do not proceed to Phase 3 until all personas pass all three checks.

**Required inventory label** (Citation Architecture row 2):

> "PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED. Phase 5(2) structural persistence analysis must cite this
> Phase 2 output by reference -- naming the specific Durability property by its Phase 2 label.
> A structural persistence claim that does not name the PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED artifact
> is a paraphrase chain, not a reference chain."

Do not proceed to Phase 3 until written.

---

## Phase 3 -- Inertia Dimension Analysis

| Persona | Workaround satisfaction (H/M/L) | Satisfaction basis (ref. Phase 2) | Switching cost (quantified) | Habit lock-in | Social proof threshold (named condition) | Learning curve |
|---------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|

Switching cost: time, steps, rating 1--10. Qualitative-only fails.
Social proof threshold: named count, role, or condition. Binary Y/N fails.

---

## Phase 4 -- Per-Persona Inertia Scores

| Persona | Score | Methodology trace |
|---------|-------|-------------------|

Methodology trace: (a) name dimension values from Phase 3 + (b) state Phase 1 threshold
satisfied. Cite Phase 1 by copying "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED" (Citation Architecture
row 1). Do not write "Phase 1." Write the artifact name. Every persona scored individually.

---

## Phase 5 -- Kill Barrier: Four-Part Causal Analysis with Reselection Gate

**KILL BARRIER** -- four labeled, distinct sub-parts. Do not merge any two.

**(1) Barrier definition** -- observable adoption friction; state the competitive dimension.
Do not include cause.

**(2) Structural persistence** -- why the barrier persists structurally. Cite PERSONA
INVENTORY DECLARED (Citation Architecture row 2): name the specific Durability property by
its Phase 2 label. A claim without naming the PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED artifact is a
paraphrase chain.

**(3) Intervention target** -- specific lever point. Name the target, not the intervention.

**Required lever label** (Citation Architecture row 3):

> **LEVER POINT: [exact label -- 3--7 words]**

**Falsifiability test:**

> "At T=6mo, the absence of this lever would be observable as: [specific observable
> behavioral or measurable condition]."

Replace Part (3) and repeat if you cannot produce a specific observable condition. Do not
write Part (4) until the test passes.

**(4) Lever efficacy** -- why addressing (3) resolves (2). Explain causally. Reference (2)
by name.

**Temporal persistence confirmation:**

| T=0 exists? | T=18mo persists without structural intervention? |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| YES / NO | YES / NO |

Both must be YES to qualify. If either is NO, return to the top of this phase.

**CONFIRMED KILL BARRIER.** Name the most exposed persona.

---

## Phase 6 -- Adoption Timeline and Kill-Barrier Trajectory Verdict

**Part A disqualifier (required before grid):**

> "This Part A grid captures per-persona trajectory only. It does not satisfy the
> kill-barrier trajectory verdict requirement. That output belongs exclusively to Part B."

| Persona | T=0 | T=6mo | T=18mo | Trajectory | Driver of change |
|---------|-----|-------|--------|------------|-----------------|

At least one trajectory non-flat. T=6mo and T=18mo cannot copy T=0 without a stated reason.

**Part B: KILL-BARRIER TRAJECTORY VERDICT**

**Trajectory direction:** [Resolving / Stable / Worsening]

**Structural reasoning:** [Reference the structural persistence property from Phase 5(2)
by name. Argue from mechanism, not from the per-persona grid.]

**Relationship to Part A:** [Alignment or divergence -- which structural property drives both,
or why they differ.]

**Required trajectory label** (Citation Architecture row 4):

> **TRAJECTORY VERDICT: [exact direction word -- Resolving, Stable, or Worsening]**

Do not proceed to Phase 7 until written.

---

## Phase 7 -- Overall Adoption Inertia Risk

Verdict: Low / Medium / High / Critical.

- Score distribution (e.g., "2 High, 1 Critical")
- Kill-barrier trajectory: copy the exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label (Citation Architecture
  row 4). Do not write "Phase 6 Part B." Write the exact label.
- Competitive summary: kill barrier dimension + Phase 2 structural durability basis
- 1--2 sentence rationale tying score distribution, trajectory, and confirmed kill barrier

---

## Citation Chain Completeness Audit

**(Citation Architecture row 5 -- required before CCV)**

Produce the 5-column audit table using the Axis 2 column structure from AUDIT ARCHITECTURE
DECLARED above. For each link, write the actual downstream cite text in the Evidence column.
Assign Link type and Verdict from that evidence.

| Link | Source artifact | Consumer site | Evidence (write actual downstream cite text) | Link type | Verdict |
|------|----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| L1 | [exact Phase 1 artifact name] | Phase 4 methodology traces | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 4 trace that names the Phase 1 artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L2 | [exact Phase 2 artifact name] | Phase 5(2) structural persistence | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 5(2) that names the Phase 2 artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L3 | [exact LEVER POINT label] | AMEND(d) lever anchor | [write the exact text that WILL appear in AMEND(d)'s "Lever anchor:" field -- this is a forward commitment per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED; AMEND(d) copies from this cell only; Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited sources per Axis 3] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L4 | [exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label] | Phase 7 trajectory cite | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 7 that names the Phase 6 Part B artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |

**Verdict rules:**
- Reference-chain: Evidence reproduces Source artifact label verbatim. Verdict: PASS.
- Description-chain: Evidence describes or paraphrases. Verdict: CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE --
  not "weaker," not "incomplete."
- L3 forward commitment: per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED, the text you write in
  the L3 Evidence cell is the source AMEND(d) copies from. Write the exact "Lever anchor:
  [LEVER POINT label]" text as it will appear. Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited.

**Required aggregate declaration on its own line:**

> "CHAIN COMPLETE: all four links are reference chains."

-- OR --

> "CHAIN BREAK: [list link IDs with CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] -- return to Phase [X] and
> produce the required named artifact before re-auditing."

**Gate rule:** Do not proceed to CCV until CHAIN COMPLETE is written. If CHAIN BREAK, correct
and re-audit.

---

## Citation Chain Verification

Before writing AMEND, complete all six fields with named text.

1. **Phase 1 artifact name:** [exact text produced in Phase 1]
2. **Phase 2 artifact name:** [exact text produced in Phase 2]
3. **Phase 4 citation:** [exact artifact name from (1) as it appears in Phase 4 traces]
4. **Phase 5(2) citation:** [exact artifact name from (2) as it appears in Phase 5(2)]
5. **Phase 5(3) lever label:** [exact LEVER POINT label]
6. **Phase 6 Part B trajectory label:** [exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label]

A field containing "Phase X" or "see above" without the actual artifact name fails.
Correct the upstream phase before proceeding.

---

## AMEND -- Focus, Quantify, Confirm

**Focus persona:** [name -- most exposed to confirmed kill barrier]

**Switching cost (sharpened):** [most precise quantified value]

**Kill barrier for this persona:** [one sentence -- competitive dimension, most acute because]

**Mitigation with full causal chain:**

> **(a) Intervention:** [one concrete action]
>
> **(b) Root cause addressed:** [name the structural condition from Phase 5(2)]
>
> **(c) Causal mechanism:** [why this lever reaches the structural condition in (2). Reference
> the Phase 5(3) lever point by name.]
>
> **(d) Confirmation signal at T=6mo:**
>
> Locate the L3 row of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit above. The Evidence column of

> behavioral or measurable condition]. Must be possible to observe it as absent.]

The lever anchor must reproduce the L3 Evidence cell text exactly. The AMEND section is not
complete without the lever anchor and the observable condition.

---

### V-64: Ceiling (V-60 Exact Form -- C-40 Baseline Confirmation)

**Axis:** Verbatim reproduction of V-60. All three axes named by "Axis N" label in the gate
condition. Explicit partial-failure declaration: "A block containing Axes 1 and 2 but omitting
Axis 3 fails this gate." This is the recommended production variant from R12 and the predicted
ceiling variation for R13.
**Hypothesis:** C-40 earns PASS (10 pts). Both pass conditions met: all three axes named by
label AND partial satisfaction declared a gate failure. C-38 and C-39 unchanged (PASS).
Total predicted: 400/400. Ceiling.
**Change from V-60:** None. Verbatim reproduction to confirm C-40 scoring under rubric v13.

## Citation Architecture

Read this section once, in full, before Phase 1 begins. This architecture declares every
named artifact, exact-copy requirement, and derivation direction constraint before any
production phase begins. The three structural axes governing citation chain integrity are
declared in the AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block below. Read the block before Phase 1.

**Named artifacts, required outputs, and verification:**

| # | Phase / Position | Artifact or output | Downstream consumer | Requirement |
|---|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Phase 1 | "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED" | Phase 4 methodology traces | Exact-copy: copy artifact name, not "Phase 1" |
| 2 | Phase 2 | "PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED" | Phase 5(2) structural persistence | Exact-copy: copy artifact name, not "Phase 2" |
| 3 | Phase 5(3) | "LEVER POINT: [label]" | CCV (5); AMEND(d) | Exact-copy: copy the exact label string verbatim. AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor FROM the L3 Evidence column of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit -- the audit is the derivation authority; do not construct from Phase 5(3) and retroactively confirm. |
| 4 | Phase 6 Part B | "TRAJECTORY VERDICT: [direction]" | Phase 7; CCV (6) | Exact-copy: copy the exact direction word |
| 5 | After Phase 7, before CCV | CITATION CHAIN COMPLETENESS AUDIT | Self-verifying | See AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block below (Axes 1--3); CHAIN COMPLETE gate before CCV |

---

**AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED**

This block declares three co-resident constraints. A model reading this block before Phase 1
knows all three architecture constraints before executing any phase. All three axes are
required content of this block. A block missing any axis is an incomplete architecture
declaration.

**Axis 1 -- Duality framing:** This output has two structural artifacts serving distinct and
non-substitutable roles. The Citation Architecture preamble (rows 1--5 above) is declarative:
it specifies what will be produced and how it will be cited before any production phase
begins. The Citation Chain Completeness Audit is confirmatory: it verifies what was produced
after all production phases are complete. These roles are structurally distinct. The preamble
cannot confirm chain integrity because it precedes production. The audit cannot declare
artifact names and exact-copy requirements because those must be known before Phase 1.
Neither artifact substitutes for or subsumes the other's function.

**Axis 2 -- Audit format:** The Citation Chain Completeness Audit (row 5) must use the
following 5-column structure for all four links: Source artifact | Consumer site | Evidence
[write actual downstream cite text verbatim -- for L3, write the exact "Lever anchor:
[LEVER POINT label]" text that will appear in AMEND(d); for L1/L2/L4, write the phrase from
the consuming section that names the source artifact character-for-character; write the actual
text produced, not a description or summary; the Evidence cell must be populated with real
text, not a placeholder] | Link type [Reference-chain if Evidence reproduces source artifact
label verbatim; Description-chain if Evidence describes or paraphrases] | Verdict [PASS for
Reference-chain; CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE for Description-chain -- not "weaker" or
"incomplete"]. Close with "CHAIN COMPLETE: all four links are reference chains" or "CHAIN
BREAK: [list link IDs] -- return to Phase [X] before proceeding."

**Axis 3 -- Derivation direction:** AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor from the L3
Evidence column of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit. Phase 5(3) is a prohibited
derivation source for the lever anchor in AMEND(d). CCV is a prohibited derivation source
for the lever anchor in AMEND(d). The L3 Evidence cell is the one permitted source. AMEND(d)
does not construct the anchor independently and retroactively confirm; it copies from L3
Evidence directly. This derivation direction and these prohibitions are declared at the
architecture-read boundary so that the full constraint -- required source AND forbidden
sources -- is known before any production phase begins.

Do not proceed to Phase 1 until all of the following are confirmed above:
- "AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED" is written on its own line.
- Axis 1 (duality framing: declarative vs. confirmatory structural roles) is present.
- Axis 2 (5-column audit format with Evidence-column semantics) is present.
- Axis 3 (derivation direction with Phase 5(3) and CCV named as prohibited sources) is present.
A block containing Axes 1 and 2 but omitting Axis 3 fails this gate.

---

**Exact-copy rule:** A downstream cite that describes or paraphrases is a paraphrase chain.
A downstream cite that reproduces the artifact label character-for-character is a reference
chain. Only reference chains satisfy the citation requirements.

**Structural prohibition:** Do not produce output in any phase that would require a downstream
phase to paraphrase rather than copy. Return to the phase and emit the required artifact.

**Required architecture label:**

> "CITATION ARCHITECTURE DECLARED. This architecture declares all artifact production
> requirements (rows 1--4), the Citation Chain Completeness Audit requirement (row 5), and
> the AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block with three co-resident axes: Axis 1 duality framing,
> Axis 2 audit column format with Evidence semantics, Axis 3 derivation direction with Phase
> 5(3) and CCV named as prohibited sources. All named artifacts must be produced exactly as
> declared. All downstream cites must copy upstream labels verbatim. AMEND(d) must derive its
> lever anchor from the L3 Evidence column -- not from Phase 5(3) or CCV (Axis 3 prohibition).
> The audit must be produced after Phase 7 and must declare CHAIN COMPLETE before the CCV
> gate may proceed."

Do not proceed to Phase 1 until this label is written.

---

## Phase 1 -- Scoring Methodology Declaration

Before analyzing any persona, declare the inertia scoring framework.

**Dimension weights:**

| Dimension | Weight (High / Medium / Low) | Why this weight |
|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------|

Dimensions: Workaround satisfaction / Switching cost / Habit lock-in / Social proof requirement
/ Learning curve.

**Score thresholds:**

- **Critical:** [dimension combinations]
- **High:** [combinations]
- **Medium:** [combinations]
- **Low:** [condition all dimensions must satisfy]

**Required infrastructure label** (Citation Architecture row 1):

> "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED. All per-persona methodology traces in Phase 4 must cite
> this Phase 1 output by reference -- naming the specific dimension weights and tier thresholds
> declared above. Traces that reference dimension values without citing thresholds, or
> thresholds without dimension values, fail the per-score trace requirement."

Do not proceed to Phase 2 until written.

---

## Phase 2 -- Persona and Competitive Inventory

Identify 2--4 named personas. For each, treat the current solution as a named competitor.

- Name and role (specific)
- Current solution (named tool or method)
- Outcome the current solution delivers

**Competitive strength inventory per persona:**

| Dimension | Advantage | Durability |
|-----------|-----------|------------|

Durability must name a structural constraint. **Familiarity is not durability.** Structural
constraints: technical, organizational, integration-based, or switching-cost-based.

**Completeness gate:** For each persona: (1) all three fields present; (2) no Durability uses
familiarity/habit -- replace with structural constraint; (3) Dimension names a specific axis.
Do not proceed to Phase 3 until all personas pass all three checks.

**Required inventory label** (Citation Architecture row 2):

> "PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED. Phase 5(2) structural persistence analysis must cite this
> Phase 2 output by reference -- naming the specific Durability property by its Phase 2 label.
> A structural persistence claim that does not name the PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED artifact
> is a paraphrase chain, not a reference chain."

Do not proceed to Phase 3 until written.

---

## Phase 3 -- Inertia Dimension Analysis

| Persona | Workaround satisfaction (H/M/L) | Satisfaction basis (ref. Phase 2) | Switching cost (quantified) | Habit lock-in | Social proof threshold (named condition) | Learning curve |
|---------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|

Switching cost: time, steps, rating 1--10. Qualitative-only fails.
Social proof threshold: named count, role, or condition. Binary Y/N fails.

---

## Phase 4 -- Per-Persona Inertia Scores

| Persona | Score | Methodology trace |
|---------|-------|-------------------|

Methodology trace: (a) name dimension values from Phase 3 + (b) state Phase 1 threshold
satisfied. Cite Phase 1 by copying "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED" (Citation Architecture
row 1). Do not write "Phase 1." Write the artifact name. Every persona scored individually.

---

## Phase 5 -- Kill Barrier: Four-Part Causal Analysis with Reselection Gate

**KILL BARRIER** -- four labeled, distinct sub-parts. Do not merge any two.

**(1) Barrier definition** -- observable adoption friction; state the competitive dimension.
Do not include cause.

**(2) Structural persistence** -- why the barrier persists structurally. Cite PERSONA
INVENTORY DECLARED (Citation Architecture row 2): name the specific Durability property by
its Phase 2 label. A claim without naming the PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED artifact is a
paraphrase chain.

**(3) Intervention target** -- specific lever point. Name the target, not the intervention.

**Required lever label** (Citation Architecture row 3):

> **LEVER POINT: [exact label -- 3--7 words]**

**Falsifiability test:**

> "At T=6mo, the absence of this lever would be observable as: [specific observable
> behavioral or measurable condition]."

Replace Part (3) and repeat if you cannot produce a specific observable condition. Do not
write Part (4) until the test passes.

**(4) Lever efficacy** -- why addressing (3) resolves (2). Explain causally. Reference (2)
by name.

**Temporal persistence confirmation:**

| T=0 exists? | T=18mo persists without structural intervention? |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| YES / NO | YES / NO |

Both must be YES to qualify. If either is NO, return to the top of this phase.

**CONFIRMED KILL BARRIER.** Name the most exposed persona.

---

## Phase 6 -- Adoption Timeline and Kill-Barrier Trajectory Verdict

**Part A disqualifier (required before grid):**

> "This Part A grid captures per-persona trajectory only. It does not satisfy the
> kill-barrier trajectory verdict requirement. That output belongs exclusively to Part B."

| Persona | T=0 | T=6mo | T=18mo | Trajectory | Driver of change |
|---------|-----|-------|--------|------------|-----------------|

At least one trajectory non-flat. T=6mo and T=18mo cannot copy T=0 without a stated reason.

**Part B: KILL-BARRIER TRAJECTORY VERDICT**

**Trajectory direction:** [Resolving / Stable / Worsening]

**Structural reasoning:** [Reference the structural persistence property from Phase 5(2)
by name. Argue from mechanism, not from the per-persona grid.]

**Relationship to Part A:** [Alignment or divergence -- which structural property drives both,
or why they differ.]

**Required trajectory label** (Citation Architecture row 4):

> **TRAJECTORY VERDICT: [exact direction word -- Resolving, Stable, or Worsening]**

Do not proceed to Phase 7 until written.

---

## Phase 7 -- Overall Adoption Inertia Risk

Verdict: Low / Medium / High / Critical.

- Score distribution (e.g., "2 High, 1 Critical")
- Kill-barrier trajectory: copy the exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label (Citation Architecture
  row 4). Do not write "Phase 6 Part B." Write the exact label.
- Competitive summary: kill barrier dimension + Phase 2 structural durability basis
- 1--2 sentence rationale tying score distribution, trajectory, and confirmed kill barrier

---

## Citation Chain Completeness Audit

**(Citation Architecture row 5 -- required before CCV)**

Produce the 5-column audit table using the Axis 2 column structure from AUDIT ARCHITECTURE
DECLARED above. For each link, write the actual downstream cite text in the Evidence column.
Assign Link type and Verdict from that evidence.

| Link | Source artifact | Consumer site | Evidence (write actual downstream cite text) | Link type | Verdict |
|------|----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| L1 | [exact Phase 1 artifact name] | Phase 4 methodology traces | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 4 trace that names the Phase 1 artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L2 | [exact Phase 2 artifact name] | Phase 5(2) structural persistence | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 5(2) that names the Phase 2 artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L3 | [exact LEVER POINT label] | AMEND(d) lever anchor | [write the exact text that WILL appear in AMEND(d)'s "Lever anchor:" field -- this is a forward commitment per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED; AMEND(d) copies from this cell only; Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited sources per Axis 3] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L4 | [exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label] | Phase 7 trajectory cite | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 7 that names the Phase 6 Part B artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |

**Verdict rules:**
- Reference-chain: Evidence reproduces Source artifact label verbatim. Verdict: PASS.
- Description-chain: Evidence describes or paraphrases. Verdict: CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE --
  not "weaker," not "incomplete."
- L3 forward commitment: per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED, the text you write in
  the L3 Evidence cell is the source AMEND(d) copies from. Write the exact "Lever anchor:
  [LEVER POINT label]" text as it will appear. Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited.

**Required aggregate declaration on its own line:**

> "CHAIN COMPLETE: all four links are reference chains."

-- OR --

> "CHAIN BREAK: [list link IDs with CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] -- return to Phase [X] and
> produce the required named artifact before re-auditing."

**Gate rule:** Do not proceed to CCV until CHAIN COMPLETE is written. If CHAIN BREAK, correct
and re-audit.

---

## Citation Chain Verification

Before writing AMEND, complete all six fields with named text.

1. **Phase 1 artifact name:** [exact text produced in Phase 1]
2. **Phase 2 artifact name:** [exact text produced in Phase 2]
3. **Phase 4 citation:** [exact artifact name from (1) as it appears in Phase 4 traces]
4. **Phase 5(2) citation:** [exact artifact name from (2) as it appears in Phase 5(2)]
5. **Phase 5(3) lever label:** [exact LEVER POINT label]
6. **Phase 6 Part B trajectory label:** [exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label]

A field containing "Phase X" or "see above" without the actual artifact name fails.
Correct the upstream phase before proceeding.

---

## AMEND -- Focus, Quantify, Confirm

**Focus persona:** [name -- most exposed to confirmed kill barrier]

**Switching cost (sharpened):** [most precise quantified value]

**Kill barrier for this persona:** [one sentence -- competitive dimension, most acute because]

**Mitigation with full causal chain:**

> **(a) Intervention:** [one concrete action]
>
> **(b) Root cause addressed:** [name the structural condition from Phase 5(2)]
>
> **(c) Causal mechanism:** [why this lever reaches the structural condition in (2). Reference
> the Phase 5(3) lever point by name.]
>
> **(d) Confirmation signal at T=6mo:**
>
> Locate the L3 row of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit above. The Evidence column of
> that row contains the lever anchor text you pre-committed to when you wrote the audit. That
> cell is the derivation authority per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED. Copy its
> contents exactly, character-for-character, into the "Lever anchor:" field below. Do not
> reconstruct the anchor from Phase 5(3). Do not use CCV step (5) as the source. Both are

>
> "Lever anchor: [copy the exact text from the L3 Evidence cell of the Citation Chain
> Completeness Audit -- Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE
> DECLARED; do not reconstruct]."
>
> [At T=6mo, the absence of this lever would be observable as: [specific falsifiable
> behavioral or measurable condition]. Must be possible to observe it as absent.]

The lever anchor must reproduce the L3 Evidence cell text exactly. The AMEND section is not
complete without the lever anchor and the observable condition.

---

### V-65: Gate in Label Only (C-40 Placement Axis)

**Axis:** The AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block gate instruction is minimal -- it requires the
block output line to be written but does NOT enumerate axes by name or declare partial failure.
The per-axis enumeration and partial-failure declaration live exclusively in the required
architecture label. Tests whether C-40's "block to include an explicit gate condition" means
the gate instruction within the block body, or whether a gate in the produced architecture
label satisfies the criterion.
**Hypothesis:** C-40 earns FAIL (0 pts) or PARTIAL (5 pts). The architecture label is an
artifact the model emits, not a gate that enforces block completeness before Phase 1. The
criterion says the block must include the gate; a gate in the label outside the block
instruction does not satisfy "the block to include an explicit gate condition." C-38 and C-39
unchanged (PASS). Total predicted: 390/400 or 395/400.
**Change from V-60:** Block gate instruction drops the per-axis bullet enumeration and the
impossibility statement, retaining only "AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED on its own line." The
required architecture label gains the full three-axis enumeration and partial-failure clause
that V-60 carries in the gate instruction.

## Citation Architecture

Read this section once, in full, before Phase 1 begins. This architecture declares every
named artifact, exact-copy requirement, and derivation direction constraint before any
production phase begins. The three structural axes governing citation chain integrity are
declared in the AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block below. Read the block before Phase 1.

**Named artifacts, required outputs, and verification:**

| # | Phase / Position | Artifact or output | Downstream consumer | Requirement |
|---|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Phase 1 | "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED" | Phase 4 methodology traces | Exact-copy: copy artifact name, not "Phase 1" |
| 2 | Phase 2 | "PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED" | Phase 5(2) structural persistence | Exact-copy: copy artifact name, not "Phase 2" |
| 3 | Phase 5(3) | "LEVER POINT: [label]" | CCV (5); AMEND(d) | Exact-copy: copy the exact label string verbatim. AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor FROM the L3 Evidence column of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit -- the audit is the derivation authority; do not construct from Phase 5(3) and retroactively confirm. |
| 4 | Phase 6 Part B | "TRAJECTORY VERDICT: [direction]" | Phase 7; CCV (6) | Exact-copy: copy the exact direction word |
| 5 | After Phase 7, before CCV | CITATION CHAIN COMPLETENESS AUDIT | Self-verifying | See AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block below (Axes 1--3); CHAIN COMPLETE gate before CCV |

---

**AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED**

This block declares three co-resident constraints. A model reading this block before Phase 1
knows all three architecture constraints before executing any phase. All three axes are
required content of this block. A block missing any axis is an incomplete architecture
declaration.

**Axis 1 -- Duality framing:** This output has two structural artifacts serving distinct and
non-substitutable roles. The Citation Architecture preamble (rows 1--5 above) is declarative:
it specifies what will be produced and how it will be cited before any production phase
begins. The Citation Chain Completeness Audit is confirmatory: it verifies what was produced
after all production phases are complete. These roles are structurally distinct. The preamble
cannot confirm chain integrity because it precedes production. The audit cannot declare
artifact names and exact-copy requirements because those must be known before Phase 1.
Neither artifact substitutes for or subsumes the other's function.

**Axis 2 -- Audit format:** The Citation Chain Completeness Audit (row 5) must use the
following 5-column structure for all four links: Source artifact | Consumer site | Evidence
[write actual downstream cite text verbatim -- for L3, write the exact "Lever anchor:
[LEVER POINT label]" text that will appear in AMEND(d); for L1/L2/L4, write the phrase from
the consuming section that names the source artifact character-for-character; write the actual
text produced, not a description or summary; the Evidence cell must be populated with real
text, not a placeholder] | Link type [Reference-chain if Evidence reproduces source artifact
label verbatim; Description-chain if Evidence describes or paraphrases] | Verdict [PASS for
Reference-chain; CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE for Description-chain -- not "weaker" or
"incomplete"]. Close with "CHAIN COMPLETE: all four links are reference chains" or "CHAIN
BREAK: [list link IDs] -- return to Phase [X] before proceeding."

**Axis 3 -- Derivation direction:** AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor from the L3
Evidence column of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit. Phase 5(3) is a prohibited
derivation source for the lever anchor in AMEND(d). CCV is a prohibited derivation source
for the lever anchor in AMEND(d). The L3 Evidence cell is the one permitted source. AMEND(d)
does not construct the anchor independently and retroactively confirm; it copies from L3
Evidence directly. This derivation direction and these prohibitions are declared at the
architecture-read boundary so that the full constraint -- required source AND forbidden
sources -- is known before any production phase begins.

Do not proceed to Phase 1 until "AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED" is written on its own line
above.

---

**Exact-copy rule:** A downstream cite that describes or paraphrases is a paraphrase chain.
A downstream cite that reproduces the artifact label character-for-character is a reference
chain. Only reference chains satisfy the citation requirements.

**Structural prohibition:** Do not produce output in any phase that would require a downstream
phase to paraphrase rather than copy. Return to the phase and emit the required artifact.

**Required architecture label:**

> "CITATION ARCHITECTURE DECLARED. This architecture declares all artifact production
> requirements (rows 1--4), the Citation Chain Completeness Audit requirement (row 5), and
> the AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block with three required axes: Axis 1 (duality framing:
> declarative vs. confirmatory structural roles), Axis 2 (5-column audit format with
> Evidence-column semantics), Axis 3 (derivation direction with Phase 5(3) and CCV named as
> prohibited sources). A block containing Axes 1 and 2 but omitting Axis 3 fails this gate.
> All named artifacts must be produced exactly as declared. All downstream cites must copy
> upstream labels verbatim. AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor from the L3 Evidence column
> -- not from Phase 5(3) or CCV (Axis 3 prohibition). The audit must be produced after Phase
> 7 and must declare CHAIN COMPLETE before the CCV gate may proceed."

Do not proceed to Phase 1 until this label is written.

---

## Phase 1 -- Scoring Methodology Declaration

Before analyzing any persona, declare the inertia scoring framework.

**Dimension weights:**

| Dimension | Weight (High / Medium / Low) | Why this weight |
|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------|

Dimensions: Workaround satisfaction / Switching cost / Habit lock-in / Social proof requirement
/ Learning curve.

**Score thresholds:**

- **Critical:** [dimension combinations]
- **High:** [combinations]
- **Medium:** [combinations]
- **Low:** [condition all dimensions must satisfy]

**Required infrastructure label** (Citation Architecture row 1):

> "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED. All per-persona methodology traces in Phase 4 must cite
> this Phase 1 output by reference -- naming the specific dimension weights and tier thresholds
> declared above. Traces that reference dimension values without citing thresholds, or
> thresholds without dimension values, fail the per-score trace requirement."

Do not proceed to Phase 2 until written.

---

## Phase 2 -- Persona and Competitive Inventory

Identify 2--4 named personas. For each, treat the current solution as a named competitor.

- Name and role (specific)
- Current solution (named tool or method)
- Outcome the current solution delivers

**Competitive strength inventory per persona:**

| Dimension | Advantage | Durability |
|-----------|-----------|------------|

Durability must name a structural constraint. **Familiarity is not durability.** Structural
constraints: technical, organizational, integration-based, or switching-cost-based.

**Completeness gate:** For each persona: (1) all three fields present; (2) no Durability uses
familiarity/habit -- replace with structural constraint; (3) Dimension names a specific axis.
Do not proceed to Phase 3 until all personas pass all three checks.

**Required inventory label** (Citation Architecture row 2):

> "PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED. Phase 5(2) structural persistence analysis must cite this
> Phase 2 output by reference -- naming the specific Durability property by its Phase 2 label.
> A structural persistence claim that does not name the PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED artifact
> is a paraphrase chain, not a reference chain."

Do not proceed to Phase 3 until written.

---

## Phase 3 -- Inertia Dimension Analysis

| Persona | Workaround satisfaction (H/M/L) | Satisfaction basis (ref. Phase 2) | Switching cost (quantified) | Habit lock-in | Social proof threshold (named condition) | Learning curve |
|---------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|

Switching cost: time, steps, rating 1--10. Qualitative-only fails.
Social proof threshold: named count, role, or condition. Binary Y/N fails.

---

## Phase 4 -- Per-Persona Inertia Scores

| Persona | Score | Methodology trace |
|---------|-------|-------------------|

Methodology trace: (a) name dimension values from Phase 3 + (b) state Phase 1 threshold
satisfied. Cite Phase 1 by copying "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED" (Citation Architecture
row 1). Do not write "Phase 1." Write the artifact name. Every persona scored individually.

---

## Phase 5 -- Kill Barrier: Four-Part Causal Analysis with Reselection Gate

**KILL BARRIER** -- four labeled, distinct sub-parts. Do not merge any two.

**(1) Barrier definition** -- observable adoption friction; state the competitive dimension.
Do not include cause.

**(2) Structural persistence** -- why the barrier persists structurally. Cite PERSONA
INVENTORY DECLARED (Citation Architecture row 2): name the specific Durability property by
its Phase 2 label. A claim without naming the PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED artifact is a
paraphrase chain.

**(3) Intervention target** -- specific lever point. Name the target, not the intervention.

**Required lever label** (Citation Architecture row 3):

> **LEVER POINT: [exact label -- 3--7 words]**

**Falsifiability test:**

> "At T=6mo, the absence of this lever would be observable as: [specific observable
> behavioral or measurable condition]."

Replace Part (3) and repeat if you cannot produce a specific observable condition. Do not
write Part (4) until the test passes.

**(4) Lever efficacy** -- why addressing (3) resolves (2). Explain causally. Reference (2)
by name.

**Temporal persistence confirmation:**

| T=0 exists? | T=18mo persists without structural intervention? |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| YES / NO | YES / NO |

Both must be YES to qualify. If either is NO, return to the top of this phase.

**CONFIRMED KILL BARRIER.** Name the most exposed persona.

---

## Phase 6 -- Adoption Timeline and Kill-Barrier Trajectory Verdict

**Part A disqualifier (required before grid):**

> "This Part A grid captures per-persona trajectory only. It does not satisfy the
> kill-barrier trajectory verdict requirement. That output belongs exclusively to Part B."

| Persona | T=0 | T=6mo | T=18mo | Trajectory | Driver of change |
|---------|-----|-------|--------|------------|-----------------|

At least one trajectory non-flat. T=6mo and T=18mo cannot copy T=0 without a stated reason.

**Part B: KILL-BARRIER TRAJECTORY VERDICT**

**Trajectory direction:** [Resolving / Stable / Worsening]

**Structural reasoning:** [Reference the structural persistence property from Phase 5(2)
by name. Argue from mechanism, not from the per-persona grid.]

**Relationship to Part A:** [Alignment or divergence -- which structural property drives both,
or why they differ.]

**Required trajectory label** (Citation Architecture row 4):

> **TRAJECTORY VERDICT: [exact direction word -- Resolving, Stable, or Worsening]**

Do not proceed to Phase 7 until written.

---

## Phase 7 -- Overall Adoption Inertia Risk

Verdict: Low / Medium / High / Critical.

- Score distribution (e.g., "2 High, 1 Critical")
- Kill-barrier trajectory: copy the exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label (Citation Architecture
  row 4). Do not write "Phase 6 Part B." Write the exact label.
- Competitive summary: kill barrier dimension + Phase 2 structural durability basis
- 1--2 sentence rationale tying score distribution, trajectory, and confirmed kill barrier

---

## Citation Chain Completeness Audit

**(Citation Architecture row 5 -- required before CCV)**

Produce the 5-column audit table using the Axis 2 column structure from AUDIT ARCHITECTURE
DECLARED above. For each link, write the actual downstream cite text in the Evidence column.
Assign Link type and Verdict from that evidence.

| Link | Source artifact | Consumer site | Evidence (write actual downstream cite text) | Link type | Verdict |
|------|----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| L1 | [exact Phase 1 artifact name] | Phase 4 methodology traces | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 4 trace that names the Phase 1 artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L2 | [exact Phase 2 artifact name] | Phase 5(2) structural persistence | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 5(2) that names the Phase 2 artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L3 | [exact LEVER POINT label] | AMEND(d) lever anchor | [write the exact text that WILL appear in AMEND(d)'s "Lever anchor:" field -- this is a forward commitment per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED; AMEND(d) copies from this cell only; Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited sources per Axis 3] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L4 | [exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label] | Phase 7 trajectory cite | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 7 that names the Phase 6 Part B artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |

**Verdict rules:**
- Reference-chain: Evidence reproduces Source artifact label verbatim. Verdict: PASS.
- Description-chain: Evidence describes or paraphrases. Verdict: CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE --
  not "weaker," not "incomplete."
- L3 forward commitment: per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED, the text you write in
  the L3 Evidence cell is the source AMEND(d) copies from. Write the exact "Lever anchor:
  [LEVER POINT label]" text as it will appear. Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited.

**Required aggregate declaration on its own line:**

> "CHAIN COMPLETE: all four links are reference chains."

-- OR --

> "CHAIN BREAK: [list link IDs with CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] -- return to Phase [X] and
> produce the required named artifact before re-auditing."

**Gate rule:** Do not proceed to CCV until CHAIN COMPLETE is written. If CHAIN BREAK, correct
and re-audit.

---

## Citation Chain Verification

Before writing AMEND, complete all six fields with named text.

1. **Phase 1 artifact name:** [exact text produced in Phase 1]
2. **Phase 2 artifact name:** [exact text produced in Phase 2]
3. **Phase 4 citation:** [exact artifact name from (1) as it appears in Phase 4 traces]
4. **Phase 5(2) citation:** [exact artifact name from (2) as it appears in Phase 5(2)]
5. **Phase 5(3) lever label:** [exact LEVER POINT label]
6. **Phase 6 Part B trajectory label:** [exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label]

A field containing "Phase X" or "see above" without the actual artifact name fails.
Correct the upstream phase before proceeding.

---

## AMEND -- Focus, Quantify, Confirm

**Focus persona:** [name -- most exposed to confirmed kill barrier]

**Switching cost (sharpened):** [most precise quantified value]

**Kill barrier for this persona:** [one sentence -- competitive dimension, most acute because]

**Mitigation with full causal chain:**

> **(a) Intervention:** [one concrete action]
>
> **(b) Root cause addressed:** [name the structural condition from Phase 5(2)]
>
> **(c) Causal mechanism:** [why this lever reaches the structural condition in (2). Reference
> the Phase 5(3) lever point by name.]
>
> **(d) Confirmation signal at T=6mo:**
>

The lever anchor must reproduce the L3 Evidence cell text exactly. The AMEND section is not
complete without the lever anchor and the observable condition.

## R13 Structural Summary

| Variation | Axes named in gate? | Partial-failure in gate? | Gate placement | C-40 predicted | C-38 | C-39 | Total |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------|--------------|----|----|----|
| V-61 | 3 (by descriptor) | YES | Block gate instruction | PASS or PARTIAL | PASS | PASS | 400 or 395 |
| V-62 | 1 (Axis 3 only) | YES (Axis 3) | Block gate instruction | PARTIAL | PASS | PASS | 395 |
| V-63 | 3 (by "Axis N") | NO | Block gate instruction | PARTIAL | PASS | PASS | 395 |
| V-64 | 3 (by "Axis N") | YES | Block gate instruction | PASS | PASS | PASS | 400 |
| V-65 | 3 (by "Axis N") | YES | Required label only | FAIL or PARTIAL | PASS | PASS | 390 or 395 |

**Key isolation:**
- V-61 vs. V-64: Naming form -- descriptor vs. "Axis N" ordinal. Does "by label" require ordinal?
- V-62 vs. V-64: Axis count -- 1 of 3 named vs. 3 of 3. Confirms PARTIAL for fewer-than-three.
- V-63 vs. V-64: Impossibility -- axes named but no partial-failure clause. PARTIAL or FAIL?
- V-65 vs. V-64: Placement -- gate in label vs. gate in block instruction. Does location matter?
- V-62 vs. V-63: Two different PARTIAL conditions -- do both score 5 pts symmetrically?
