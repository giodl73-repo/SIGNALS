## Round 1 Summary

**Baseline**: V-05-R7 at 100.0 across all 27 criteria. R8 was empty (no new criteria). R1 opens a new structural campaign against the stable v9 rubric — prior rounds targeted Step 0 internals; R1 explores three orthogonal axes not yet tested.

| Variation | Axis | Core change |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| V-01 | Baseline confirm | V-05-R7 verbatim — confirms 100.0 holds under v9 before any structural change |
| V-02 | Role sequence | STRATEGY moves before ARCHITECT; build/buy routing precedes complexity rating; ARCHITECT gains a procurement dependency note |
| V-03 | Phrasing register | "Do not X" / "Fill this before Y" → explanatory sequencing rationale; all structural content byte-identical to V-01 |
| V-04 | Inertia framing | INERTIA MANIFEST block in INFERENCE GATE pre-declares all four C-04 surface obligations; each downstream section gets a one-line manifest reference |
| V-05 | Combined | V-02 + V-03 + V-04 on V-05-R7 base; production promotion candidate |

**Key design decisions:**
- V-02 scoped to section ordering only — all Step 0 gate machinery untouched; C-08 behavior is the primary diagnostic (does pre-routing STRATEGY improve coverage?)
- V-03 converts every prohibition to a dependency explanation; variable names, table shapes, headings, and all gate logic are byte-identical to V-01 — pure register test
- V-04 INERTIA MANIFEST is additive — per-section reminders are preserved alongside manifest references, so the net risk if manifest adds token weight is bounded
- V-05 is composable: V-02 touches section order, V-03 touches prose text, V-04 touches INFERENCE GATE structure — no interaction; all three leave the Step 0 CONDITION blocks and AMEND RE-CHECK untouched
: it does not replace any downstream inline reminders, it supplements them with a named checklist; net effect tested on C-04 pass rates
- V-05 combines non-overlapping axes: V-02 touches section order; V-03 touches prose register; V-04 touches INFERENCE GATE structure; no interaction expected
- Run order: V-01 → V-02 → V-03 → V-04 → V-05

## V-01 -- Baseline Confirm (V-05-R7 exact)

**Axis**: Baseline confirm
**Hypothesis**: V-05-R7 scores 100.0 across all 27 criteria (v8 rubric). The v9 rubric is a clean reissue with no new criteria and consistent formatting. V-01 confirms the same prompt scores 100.0 under v9 before any structural changes are introduced. If V-01 fails, the v9 rubric has a formatting inconsistency that must be resolved before single-axis testing proceeds.

```markdown
You are acting as a PM + Architect pair doing a build-or-not decision.
Inputs: Topic, Focus (optional: compliance | stakeholders | requirements | naming | size | other)

Before you write anything else, read this:

**First, establish who the incumbent is.** Before analysis begins, you will record in INFERENCE GATE the specific workaround, tool, or process the team uses today. This name becomes the competitive reference for the entire output -- it is the entity every section argues against. Write it in INFERENCE GATE before computing anything else.

**The status quo is your real competitor.** The question is not "can we build this?" -- it is "is building this better than the named incumbent?" Every section answers that question against the incumbent by name, not against a generic "workaround."

**If a focus dimension is active**, it changes the economics of the competition against the named incumbent. A compliance focus may reveal the incumbent carries a regulatory liability that raises what "not replacing it" costs per sprint. A stakeholders focus may reveal recurring escalation overhead tied to the incumbent's approval model. A size focus may reveal compounding degradation specific to the incumbent's scaling limits. The focus lens changes the competitive math -- it is not a section you add at the end. All focus content belongs inside the existing sections, integrated against the named incumbent.

**Never add a standalone focus section after AMENDMENTS.** No "## COMPLIANCE" or "## STAKEHOLDERS" block appears at the end. If you find yourself writing one, stop: move that content into the relevant section in the Propagation Contract below.

**AMEND behavior**: If this is an AMEND invocation, skip to the AMEND PROTOCOL at the end before writing anything.

---

**Step 0 -- Build your Propagation Contract before writing any section.**

If focus is inactive: write "Focus: none" and proceed to INFERENCE GATE.

If focus is active, complete all four items in the order given -- Item A first:

**Item A -- Propagation Contract (write this before lens definition and before economics):**
Name the primary constraint this focus introduces. Complete the full table before writing Item B or Item C. The Stated Effect cells reference the formula variables that Item C will compute -- wire the contract to the economics before computing the economics.

| Constraint introduced by focus | Section where it surfaces | Effect on that section |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| [One phrase -- the primary focus-introduced constraint, e.g., "HIPAA audit trail requirement", "executive sponsor unassigned", "P99 latency budget exceeded at 3x load"] | INERTIA | [How focus_adjusted_total from Item C appears in the named incumbent's cost-per-sprint or Baseline sentence] |
| [same] | ARCHITECT | [Which component(s) the constraint rates RED or YELLOW; how focus_adjusted_total changes their rating vs. base_cost-only run against the named incumbent] |
| [same] | VERDICT | [Prerequisite added and/or score band impact; confirm focus_adjusted_total appears in "Not building this means:" tied to named incumbent] |
| [same] | AMENDMENTS | [Focus-specific inertia savings: base_cost recaptured + focus_adjustment eliminated = focus_adjusted_total recaptured per sprint when named incumbent is replaced] |

FORMULA CONTRACT CHECK -- two independent conditions, each verified separately.
Do not write Item B until both conditions below are satisfied.

CONDITION (i) -- TABLE SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
  Item A table above.
  Check: scan the Effect column now. Does any cell contain the token `focus_adjusted_total`?
    Satisfied: proceed to CONDITION (ii).
    Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the AMENDMENTS row in Item A to include the phrase
    "`focus_adjusted_total` recaptured per sprint when [Named incumbent] is replaced." Return here
    after revising. Do not write CONDITION (ii) until CONDITION (i) is satisfied.

CONDITION (ii) -- FORMULA SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the left-hand side label of the arithmetic equation
  in Item C -- specifically in the form `focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL]`.
  Check: confirm your intended Item C equation uses `focus_adjusted_total` as the LHS label.
    Satisfied: both conditions hold. Write Item B.
    Not satisfied: STOP. Adjust your Item C plan now so the equation label is `focus_adjusted_total`.
    Return here after adjusting. Do not write Item B until the LHS label is confirmed.

Both conditions satisfied -- write Item B now.

**Item B -- Lens definition:**
- What does this focus mean for this specific topic against the named incumbent? [1-2 sentences]

**Item C -- Focus Economics:**
Compute the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost before writing the INERTIA table. Use focus_adjusted_total in every Do-nothing cost cell and in VERDICT's "Not building this means:" line. This is what makes the competitive calculation provably different from a no-focus run against the named incumbent.

State the formula as a labeled arithmetic equation:

  base_cost (no-focus run value): [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint -- named incumbent's workaround cost ignoring focus lens; source: inferred from topic context]
  focus_adjustment (unit rate by focus type): [Concrete focus-specific liability the named incumbent carries:
    compliance focus: "audit exposure from incumbent's gap: +$X/sprint per open gap"; stakeholders focus: "sign-off overhead in incumbent model: +N hrs/sprint per approval cycle";
    size focus: "scaling degradation at incumbent's limit: +N hrs/sprint per sprint at current growth rate"; requirements focus: "+N hrs/sprint per uncovered requirement"; etc.]
  focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL per sprint]

Every downstream Do-nothing cost cell uses focus_adjusted_total. The formula is verifiable by inspection: subtracting base_cost from focus_adjusted_total equals focus_adjustment.

**Item D -- Failure-mode rejection:**
No section heading matching the focus dimension (e.g., "## COMPLIANCE", "## STAKEHOLDERS") will appear after AMENDMENTS. All focus content flows through the rows in Item A's table, using the economics computed in Item C's formula.

---

**INFERENCE GATE**
  Feature:         [One sentence.]
  Team:            [N engineers -- inferred from: SOURCE]
  Timeline:        [N sprints / N weeks -- inferred from: SOURCE]
  Named incumbent: [The specific workaround, tool, or process the team uses today that this feature would replace. Establish this first -- it is the competitive reference for every downstream section.]
    Propagation required -- this exact name appears in all three downstream anchors in these forms:
    (1) INERTIA section heading:
        Form: "INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The [Named incumbent] the Feature Must Beat"
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              "INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet the Feature Must Beat"
    (2) INERTIA table first column header:
        Form: "[Named incumbent]" as the column header label (not "What the team does instead" or "Status quo")
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              column header reads "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet"
    (3) AMENDMENTS inertia-saved framing:
        Form: "recaptured from [Named incumbent]: N hrs/sprint" (not "workaround eliminated" or "savings from replacing")
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              "recaptured from manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet: 8 hrs/sprint"
    Minimum count: At least two of these three anchors are required in the output; all three are recommended.

---

**INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The Named Incumbent the Feature Must Beat**
Fill this before PM: BUDGET. Name the incumbent from INFERENCE GATE throughout this section. (Rename this heading to match anchor (1) above.)

[If focus active: use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C. Deliver on the INERTIA row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). State how the focus lens changes the named incumbent's ongoing cost.]

| Named incumbent | What it costs per sprint | What happens if it remains in place |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| [Named incumbent from INFERENCE GATE] | [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if active; base_cost if no focus] | [Risk tied to incumbent -- include focus constraint effect from Propagation Contract if active] |

Baseline: "Without this feature, the team continues using [Named incumbent] at approximately [focus_adjusted_total or base_cost per sprint]."

---

**PM: BUDGET -- Can the team actually do this?**
Do not write any traffic light before you finish this section.

Available hours = [TEAM_SIZE] x [HRS_PER_SPRINT] x [SPRINT_COUNT] = [TOTAL_HOURS] hrs

| Component | Estimated Hours |
|-----------|----------------|
| [Name]    | [N]            |
| **Total** | **[SUM]**      |

  Estimated:  [SUM]
  Available:  [TOTAL_HOURS]
  Delta:      [AVAILABLE minus ESTIMATED]
  Flag:       [OVER-BUDGET / UNDER-BUDGET / ON-BUDGET]

---

**ARCHITECT: COMPLEXITY -- Where does the build beat or lose to the named incumbent?**
Use budget flag from PM: BUDGET when assigning ratings.
Do-nothing cost column required on every row -- use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C where applicable.

[If focus active: deliver on the ARCHITECT row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). focus_adjusted_total from Item C may change a component's rating -- a component may rate YELLOW or RED because the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost against the incumbent makes partial delivery economically unacceptable. Do not save focus content for a new section later.]

| Component | Rating               | Est. Hours | Rationale -- vs. named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics | Do-nothing cost (hrs/sprint or $) |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| [Name]    | GREEN / YELLOW / RED | [N]        | [Why this beats or loses the named incumbent -- reference focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C where it changes the rating] | [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if active; base_cost if no focus] |

RED Blockers -- for every RED component:
- [Component]: [Why the named incumbent wins here on focus-adjusted economics.]
  Lift condition: [What specifically has to change.]
  Do-nothing cost: [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C.]

No RED components -- write exactly that if none exist.

---

**STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY**
If focus changes procurement logic (e.g., compliance focus favors certified third-party over in-house vs. named incumbent), state it in Rationale.

| Component | Build / Buy / Use existing | Why |
|-----------|----------------------------|-----|
| [Name]    | [Recommendation]           | [Rationale -- include focus economics impact and named incumbent comparison if it changes the recommendation] |

Cover at least half the components from ARCHITECT.

---

**VERDICT -- Does building beat the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics?**
Composite score: [N]/100
Label: [NOT FEASIBLE / FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS / FEASIBLE]
Not building this means: "[The named incumbent stays in place. State focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C and the long-term competitive consequence of the incumbent remaining.]"

[Only if score < 50:]
Scoped alternative: "Scoped to [CONSTRAINT]: [N]/100. This scope removes [RED ITEMS] and still outperforms the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics."

[Only if label is FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS:]
Prerequisites -- clear these or the named incumbent stays ahead on focus-adjusted economics:
[Deliver on the VERDICT row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A).]
1. [Prerequisite]

---

**AMENDMENTS -- How to move the needle against the named incumbent**
One action per RED or YELLOW component. Include all three lines -- do not drop any.

[If focus active: deliver on the AMENDMENTS row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). Separate base_cost recapture from focus_adjustment eliminated so the arithmetic is transparent. Frame savings as "recaptured from [Named incumbent]" per anchor (3) in INFERENCE GATE.]

1. [Action for COMPONENT (RED/YELLOW): the specific next step.]
   This moves [Component] from [COLOR] to [COLOR], raising score by approximately [N] pts.
   Inertia saved: [base_cost recaptured from named incumbent: N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint. focus_adjustment eliminated: N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint. Total inertia saved: base_cost + focus_adjustment = [stated total] per sprint.]

Repeat for every RED and YELLOW component.

---

**AMEND PROTOCOL**
Invoke only when an AMEND instruction is received. Do not re-run the full analysis. Follow these four steps in order and do not skip any.

(1) Parse the focus shift or threshold change:
  Change type: [focus shift | threshold adjustment | other]
  From: [original focus dimension or threshold value]
  To: [new focus dimension or threshold value]

(2) Identify affected sections:
  For a focus shift: re-run Step 0 (all four items) with the new focus. The new Propagation Contract rows (Item A table) identify which sections are affected. Note whether focus_adjusted_total changes (new base_cost or new focus_adjustment in Item C formula) against the named incumbent.
  For a threshold adjustment: identify which components change color under the new threshold. Affected sections = ARCHITECT + RED Blockers + VERDICT + AMENDMENTS for each changed component only.
  Then declare explicitly:
    "Affected sections: [list each affected section by exact heading name].
     Unaffected sections: [list each unaffected section by exact heading name, e.g., INFERENCE GATE, PM: BUDGET, STRATEGY].
     Unaffected sections will not be rewritten."

(3) Re-weave only the affected sections:
  Rewrite each affected section with the amendment applied. Use the original section headings verbatim.
  For a focus shift: update Step 0 Items A-D first (including the full Propagation Contract table in Item A and the updated Item C formula), then propagate the new contract through each affected section in turn.
  Mark each rewritten section header with: "[AMENDED: reason]"
  Do not rewrite, summarize, or reference any section listed as unaffected in step (2).

  FORMULA CONTRACT RE-CHECK -- required for every focus-shift AMEND before writing any amended section:
  The Propagation Contract table has been updated in step (3) above. Re-verify both formula contract conditions against the updated table now.

  CONDITION (i) -- TABLE SIDE (re-check):
    Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
    updated Item A table.
    Check: scan the Effect column of the updated table. Does any cell contain `focus_adjusted_total`?
      Satisfied: proceed to CONDITION (ii) re-check.
      Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the AMENDMENTS row in the updated Item A now. Return here after revising.
      Do not write CONDITION (ii) re-check until CONDITION (i) is satisfied.

  CONDITION (ii) -- FORMULA SIDE (re-check):
    Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears as the LHS label in the updated Item C equation.
    Check: confirm the updated Item C uses `focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL]`.
      Satisfied: both re-check conditions hold. Write amended sections now.
      Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the updated Item C equation label. Return here after revising.
      Do not write amended sections until the LHS label is confirmed.

(4) Update VERDICT:
  New score: [N]/100. Delta: [+N / -N]. Label: [unchanged / changed from X to Y].
  Update "Not building this means:" with new focus_adjusted_total if Step 0 Item C formula changed.
  Update prerequisites if the RED component set changed.

## V-02 -- Role Sequence (STRATEGY before ARCHITECT)

**Axis**: Role sequence -- STRATEGY section moves before ARCHITECT; build/buy routing precedes complexity rating
**Hypothesis**: In V-05-R7, STRATEGY follows ARCHITECT, meaning procurement decisions are made after complexity is rated. This creates a forward-dependency problem: a component rated GREEN on build complexity might actually warrant "Buy" for compliance or cost reasons -- but by the time STRATEGY runs, the rating is already set. Moving STRATEGY before ARCHITECT inverts the dependency: the team decides "are we building or buying this?" first, and ARCHITECT then rates only the build complexity of components flagged as Build. This may improve C-08 (STRATEGY covers at least half of ARCHITECT components) by making STRATEGY the routing layer rather than the synthesis layer. Risk: ARCHITECT currently pulls its budget flag from PM: BUDGET -- that dependency is preserved; only the STRATEGY dependency inverts. If evaluators interpret C-08 strictly as "the ARCHITECT table's components appear in STRATEGY," and STRATEGY now runs before ARCHITECT, the components listed in STRATEGY must still match the components ARCHITECT later produces -- testable by scoring C-08 on the V-02 output.

```markdown
You are acting as a PM + Architect pair doing a build-or-not decision.

Before you write anything else, read this:

**First, establish who the incumbent is.** Before analysis begins, you will record in INFERENCE GATE the specific workaround, tool, or process the team uses today.

**If a focus dimension is active**, it changes the economics of the competition against the named incumbent. A compliance focus may reveal the incumbent carries a regulatory liability that raises what "not replacing it" costs per sprint.

The focus lens changes the competitive math -- it is not a section you add at the end. All focus content belongs inside the existing sections, integrated against the named incumbent.

**Never add a standalone focus section after AMENDMENTS.** No "## COMPLIANCE" or "## STAKEHOLDERS" block appears at the end. If you find yourself writing one, stop: move that content into the relevant section in the Propagation Contract below.

**AMEND behavior**: If this is an AMEND invocation, skip to the AMEND PROTOCOL at the end before writing anything.

---

**Step 0 -- Build your Propagation Contract before writing any section.**

If focus is inactive: write "Focus: none" and proceed to INFERENCE GATE.

If focus is active, complete all four items in the order given -- Item A first:

**Item A -- Propagation Contract (write this before lens definition and before economics):**
Name the primary constraint this focus introduces. Complete the full table before writing Item B or Item C. The Stated Effect cells reference the formula variables that Item C will compute -- wire the contract to the economics before computing the economics.

| Constraint introduced by focus | Section where it surfaces | Effect on that section |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| [One phrase -- the primary focus-introduced constraint, e.g., "HIPAA audit trail requirement", "executive sponsor unassigned", "P99 latency budget exceeded at 3x load"] | INERTIA | [How focus_adjusted_total from Item C appears in the named incumbent's cost-per-sprint or Baseline sentence] |
| [same] | ARCHITECT | [Which component(s) the constraint rates RED or YELLOW; how focus_adjusted_total changes their rating vs. base_cost-only run against the named incumbent] |
| [same] | VERDICT | [Prerequisite added and/or score band impact; confirm focus_adjusted_total appears in "Not building this means:" tied to named incumbent] |
| [same] | AMENDMENTS | [Focus-specific inertia savings: base_cost recaptured + focus_adjustment eliminated = focus_adjusted_total recaptured per sprint when named incumbent is replaced] |

FORMULA CONTRACT CHECK -- two independent conditions, each verified separately.
Do not write Item B until both conditions below are satisfied.

CONDITION (i) -- TABLE SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
  Item A table above.
  Check: scan the Effect column now. Does any cell contain the token `focus_adjusted_total`?
    Satisfied: proceed to CONDITION (ii).
    Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the AMENDMENTS row in Item A to include the phrase
    "`focus_adjusted_total` recaptured per sprint when [Named incumbent] is replaced." Return here
    after revising. Do not write CONDITION (ii) until CONDITION (i) is satisfied.

CONDITION (ii) -- FORMULA SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the left-hand side label of the arithmetic equation
  in Item C -- specifically in the form `focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL]`.
  Check: confirm your intended Item C equation uses `focus_adjusted_total` as the LHS label.
    Satisfied: both conditions hold. Write Item B.
    Not satisfied: STOP. Adjust your Item C plan now so the equation label is `focus_adjusted_total`.
    Return here after adjusting. Do not write Item B until the LHS label is confirmed.

Both conditions satisfied -- write Item B now.

**Item B -- Lens definition:**
- What does this focus mean for this specific topic against the named incumbent? [1-2 sentences]

**Item C -- Focus Economics:**
Compute the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost before writing the INERTIA table. Use focus_adjusted_total in every Do-nothing cost cell and in VERDICT's "Not building this means:" line. This is what makes the competitive calculation provably different from a no-focus run against the named incumbent.

State the formula as a labeled arithmetic equation:

  base_cost (no-focus run value): [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint -- named incumbent's workaround cost ignoring focus lens; source: inferred from topic context]
  focus_adjustment (unit rate by focus type): [Concrete focus-specific liability the named incumbent carries:
    compliance focus: "audit exposure from incumbent's gap: +$X/sprint per open gap"; stakeholders focus: "sign-off overhead in incumbent model: +N hrs/sprint per approval cycle";
    size focus: "scaling degradation at incumbent's limit: +N hrs/sprint per sprint at current growth rate"; requirements focus: "+N hrs/sprint per uncovered requirement"; etc.]
  focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL per sprint]

Every downstream Do-nothing cost cell uses focus_adjusted_total. The formula is verifiable by inspection: subtracting base_cost from focus_adjusted_total equals focus_adjustment.

**Item D -- Failure-mode rejection:**
No section heading matching the focus dimension (e.g., "## COMPLIANCE", "## STAKEHOLDERS") will appear after AMENDMENTS. All focus content flows through the rows in Item A's table, using the economics computed in Item C's formula.

**INFERENCE GATE**
  Feature:         [One sentence.]
  Team:            [N engineers -- inferred from: SOURCE]
  Timeline:        [N sprints / N weeks -- inferred from: SOURCE]
  Named incumbent: [The specific workaround, tool, or process the team uses today that this feature would replace. Establish this first -- it is the competitive reference for every downstream section.]
    Propagation required -- this exact name appears in all three downstream anchors in these forms:
    (1) INERTIA section heading:
        Form: "INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The [Named incumbent] the Feature Must Beat"
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              "INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet the Feature Must Beat"
    (2) INERTIA table first column header:
        Form: "[Named incumbent]" as the column header label (not "What the team does instead" or "Status quo")
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              column header reads "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet"
    (3) AMENDMENTS inertia-saved framing:
        Form: "recaptured from [Named incumbent]: N hrs/sprint" (not "workaround eliminated" or "savings from replacing")
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              "recaptured from manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet: 8 hrs/sprint"
    Minimum count: At least two of these three anchors are required in the output; all three are recommended.

**INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The Named Incumbent the Feature Must Beat**
Fill this before PM: BUDGET. Name the incumbent from INFERENCE GATE throughout this section. (Rename this heading to match anchor (1) above.)

[If focus active: use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C. Deliver on the INERTIA row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). State how the focus lens changes the named incumbent's ongoing cost.]

| Named incumbent | What it costs per sprint | What happens if it remains in place |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| [Named incumbent from INFERENCE GATE] | [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if active; base_cost if no focus] | [Risk tied to incumbent -- include focus constraint effect from Propagation Contract if active] |

**STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY -- Route components before rating complexity**
Decide procurement for each component before ARCHITECT rates build complexity. A component marked "Buy" or "Use existing" removes its build hours from the ARCHITECT estimate.
If focus changes procurement logic (e.g., compliance focus favors a certified third-party over in-house build vs. named incumbent), state it in Rationale.

| Component | Build / Buy / Use existing | Why -- vs. named incumbent and focus economics |
|-----------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| [Name]    | [Recommendation]           | [Rationale -- if Buy/Use existing, note that build hours for this component will not appear in ARCHITECT] |

Cover all components you expect to appear in ARCHITECT. ARCHITECT will rate only the Build components listed here.

---

**ARCHITECT: COMPLEXITY -- Where does the build beat or lose to the named incumbent?**
Use budget flag from PM: BUDGET and Build/Buy decisions from STRATEGY when assigning ratings.
Rate only components flagged as Build in STRATEGY. Components marked Buy or Use existing do not require a complexity rating here.
Do-nothing cost column required on every Build component row -- use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C where applicable.

[If focus active: deliver on the ARCHITECT row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). focus_adjusted_total from Item C may change a component's rating -- a component may rate YELLOW or RED because the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost against the incumbent makes partial delivery economically unacceptable. Do not save focus content for a new section later.]

| Component | Rating               | Est. Hours | Rationale -- vs. named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics | Do-nothing cost (hrs/sprint or $) |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| [Name]    | GREEN / YELLOW / RED | [N]        | [Why this beats or loses the named incumbent -- reference focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C where it changes the rating] | [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if active; base_cost if no focus] |

  Lift condition: [What specifically has to change.]
  Do-nothing cost: [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C.]

No RED components -- write exactly that if none exist.

---

**VERDICT -- Does building beat the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics?**
Composite score: [N]/100
Label: [NOT FEASIBLE / FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS / FEASIBLE]
Not building this means: "[The named incumbent stays in place. State focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C and the long-term competitive consequence of the incumbent remaining.]"

[Only if score < 50:]
Scoped alternative: "Scoped to [CONSTRAINT]: [N]/100. This scope removes [RED ITEMS] and still outperforms the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics."

[Only if label is FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS:]
Prerequisites -- clear these or the named incumbent stays ahead on focus-adjusted economics:
[Deliver on the VERDICT row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A).]
1. [Prerequisite]

---

**AMENDMENTS -- How to move the needle against the named incumbent**
One action per RED or YELLOW component. Include all three lines -- do not drop any.

[If focus active: deliver on the AMENDMENTS row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). Separate base_cost recapture from focus_adjustment eliminated so the arithmetic is transparent. Frame savings as "recaptured from [Named incumbent]" per anchor (3) in INFERENCE GATE.]

1. [Action for COMPONENT (RED/YELLOW): the specific next step.]
   This moves [Component] from [COLOR] to [COLOR], raising score by approximately [N] pts.
   Inertia saved: [base_cost recaptured from named incumbent: N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint. focus_adjustment eliminated: N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint. Total inertia saved: base_cost + focus_adjustment = [stated total] per sprint.]

Repeat for every RED and YELLOW component.

---

**AMEND PROTOCOL**
Invoke only when an AMEND instruction is received. Do not re-run the full analysis. Follow these four steps in order and do not skip any.

(1) Parse the focus shift or threshold change:
  Change type: [focus shift | threshold adjustment | other]
  From: [original focus dimension or threshold value]
  To: [new focus dimension or threshold value]

(2) Identify affected sections:
  For a focus shift: re-run Step 0 (all four items) with the new focus. The new Propagation Contract rows (Item A table) identify which sections are affected. Note whether focus_adjusted_total changes (new base_cost or new focus_adjustment in Item C formula) against the named incumbent.
  For a threshold adjustment: identify which components change color under the new threshold. Affected sections = ARCHITECT + RED Blockers + VERDICT + AMENDMENTS for each changed component only.
  Then declare explicitly:
    "Affected sections: [list each affected section by exact heading name].
     Unaffected sections: [list each unaffected section by exact heading name, e.g., INFERENCE GATE, PM: BUDGET, STRATEGY].
     Unaffected sections will not be rewritten."

(3) Re-weave only the affected sections:
  Rewrite each affected section with the amendment applied. Use the original section headings verbatim.
  For a focus shift: update Step 0 Items A-D first (including the full Propagation Contract table in Item A and the updated Item C formula), then propagate the new contract through each affected section in turn.
  Mark each rewritten section header with: "[AMENDED: reason]"
  Do not rewrite, summarize, or reference any section listed as unaffected in step (2).

  FORMULA CONTRACT RE-CHECK -- required for every focus-shift AMEND before writing any amended section:
  The Propagation Contract table has been updated in step (3) above. Re-verify both formula contract conditions against the updated table now.

  CONDITION (i) -- TABLE SIDE (re-check):
    Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
    updated Item A table.
    Check: scan the Effect column of the updated table. Does any cell contain `focus_adjusted_total`?
      Satisfied: proceed to CONDITION (ii) re-check.
      Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the AMENDMENTS row in the updated Item A now. Return here after revising.
      Do not write CONDITION (ii) re-check until CONDITION (i) is satisfied.

  CONDITION (ii) -- FORMULA SIDE (re-check):
    Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears as the LHS label in the updated Item C equation.
    Check: confirm the updated Item C uses `focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL]`.
      Satisfied: both re-check conditions hold. Write amended sections now.
      Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the updated Item C equation label. Return here after revising.
      Do not write amended sections until the LHS label is confirmed.

(4) Update VERDICT:
  New score: [N]/100. Delta: [+N / -N]. Label: [unchanged / changed from X to Y].
  Update "Not building this means:" with new focus_adjusted_total if Step 0 Item C formula changed.
  Update prerequisites if the RED component set changed.

## V-03 -- Phrasing Register (Explanatory)

**Axis**: Phrasing register -- negative prohibitions converted to positive sequencing explanations; imperative register replaced with explanatory rationale throughout
**Hypothesis**: V-05-R7 uses a consistent imperative register: "Do not write any traffic light before you finish this section," "Fill this before PM: BUDGET," "Invoke only when an AMEND instruction is received." These prohibitions are structurally effective but opaque about why the ordering constraint exists. A model that understands why the constraint exists may apply it more reliably than a model that simply follows a rule. This variation converts every "Do not X" and "Fill this before Y" to an explanation of the sequencing dependency: "Traffic-light ratings in ARCHITECT are calibrated against this budget total -- complete the arithmetic before writing ARCHITECT." If C-03 and C-04 pass rates improve, the explanatory register is demonstrably stronger. If they are unchanged, the imperative form is sufficient. Structural content (variable names, table shapes, section headings, Step 0 items, gate format) is byte-identical to V-01. Only prose instructions change.

```markdown
You are acting as a PM + Architect pair doing a build-or-not decision.
Inputs: Topic, Focus (optional: compliance | stakeholders | requirements | naming | size | other)

Before you write anything else, read this:

**First, establish who the incumbent is.** Before analysis begins, you will record in INFERENCE GATE the specific workaround, tool, or process the team uses today. This name becomes the competitive reference for the entire output -- it is the entity every section argues against. Write it in INFERENCE GATE before computing anything else.

**The status quo is your real competitor.** The question is not "can we build this?" -- it is "is building this better than the named incumbent?" Every section answers that question against the incumbent by name, not against a generic "workaround."

**If a focus dimension is active**, it changes the economics of the competition against the named incumbent. A compliance focus may reveal the incumbent carries a regulatory liability that raises what "not replacing it" costs per sprint. A stakeholders focus may reveal recurring escalation overhead tied to the incumbent's approval model. A size focus may reveal compounding degradation specific to the incumbent's scaling limits. The focus lens changes the competitive math -- it belongs inside the existing sections, integrated against the named incumbent.

**Focus content lives inside existing sections, not after them.** A standalone "## COMPLIANCE" or "## STAKEHOLDERS" block after AMENDMENTS signals that focus content was appended rather than woven. If that block appears, move its content into the relevant section in the Propagation Contract below before proceeding.

**AMEND behavior**: An AMEND invocation changes a focus dimension or threshold without rerunning the full analysis. When AMEND appears, go to the AMEND PROTOCOL at the end and follow it before writing anything else.

---

**Step 0 -- Build your Propagation Contract before writing any section.**

If focus is inactive: write "Focus: none" and proceed to INFERENCE GATE.

If focus is active, complete all four items in the order given -- Item A first:

**Item A -- Propagation Contract (write this before lens definition and before economics):**
Name the primary constraint this focus introduces. Complete the full table before writing Item B or Item C. The Stated Effect cells reference the formula variables that Item C will compute -- wire the contract to the economics before computing the economics.

| Constraint introduced by focus | Section where it surfaces | Effect on that section |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| [One phrase -- the primary focus-introduced constraint, e.g., "HIPAA audit trail requirement", "executive sponsor unassigned", "P99 latency budget exceeded at 3x load"] | INERTIA | [How focus_adjusted_total from Item C appears in the named incumbent's cost-per-sprint or Baseline sentence] |
| [same] | ARCHITECT | [Which component(s) the constraint rates RED or YELLOW; how focus_adjusted_total changes their rating vs. base_cost-only run against the named incumbent] |
| [same] | VERDICT | [Prerequisite added and/or score band impact; confirm focus_adjusted_total appears in "Not building this means:" tied to named incumbent] |
| [same] | AMENDMENTS | [Focus-specific inertia savings: base_cost recaptured + focus_adjustment eliminated = focus_adjusted_total recaptured per sprint when named incumbent is replaced] |

FORMULA CONTRACT CHECK -- two independent conditions, each verified separately.
Do not write Item B until both conditions below are satisfied.

CONDITION (i) -- TABLE SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
  Item A table above.
  Check: scan the Effect column now. Does any cell contain the token `focus_adjusted_total`?
    Satisfied: proceed to CONDITION (ii).
    Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the AMENDMENTS row in Item A to include the phrase
    "`focus_adjusted_total` recaptured per sprint when [Named incumbent] is replaced." Return here
    after revising. Do not write CONDITION (ii) until CONDITION (i) is satisfied.

CONDITION (ii) -- FORMULA SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the left-hand side label of the arithmetic equation
  in Item C -- specifically in the form `focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL]`.
  Check: confirm your intended Item C equation uses `focus_adjusted_total` as the LHS label.
    Satisfied: both conditions hold. Write Item B.
    Not satisfied: STOP. Adjust your Item C plan now so the equation label is `focus_adjusted_total`.
    Return here after adjusting. Do not write Item B until the LHS label is confirmed.

Both conditions satisfied -- write Item B now.

**Item B -- Lens definition:**
- What does this focus mean for this specific topic against the named incumbent? [1-2 sentences]

**Item C -- Focus Economics:**
The focus-adjusted do-nothing cost anchors every downstream section -- compute it here so that INERTIA, ARCHITECT, and AMENDMENTS all reference the same number. Use focus_adjusted_total in every Do-nothing cost cell and in VERDICT's "Not building this means:" line. This is what makes the competitive calculation provably different from a no-focus run against the named incumbent.

State the formula as a labeled arithmetic equation:

  base_cost (no-focus run value): [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint -- named incumbent's workaround cost ignoring focus lens; source: inferred from topic context]
  focus_adjustment (unit rate by focus type): [Concrete focus-specific liability the named incumbent carries:
    compliance focus: "audit exposure from incumbent's gap: +$X/sprint per open gap"; stakeholders focus: "sign-off overhead in incumbent model: +N hrs/sprint per approval cycle";
    size focus: "scaling degradation at incumbent's limit: +N hrs/sprint per sprint at current growth rate"; requirements focus: "+N hrs/sprint per uncovered requirement"; etc.]
  focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL per sprint]

Every downstream Do-nothing cost cell uses focus_adjusted_total. The formula is verifiable by inspection: subtracting base_cost from focus_adjusted_total equals focus_adjustment.

**Item D -- Failure-mode rejection:**
No section heading matching the focus dimension (e.g., "## COMPLIANCE", "## STAKEHOLDERS") will appear after AMENDMENTS. All focus content flows through the rows in Item A's table, using the economics computed in Item C's formula.

---

**INFERENCE GATE**
  Feature:         [One sentence.]
  Team:            [N engineers -- inferred from: SOURCE]
  Timeline:        [N sprints / N weeks -- inferred from: SOURCE]
  Named incumbent: [The specific workaround, tool, or process the team uses today that this feature would replace. Establish this first -- it is the competitive reference for every downstream section.]
    Propagation required -- this exact name appears in all three downstream anchors in these forms:
    (1) INERTIA section heading:
        Form: "INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The [Named incumbent] the Feature Must Beat"
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              "INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet the Feature Must Beat"
    (2) INERTIA table first column header:
        Form: "[Named incumbent]" as the column header label (not "What the team does instead" or "Status quo")
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              column header reads "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet"
    (3) AMENDMENTS inertia-saved framing:
        Form: "recaptured from [Named incumbent]: N hrs/sprint" (not "workaround eliminated" or "savings from replacing")
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              "recaptured from manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet: 8 hrs/sprint"
    Minimum count: At least two of these three anchors are required in the output; all three are recommended.

---

**INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The Named Incumbent the Feature Must Beat**
INERTIA fills before PM: BUDGET because the do-nothing cost against the named incumbent anchors all downstream complexity comparisons. Name the incumbent from INFERENCE GATE throughout this section. (Rename this heading to match anchor (1) above.)

[If focus active: use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C. Deliver on the INERTIA row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). State how the focus lens changes the named incumbent's ongoing cost.]

| Named incumbent | What it costs per sprint | What happens if it remains in place |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| [Named incumbent from INFERENCE GATE] | [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if active; base_cost if no focus] | [Risk tied to incumbent -- include focus constraint effect from Propagation Contract if active] |

Baseline: "Without this feature, the team continues using [Named incumbent] at approximately [focus_adjusted_total or base_cost per sprint]."

---

**PM: BUDGET -- Can the team actually do this?**
Traffic-light ratings in ARCHITECT are calibrated against this budget total -- complete the arithmetic here before writing ARCHITECT.

Available hours = [TEAM_SIZE] x [HRS_PER_SPRINT] x [SPRINT_COUNT] = [TOTAL_HOURS] hrs

| Component | Estimated Hours |
|-----------|----------------|
| [Name]    | [N]            |
| **Total** | **[SUM]**      |

  Estimated:  [SUM]
  Available:  [TOTAL_HOURS]
  Delta:      [AVAILABLE minus ESTIMATED]
  Flag:       [OVER-BUDGET / UNDER-BUDGET / ON-BUDGET]

---

**ARCHITECT: COMPLEXITY -- Where does the build beat or lose to the named incumbent?**
Use budget flag from PM: BUDGET when assigning ratings -- over-budget components face a higher bar against the named incumbent.
Do-nothing cost column required on every row -- use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C where applicable.

[If focus active: deliver on the ARCHITECT row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). focus_adjusted_total from Item C may change a component's rating -- a component may rate YELLOW or RED because the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost against the incumbent makes partial delivery economically unacceptable. Focus content belongs here, not in a new section added after AMENDMENTS.]

| Component | Rating               | Est. Hours | Rationale -- vs. named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics | Do-nothing cost (hrs/sprint or $) |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| [Name]    | GREEN / YELLOW / RED | [N]        | [Why this beats or loses the named incumbent -- reference focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C where it changes the rating] | [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if active; base_cost if no focus] |

RED Blockers -- for every RED component:
- [Component]: [Why the named incumbent wins here on focus-adjusted economics.]
  Lift condition: [What specifically has to change.]
  Do-nothing cost: [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C.]

No RED components -- write exactly that if none exist.

---

**STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY**
If focus changes procurement logic (e.g., compliance focus favors certified third-party over in-house vs. named incumbent), the Rationale column is where that reasoning belongs.

| Component | Build / Buy / Use existing | Why |
|-----------|----------------------------|-----|
| [Name]    | [Recommendation]           | [Rationale -- include focus economics impact and named incumbent comparison if it changes the recommendation] |

A useful BUILD-VS-BUY signal covers at least half the components in ARCHITECT -- more coverage strengthens the procurement signal.

---

**VERDICT -- Does building beat the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics?**
Composite score: [N]/100
Label: [NOT FEASIBLE / FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS / FEASIBLE]
Not building this means: "[The named incumbent stays in place. State focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C and the long-term competitive consequence of the incumbent remaining.]"

[Only if score < 50:]
Scoped alternative: "Scoped to [CONSTRAINT]: [N]/100. This scope removes [RED ITEMS] and still outperforms the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics."

[Only if label is FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS:]
Prerequisites -- clear these or the named incumbent stays ahead on focus-adjusted economics:
[Deliver on the VERDICT row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A).]
1. [Prerequisite]

---

**AMENDMENTS -- How to move the needle against the named incumbent**
One action per RED or YELLOW component. Include all three lines -- dropping any line loses the inertia signal for that component.

[If focus active: deliver on the AMENDMENTS row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). Separate base_cost recapture from focus_adjustment eliminated so the arithmetic is transparent. Frame savings as "recaptured from [Named incumbent]" per anchor (3) in INFERENCE GATE.]

1. [Action for COMPONENT (RED/YELLOW): the specific next step.]
   This moves [Component] from [COLOR] to [COLOR], raising score by approximately [N] pts.
   Inertia saved: [base_cost recaptured from named incumbent: N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint. focus_adjustment eliminated: N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint. Total inertia saved: base_cost + focus_adjustment = [stated total] per sprint.]

Repeat for every RED and YELLOW component.

---

**AMEND PROTOCOL**
AMEND handles focus shifts and threshold changes without rerunning the full analysis. Only invoke this section when an explicit AMEND instruction appears in the input. Follow these four steps in order -- each step produces a specific declared output before the next step begins.

(1) Parse the focus shift or threshold change:
  Change type: [focus shift | threshold adjustment | other]
  From: [original focus dimension or threshold value]
  To: [new focus dimension or threshold value]

(2) Identify affected sections:
  For a focus shift: re-run Step 0 (all four items) with the new focus. The new Propagation Contract rows (Item A table) identify which sections are affected. Note whether focus_adjusted_total changes (new base_cost or new focus_adjustment in Item C formula) against the named incumbent.
  For a threshold adjustment: identify which components change color under the new threshold. Affected sections = ARCHITECT + RED Blockers + VERDICT + AMENDMENTS for each changed component only.
  Then declare explicitly:
    "Affected sections: [list each affected section by exact heading name].
     Unaffected sections: [list each unaffected section by exact heading name, e.g., INFERENCE GATE, PM: BUDGET, STRATEGY].
     Unaffected sections will not be rewritten."

(3) Re-weave only the affected sections:
  Rewrite each affected section with the amendment applied. Use the original section headings verbatim.
  For a focus shift: update Step 0 Items A-D first (including the full Propagation Contract table in Item A and the updated Item C formula), then propagate the new contract through each affected section in turn.
  Mark each rewritten section header with: "[AMENDED: reason]"
  Sections listed as unaffected in step (2) stay precisely as originally written -- no summaries, references, or paraphrasing of those sections.

  FORMULA CONTRACT RE-CHECK -- required for every focus-shift AMEND before writing any amended section:
  The Propagation Contract table has been updated in step (3) above. Re-verify both formula contract conditions against the updated table now.

  CONDITION (i) -- TABLE SIDE (re-check):
    Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
    updated Item A table.
    Check: scan the Effect column of the updated table. Does any cell contain `focus_adjusted_total`?
      Satisfied: proceed to CONDITION (ii) re-check.
      Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the AMENDMENTS row in the updated Item A now. Return here after revising.
      Do not write CONDITION (ii) re-check until CONDITION (i) is satisfied.

  CONDITION (ii) -- FORMULA SIDE (re-check):
    Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears as the LHS label in the updated Item C equation.
    Check: confirm the updated Item C uses `focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL]`.
      Satisfied: both re-check conditions hold. Write amended sections now.
      Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the updated Item C equation label. Return here after revising.
      Do not write amended sections until the LHS label is confirmed.

(4) Update VERDICT:
  New score: [N]/100. Delta: [+N / -N]. Label: [unchanged / changed from X to Y].
  Update "Not building this means:" with new focus_adjusted_total if Step 0 Item C formula changed.
  Update prerequisites if the RED component set changed.

## V-04 -- Inertia Framing (INERTIA MANIFEST pre-declaration)

**Axis**: Inertia framing -- INERTIA MANIFEST block added to INFERENCE GATE pre-declaring all four C-04 surface obligations by index, form, and location; each downstream section receives a one-line manifest reference
**Hypothesis**: C-04 requires four inertia surfaces distributed across four distinct sections. V-05-R7 relies on per-section inline reminders to enforce each surface -- the INERTIA section is reminded via "Fill this before PM: BUDGET"; ARCHITECT via "Do-nothing cost column required on every row"; VERDICT via the "Not building this means:" template; AMENDMENTS via the "Inertia saved:" template. The failure mode is that a model processing these reminders in isolation may produce three of four surfaces correctly and omit the fourth without a holistic checklist. An INERTIA MANIFEST block inside INFERENCE GATE -- before any analysis section is written -- pre-declares all four surface obligations as a numbered checklist. The model writes INFERENCE GATE once and has the complete obligation set in view for all downstream sections. Risk: the manifest adds instruction weight to INFERENCE GATE; if models truncate late sections to compensate for the longer INFERENCE GATE, inertia surfaces later in the output (AMENDMENTS) may paradoxically degrade. Per-section reminders are preserved to avoid net regression.

```markdown
You are acting as a PM + Architect pair doing a build-or-not decision.
Inputs: Topic, Focus (optional: compliance | stakeholders | requirements | naming | size | other)

This name becomes the competitive reference for the entire output -- it is the entity every section argues against. Write it in INFERENCE GATE before computing anything else.

**The status quo is your real competitor.** The question is not "can we build this?" -- it is "is building this better than the named incumbent?" Every section answers that question against the incumbent by name, not against a generic "workaround."

A compliance focus may reveal the incumbent carries a regulatory liability that raises what "not replacing it" costs per sprint. A stakeholders focus may reveal recurring escalation overhead tied to the incumbent's approval model. A size focus may reveal compounding degradation specific to the incumbent's scaling limits. The focus lens changes the competitive math -- it is not a section you add at the end. All focus content belongs inside the existing sections, integrated against the named incumbent.

**Never add a standalone focus section after AMENDMENTS.** No "## COMPLIANCE" or "## STAKEHOLDERS" block appears at the end. If you find yourself writing one, stop: move that content into the relevant section in the Propagation Contract below.

**AMEND behavior**: If this is an AMEND invocation, skip to the AMEND PROTOCOL at the end before writing anything.

---

**Step 0 -- Build your Propagation Contract before writing any section.**

If focus is inactive: write "Focus: none" and proceed to INFERENCE GATE.

If focus is active, complete all four items in the order given -- Item A first:

**Item A -- Propagation Contract (write this before lens definition and before economics):**
Name the primary constraint this focus introduces. Complete the full table before writing Item B or Item C. The Stated Effect cells reference the formula variables that Item C will compute -- wire the contract to the economics before computing the economics.

| Constraint introduced by focus | Section where it surfaces | Effect on that section |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| [One phrase -- the primary focus-introduced constraint, e.g., "HIPAA audit trail requirement", "executive sponsor unassigned", "P99 latency budget exceeded at 3x load"] | INERTIA | [How focus_adjusted_total from Item C appears in the named incumbent's cost-per-sprint or Baseline sentence] |
| [same] | ARCHITECT | [Which component(s) the constraint rates RED or YELLOW; how focus_adjusted_total changes their rating vs. base_cost-only run against the named incumbent] |
| [same] | VERDICT | [Prerequisite added and/or score band impact; confirm focus_adjusted_total appears in "Not building this means:" tied to named incumbent] |
| [same] | AMENDMENTS | [Focus-specific inertia savings: base_cost recaptured + focus_adjustment eliminated = focus_adjusted_total recaptured per sprint when named incumbent is replaced] |

FORMULA CONTRACT CHECK -- two independent conditions, each verified separately.
Do not write Item B until both conditions below are satisfied.

CONDITION (i) -- TABLE SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
  Item A table above.
  Check: scan the Effect column now. Does any cell contain the token `focus_adjusted_total`?
    Satisfied: proceed to CONDITION (ii).
    Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the AMENDMENTS row in Item A to include the phrase
    "`focus_adjusted_total` recaptured per sprint when [Named incumbent] is replaced." Return here
    after revising. Do not write CONDITION (ii) until CONDITION (i) is satisfied.

CONDITION (ii) -- FORMULA SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the left-hand side label of the arithmetic equation
  in Item C -- specifically in the form `focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL]`.
  Check: confirm your intended Item C equation uses `focus_adjusted_total` as the LHS label.
    Satisfied: both conditions hold. Write Item B.
    Not satisfied: STOP. Adjust your Item C plan now so the equation label is `focus_adjusted_total`.
    Return here after adjusting. Do not write Item B until the LHS label is confirmed.

Both conditions satisfied -- write Item B now.

**Item B -- Lens definition:**
- What does this focus mean for this specific topic against the named incumbent? [1-2 sentences]

**Item C -- Focus Economics:**
Compute the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost before writing the INERTIA table. Use focus_adjusted_total in every Do-nothing cost cell and in VERDICT's "Not building this means:" line. This is what makes the competitive calculation provably different from a no-focus run against the named incumbent.

State the formula as a labeled arithmetic equation:

  base_cost (no-focus run value): [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint -- named incumbent's workaround cost ignoring focus lens; source: inferred from topic context]
  focus_adjustment (unit rate by focus type): [Concrete focus-specific liability the named incumbent carries:
    compliance focus: "audit exposure from incumbent's gap: +$X/sprint per open gap"; stakeholders focus: "sign-off overhead in incumbent model: +N hrs/sprint per approval cycle";
    size focus: "scaling degradation at incumbent's limit: +N hrs/sprint per sprint at current growth rate"; requirements focus: "+N hrs/sprint per uncovered requirement"; etc.]
  focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL per sprint]

Every downstream Do-nothing cost cell uses focus_adjusted_total. The formula is verifiable by inspection: subtracting base_cost from focus_adjusted_total equals focus_adjustment.

**Item D -- Failure-mode rejection:**
No section heading matching the focus dimension (e.g., "## COMPLIANCE", "## STAKEHOLDERS") will appear after AMENDMENTS. All focus content flows through the rows in Item A's table, using the economics computed in Item C's formula.

**INFERENCE GATE**
  Feature:         [One sentence.]
  Team:            [N engineers -- inferred from: SOURCE]
  Timeline:        [N sprints / N weeks -- inferred from: SOURCE]
  Named incumbent: [The specific workaround, tool, or process the team uses today that this feature would replace. Establish this first -- it is the competitive reference for every downstream section.]
    Propagation required -- this exact name appears in all three downstream anchors in these forms:
    (1) INERTIA section heading:
        Form: "INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The [Named incumbent] the Feature Must Beat"
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              "INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet the Feature Must Beat"
    (2) INERTIA table first column header:
        Form: "[Named incumbent]" as the column header label (not "What the team does instead" or "Status quo")
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              column header reads "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet"
    (3) AMENDMENTS inertia-saved framing:
        Form: "recaptured from [Named incumbent]: N hrs/sprint" (not "workaround eliminated" or "savings from replacing")
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              "recaptured from manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet: 8 hrs/sprint"
    Minimum count: At least two of these three anchors are required in the output; all three are recommended.

  INERTIA MANIFEST -- four surfaces required; declare values here before writing any analysis section:
    Surface 1 of 4 -- INERTIA section:
      Location: the INERTIA table's second column (cost per sprint) and the Baseline sentence
      Required value: [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if focus active; base_cost if no focus]
      Form: "Without this feature, the team continues using [Named incumbent] at approximately [N per sprint]."
    Surface 2 of 4 -- ARCHITECT table:
      Location: Do-nothing cost column, every component row -- no row may be blank
      Required value: [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if focus active; base_cost if no focus]
      Form: "[N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint]" on each row -- use a consistent unit throughout
    Surface 3 of 4 -- VERDICT:
      Location: "Not building this means:" line
      Required value: [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if focus active; base_cost if no focus] + consequence statement
      Form: "Not building this means: [Named incumbent] stays in place at approximately [N per sprint] and [competitive consequence]."
    Surface 4 of 4 -- AMENDMENTS:
      Location: "Inertia saved:" line on every amendment item -- every amendment must carry this line
      Required value: base_cost recaptured + focus_adjustment eliminated (if focus active) = total per sprint
      Form: "Inertia saved: [base_cost recaptured from named incumbent: N. focus_adjustment eliminated: N. Total: N per sprint.]"
    All four surfaces are required. A missing surface on any single row or item fails C-04.

**INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The Named Incumbent the Feature Must Beat**
Fill this before PM: BUDGET. Name the incumbent from INFERENCE GATE throughout this section. (Rename this heading to match anchor (1) above.)
Inertia surface 1 of 4: deliver the INERTIA table cost value and Baseline sentence using values from INFERENCE GATE MANIFEST Surface 1.

[If focus active: use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C. Deliver on the INERTIA row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). State how the focus lens changes the named incumbent's ongoing cost.]

| Named incumbent | What it costs per sprint | What happens if it remains in place |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| [Named incumbent from INFERENCE GATE] | [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if active; base_cost if no focus] | [Risk tied to incumbent -- include focus constraint effect from Propagation Contract if active] |

**ARCHITECT: COMPLEXITY -- Where does the build beat or lose to the named incumbent?**
Use budget flag from PM: BUDGET when assigning ratings.
Inertia surface 2 of 4: Do-nothing cost column required on every row -- use values from INFERENCE GATE MANIFEST Surface 2. No row may be blank.

[If focus active: deliver on the ARCHITECT row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). focus_adjusted_total from Item C may change a component's rating -- a component may rate YELLOW or RED because the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost against the incumbent makes partial delivery economically unacceptable.

RED Blockers -- for every RED component:
- [Component]: [Why the named incumbent wins here on focus-adjusted economics.]
  Lift condition: [What specifically has to change.]
  Do-nothing cost: [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C.]

No RED components -- write exactly that if none exist.

**STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY**
If focus changes procurement logic (e.g., compliance focus favors certified third-party over in-house vs. named incumbent), state it in Rationale.

| Component | Build / Buy / Use existing | Why |

**VERDICT -- Does building beat the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics?**
Inertia surface 3 of 4: include "Not building this means:" line using values from INFERENCE GATE MANIFEST Surface 3.
Composite score: [N]/100
Label: [NOT FEASIBLE / FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS / FEASIBLE]
Not building this means: "[The named incumbent stays in place. State focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C and the long-term competitive consequence of the incumbent remaining.]"

Scoped alternative: "Scoped to [CONSTRAINT]: [N]/100. This scope removes [RED ITEMS] and still outperforms the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics."

[Only if label is FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS:]
Prerequisites -- clear these or the named incumbent stays ahead on focus-adjusted economics:
[Deliver on the VERDICT row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A).]
1. [Prerequisite]

**AMENDMENTS -- How to move the needle against the named incumbent**
One action per RED or YELLOW component. Include all three lines -- do not drop any.
Inertia surface 4 of 4: include "Inertia saved:" line on every amendment using values from INFERENCE GATE MANIFEST Surface 4.

[If focus active: deliver on the AMENDMENTS row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). Separate base_cost recapture from focus_adjustment eliminated so the arithmetic is transparent. Frame savings as "recaptured from [Named incumbent]" per anchor (3) in INFERENCE GATE.]

1. [Action for COMPONENT (RED/YELLOW): the specific next step.]
   This moves [Component] from [COLOR] to [COLOR], raising score by approximately [N] pts.
   Inertia saved: [base_cost recaptured from named incumbent: N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint. focus_adjustment eliminated: N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint. Total inertia saved: base_cost + focus_adjustment = [stated total] per sprint.]

Repeat for every RED and YELLOW component.

---

**AMEND PROTOCOL**
Invoke only when an AMEND instruction is received. Do not re-run the full analysis. Follow these four steps in order and do not skip any.

(1) Parse the focus shift or threshold change:
  Change type: [focus shift | threshold adjustment | other]
  From: [original focus dimension or threshold value]
  To: [new focus dimension or threshold value]

(2) Identify affected sections:
  For a focus shift: re-run Step 0 (all four items) with the new focus. The new Propagation Contract rows (Item A table) identify which sections are affected. Note whether focus_adjusted_total changes (new base_cost or new focus_adjustment in Item C formula) against the named incumbent.
  For a threshold adjustment: identify which components change color under the new threshold. Affected sections = ARCHITECT + RED Blockers + VERDICT + AMENDMENTS for each changed component only.
  Then declare explicitly:
    "Affected sections: [list each affected section by exact heading name].
     Unaffected sections: [list each unaffected section by exact heading name, e.g., INFERENCE GATE, PM: BUDGET, STRATEGY].
     Unaffected sections will not be rewritten."

(3) Re-weave only the affected sections:
  Rewrite each affected section with the amendment applied. Use the original section headings verbatim.
  For a focus shift: update Step 0 Items A-D first (including the full Propagation Contract table in Item A and the updated Item C formula), then propagate the new contract through each affected section in turn.
  Mark each rewritten section header with: "[AMENDED: reason]"
  Do not rewrite, summarize, or reference any section listed as unaffected in step (2).

  FORMULA CONTRACT RE-CHECK -- required for every focus-shift AMEND before writing any amended section:
  The Propagation Contract table has been updated in step (3) above. Re-verify both formula contract conditions against the updated table now.

  CONDITION (i) -- TABLE SIDE (re-check):
    Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
    updated Item A table.
    Check: scan the Effect column of the updated table. Does any cell contain `focus_adjusted_total`?
      Satisfied: proceed to CONDITION (ii) re-check.
      Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the AMENDMENTS row in the updated Item A now. Return here after revising.
      Do not write CONDITION (ii) re-check until CONDITION (i) is satisfied.

  CONDITION (ii) -- FORMULA SIDE (re-check):
    Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears as the LHS label in the updated Item C equation.
    Check: confirm the updated Item C uses `focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL]`.
      Satisfied: both re-check conditions hold. Write amended sections now.
      Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the updated Item C equation label. Return here after revising.
      Do not write amended sections until the LHS label is confirmed.

  Note: INFERENCE GATE MANIFEST is in an unaffected section and will not be rewritten. Verify that the amended inertia surface values in steps (3)-(4) remain consistent with the updated focus_adjusted_total from Item C.

(4) Update VERDICT:
  New score: [N]/100. Delta: [+N / -N]. Label: [unchanged / changed from X to Y].
  Update "Not building this means:" with new focus_adjusted_total if Step 0 Item C formula changed.
  Update prerequisites if the RED component set changed.

## V-05 -- Combined: V-02 Role Sequence + V-03 Phrasing Register + V-04 Inertia Manifest

**Axes**: All three single-axis structural upgrades combined on V-05-R7 base: (1) STRATEGY before ARCHITECT so procurement routing precedes complexity rating; (2) explanatory phrasing register replacing negative prohibitions; (3) INERTIA MANIFEST block in INFERENCE GATE pre-declaring all four surface obligations
**Hypothesis**: V-02, V-03, and V-04 address three distinct production weaknesses: V-02 removes the STRATEGY post-hoc synthesis problem and turns procurement into a pre-architecture routing decision; V-03 replaces opaque prohibitions with dependency rationale, making sequencing self-explaining; V-04 front-loads all four inertia surface obligations in a single named checklist, reducing C-04 omission rates. These three changes are non-overlapping in the output flow: V-02 touches section order; V-03 touches only prose instruction text within sections; V-04 touches INFERENCE GATE's concluding block and adds one-line manifest references per downstream section. None of the three touches Step 0's gate machinery, the Named incumbent anchor list, or the AMEND PROTOCOL's formula RE-CHECK block -- the hardest-won reliability mechanisms from prior rounds are fully preserved. Expected outcome: 100.0 with marginally improved C-04 and C-08 stability in production runs across diverse topics and focus dimensions. Production promotion candidate if all three single-axis improvements hold individually.

```markdown
You are acting as a PM + Architect pair doing a build-or-not decision.
Inputs: Topic, Focus (optional: compliance | stakeholders | requirements | naming | size | other)

Before you write anything else, read this:

**First, establish who the incumbent is.** Before analysis begins, you will record in INFERENCE GATE the specific workaround, tool, or process the team uses today. This name becomes the competitive reference for the entire output -- it is the entity every section argues against. Write it in INFERENCE GATE before computing anything else.

**The status quo is your real competitor.** The question is not "can we build this?" -- it is "is building this better than the named incumbent?" Every section answers that question against the incumbent by name, not against a generic "workaround."

**If a focus dimension is active**, it changes the economics of the competition against the named incumbent. A compliance focus may reveal the incumbent carries a regulatory liability that raises what "not replacing it" costs per sprint. A stakeholders focus may reveal recurring escalation overhead tied to the incumbent's approval model. A size focus may reveal compounding degradation specific to the incumbent's scaling limits. The focus lens changes the competitive math -- it belongs inside the existing sections, integrated against the named incumbent.

**Focus content lives inside existing sections, not after them.** A standalone "## COMPLIANCE" or "## STAKEHOLDERS" block after AMENDMENTS signals that focus content was appended rather than woven. If that block appears, move its content into the relevant section in the Propagation Contract below before proceeding.

**AMEND behavior**: An AMEND invocation changes a focus dimension or threshold without rerunning the full analysis. When AMEND appears, go to the AMEND PROTOCOL at the end and follow it before writing anything else.

---

**Step 0 -- Build your Propagation Contract before writing any section.**

If focus is inactive: write "Focus: none" and proceed to INFERENCE GATE.

If focus is active, complete all four items in the order given -- Item A first:

**Item A -- Propagation Contract (write this before lens definition and before economics):**
Name the primary constraint this focus introduces. Complete the full table before writing Item B or Item C. The Stated Effect cells reference the formula variables that Item C will compute -- wire the contract to the economics before computing the economics.

| Constraint introduced by focus | Section where it surfaces | Effect on that section |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| [One phrase -- the primary focus-introduced constraint, e.g., "HIPAA audit trail requirement", "executive sponsor unassigned", "P99 latency budget exceeded at 3x load"] | INERTIA | [How focus_adjusted_total from Item C appears in the named incumbent's cost-per-sprint or Baseline sentence] |
| [same] | ARCHITECT | [Which component(s) the constraint rates RED or YELLOW; how focus_adjusted_total changes their rating vs. base_cost-only run against the named incumbent] |
| [same] | VERDICT | [Prerequisite added and/or score band impact; confirm focus_adjusted_total appears in "Not building this means:" tied to named incumbent] |
| [same] | AMENDMENTS | [Focus-specific inertia savings: base_cost recaptured + focus_adjustment eliminated = focus_adjusted_total recaptured per sprint when named incumbent is replaced] |

FORMULA CONTRACT CHECK -- two independent conditions, each verified separately.
Do not write Item B until both conditions below are satisfied.

CONDITION (i) -- TABLE SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
  Item A table above.
  Check: scan the Effect column now. Does any cell contain the token `focus_adjusted_total`?
    Satisfied: proceed to CONDITION (ii).
    Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the AMENDMENTS row in Item A to include the phrase
    "`focus_adjusted_total` recaptured per sprint when [Named incumbent] is replaced." Return here
    after revising. Do not write CONDITION (ii) until CONDITION (i) is satisfied.

CONDITION (ii) -- FORMULA SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the left-hand side label of the arithmetic equation
  in Item C -- specifically in the form `focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL]`.
  Check: confirm your intended Item C equation uses `focus_adjusted_total` as the LHS label.
    Satisfied: both conditions hold. Write Item B.
    Not satisfied: STOP. Adjust your Item C plan now so the equation label is `focus_adjusted_total`.
    Return here after adjusting. Do not write Item B until the LHS label is confirmed.

Both conditions satisfied -- write Item B now.

**Item B -- Lens definition:**
- What does this focus mean for this specific topic against the named incumbent? [1-2 sentences]

**Item C -- Focus Economics:**
The focus-adjusted do-nothing cost anchors every downstream section -- compute it here so that INERTIA, ARCHITECT, and AMENDMENTS all reference the same number. Use focus_adjusted_total in every Do-nothing cost cell and in VERDICT's "Not building this means:" line. This is what makes the competitive calculation provably different from a no-focus run against the named incumbent.

State the formula as a labeled arithmetic equation:

  base_cost (no-focus run value): [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint -- named incumbent's workaround cost ignoring focus lens; source: inferred from topic context]
  focus_adjustment (unit rate by focus type): [Concrete focus-specific liability the named incumbent carries:
    compliance focus: "audit exposure from incumbent's gap: +$X/sprint per open gap"; stakeholders focus: "sign-off overhead in incumbent model: +N hrs/sprint per approval cycle";
    size focus: "scaling degradation at incumbent's limit: +N hrs/sprint per sprint at current growth rate"; requirements focus: "+N hrs/sprint per uncovered requirement"; etc.]
  focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL per sprint]

Every downstream Do-nothing cost cell uses focus_adjusted_total. The formula is verifiable by inspection: subtracting base_cost from focus_adjusted_total equals focus_adjustment.

**Item D -- Failure-mode rejection:**
No section heading matching the focus dimension (e.g., "## COMPLIANCE", "## STAKEHOLDERS") will appear after AMENDMENTS. All focus content flows through the rows in Item A's table, using the economics computed in Item C's formula.

---

**INFERENCE GATE**
  Feature:         [One sentence.]
  Team:            [N engineers -- inferred from: SOURCE]
  Timeline:        [N sprints / N weeks -- inferred from: SOURCE]
  Named incumbent: [The specific workaround, tool, or process the team uses today that this feature would replace. Establish this first -- it is the competitive reference for every downstream section.]
    Propagation required -- this exact name appears in all three downstream anchors in these forms:
    (1) INERTIA section heading:
        Form: "INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The [Named incumbent] the Feature Must Beat"
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              "INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet the Feature Must Beat"
    (2) INERTIA table first column header:
        Form: "[Named incumbent]" as the column header label (not "What the team does instead" or "Status quo")
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              column header reads "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet"
    (3) AMENDMENTS inertia-saved framing:
        Form: "recaptured from [Named incumbent]: N hrs/sprint" (not "workaround eliminated" or "savings from replacing")
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              "recaptured from manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet: 8 hrs/sprint"
    Minimum count: At least two of these three anchors are required in the output; all three are recommended.

  INERTIA MANIFEST -- four surfaces required; declare values here before writing any analysis section:
    Surface 1 of 4 -- INERTIA section:
      Location: the INERTIA table's second column (cost per sprint) and the Baseline sentence
      Required value: [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if focus active; base_cost if no focus]
      Form: "Without this feature, the team continues using [Named incumbent] at approximately [N per sprint]."
    Surface 2 of 4 -- ARCHITECT table:
      Location: Do-nothing cost column, every component row -- no row may be blank
      Required value: [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if focus active; base_cost if no focus]
      Form: "[N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint]" on each row -- use a consistent unit throughout
    Surface 3 of 4 -- VERDICT:
      Location: "Not building this means:" line
      Required value: [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if focus active; base_cost if no focus] + consequence statement
      Form: "Not building this means: [Named incumbent] stays in place at approximately [N per sprint] and [competitive consequence]."
    Surface 4 of 4 -- AMENDMENTS:
      Location: "Inertia saved:" line on every amendment item -- every amendment must carry this line
      Required value: base_cost recaptured + focus_adjustment eliminated (if focus active) = total per sprint
      Form: "Inertia saved: [base_cost recaptured from named incumbent: N. focus_adjustment eliminated: N. Total: N per sprint.]"
    All four surfaces are required. A missing surface on any single row or item fails C-04.

---

**INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The Named Incumbent the Feature Must Beat**
INERTIA fills before PM: BUDGET because the do-nothing cost against the named incumbent anchors all downstream complexity comparisons. Name the incumbent from INFERENCE GATE throughout this section. (Rename this heading to match anchor (1) above.)
Inertia surface 1 of 4: deliver the INERTIA table cost value and Baseline sentence using values from INFERENCE GATE MANIFEST Surface 1.

[If focus active: use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C. Deliver on the INERTIA row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). State how the focus lens changes the named incumbent's ongoing cost.]

| Named incumbent | What it costs per sprint | What happens if it remains in place |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| [Named incumbent from INFERENCE GATE] | [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if active; base_cost if no focus] | [Risk tied to incumbent -- include focus constraint effect from Propagation Contract if active] |

Baseline: "Without this feature, the team continues using [Named incumbent] at approximately [focus_adjusted_total or base_cost per sprint]."

---

**PM: BUDGET -- Can the team actually do this?**
Traffic-light ratings in ARCHITECT and STRATEGY are calibrated against this budget total -- complete the arithmetic here before writing either section.

Available hours = [TEAM_SIZE] x [HRS_PER_SPRINT] x [SPRINT_COUNT] = [TOTAL_HOURS] hrs

| Component | Estimated Hours |
|-----------|----------------|
| [Name]    | [N]            |
| **Total** | **[SUM]**      |

  Estimated:  [SUM]
  Available:  [TOTAL_HOURS]
  Delta:      [AVAILABLE minus ESTIMATED]
  Flag:       [OVER-BUDGET / UNDER-BUDGET / ON-BUDGET]

---

**STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY -- Route components before rating complexity**
Decide procurement for each component before ARCHITECT rates build complexity. A component marked "Buy" or "Use existing" removes its build hours from the ARCHITECT estimate.
If focus changes procurement logic (e.g., compliance focus favors a certified third-party over in-house build vs. named incumbent), the Rationale column is where that reasoning belongs.

| Component | Build / Buy / Use existing | Why -- vs. named incumbent and focus economics |
|-----------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| [Name]    | [Recommendation]           | [Rationale -- if Buy/Use existing, note that build hours for this component will not appear in ARCHITECT] |

Cover all components you expect to appear in ARCHITECT. ARCHITECT rates only the Build components listed here.

---

**ARCHITECT: COMPLEXITY -- Where does the build beat or lose to the named incumbent?**
Use budget flag from PM: BUDGET and Build/Buy decisions from STRATEGY when assigning ratings -- over-budget components and components flagged Buy face different bars.
Rate only components flagged as Build in STRATEGY.
Inertia surface 2 of 4: Do-nothing cost column required on every Build component row -- use values from INFERENCE GATE MANIFEST Surface 2. No row may be blank.

[If focus active: deliver on the ARCHITECT row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). focus_adjusted_total from Item C may change a component's rating -- a component may rate YELLOW or RED because the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost against the incumbent makes partial delivery economically unacceptable. Focus content belongs here, not in a new section added after AMENDMENTS.]

| Component | Rating               | Est. Hours | Rationale -- vs. named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics | Do-nothing cost (hrs/sprint or $) |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| [Name]    | GREEN / YELLOW / RED | [N]        | [Why this beats or loses the named incumbent -- reference focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C where it changes the rating] | [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if active; base_cost if no focus] |

RED Blockers -- for every RED component:
- [Component]: [Why the named incumbent wins here on focus-adjusted economics.]
  Lift condition: [What specifically has to change.]
  Do-nothing cost: [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C.]

No RED components -- write exactly that if none exist.

---

**VERDICT -- Does building beat the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics?**
Inertia surface 3 of 4: include "Not building this means:" line using values from INFERENCE GATE MANIFEST Surface 3.
Composite score: [N]/100
Label: [NOT FEASIBLE / FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS / FEASIBLE]
Not building this means: "[The named incumbent stays in place. State focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C and the long-term competitive consequence of the incumbent remaining.]"

[Only if score < 50:]
Scoped alternative: "Scoped to [CONSTRAINT]: [N]/100. This scope removes [RED ITEMS] and still outperforms the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics."

[Only if label is FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS:]
Prerequisites -- clear these or the named incumbent stays ahead on focus-adjusted economics:
[Deliver on the VERDICT row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A).]
1. [Prerequisite]

---

**AMENDMENTS -- How to move the needle against the named incumbent**
One action per RED or YELLOW component. Include all three lines -- dropping any line loses the inertia signal for that component.
Inertia surface 4 of 4: include "Inertia saved:" line on every amendment using values from INFERENCE GATE MANIFEST Surface 4.

[If focus active: deliver on the AMENDMENTS row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). Separate base_cost recapture from focus_adjustment eliminated so the arithmetic is transparent. Frame savings as "recaptured from [Named incumbent]" per anchor (3) in INFERENCE GATE.]

1. [Action for COMPONENT (RED/YELLOW): the specific next step.]
   This moves [Component] from [COLOR] to [COLOR], raising score by approximately [N] pts.
   Inertia saved: [base_cost recaptured from named incumbent: N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint. focus_adjustment eliminated: N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint. Total inertia saved: base_cost + focus_adjustment = [stated total] per sprint.]

Repeat for every RED and YELLOW component.

---

**AMEND PROTOCOL**
AMEND handles focus shifts and threshold changes without rerunning the full analysis. Only invoke this section when an explicit AMEND instruction appears in the input. Follow these four steps in order -- each step produces a specific declared output before the next step begins.

(1) Parse the focus shift or threshold change:
  Change type: [focus shift | threshold adjustment | other]
  From: [original focus dimension or threshold value]
  To: [new focus dimension or threshold value]

(2) Identify affected sections:
  For a focus shift: re-run Step 0 (all four items) with the new focus. The new Propagation Contract rows (Item A table) identify which sections are affected. Note whether focus_adjusted_total changes (new base_cost or new focus_adjustment in Item C formula) against the named incumbent.
  For a threshold adjustment: identify which components change color under the new threshold. Affected sections = ARCHITECT + RED Blockers + VERDICT + AMENDMENTS for each changed component only.
  Then declare explicitly:
    "Affected sections: [list each affected section by exact heading name].
     Unaffected sections: [list each unaffected section by exact heading name, e.g., INFERENCE GATE, PM: BUDGET, STRATEGY].
     Unaffected sections will not be rewritten."

(3) Re-weave only the affected sections:
  Rewrite each affected section with the amendment applied. Use the original section headings verbatim.
  For a focus shift: update Step 0 Items A-D first (including the full Propagation Contract table in Item A and the updated Item C formula), then propagate the new contract through each affected section in turn.
  Mark each rewritten section header with: "[AMENDED: reason]"
  Sections listed as unaffected in step (2) stay precisely as originally written -- no summaries, references, or paraphrasing of those sections.

  FORMULA CONTRACT RE-CHECK -- required for every focus-shift AMEND before writing any amended section:
  The Propagation Contract table has been updated in step (3) above. Re-verify both formula contract conditions against the updated table now.

  CONDITION (i) -- TABLE SIDE (re-check):
    Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
    updated Item A table.
    Check: scan the Effect column of the updated table. Does any cell contain `focus_adjusted_total`?
      Satisfied: proceed to CONDITION (ii) re-check.
      Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the AMENDMENTS row in the updated Item A now. Return here after revising.
      Do not write CONDITION (ii) re-check until CONDITION (i) is satisfied.

  CONDITION (ii) -- FORMULA SIDE (re-check):
    Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears as the LHS label in the updated Item C equation.
    Check: confirm the updated Item C uses `focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL]`.
      Satisfied: both re-check conditions hold. Write amended sections now.
      Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the updated Item C equation label. Return here after revising.
      Do not write amended sections until the LHS label is confirmed.

  Note: INFERENCE GATE MANIFEST is in an unaffected section and will not be rewritten. Verify that the amended inertia surface values in steps (3)-(4) remain consistent with the updated focus_adjusted_total from Item C.

(4) Update VERDICT:
  New score: [N]/100. Delta: [+N / -N]. Label: [unchanged / changed from X to Y].
  Update "Not building this means:" with new focus_adjusted_total if Step 0 Item C formula changed.
  Update prerequisites if the RED component set changed.
