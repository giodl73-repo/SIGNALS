## R12 Variations Summary

| Var | C-37 | C-38 | Est. Asp. | Est. Composite |
|-----|------|------|-----------|----------------|
| V-01 | **FAIL** | PASS | 29/30 | 99.67 |
| V-02 | PASS | **FAIL** | 29/30 | 99.67 |
| V-03 | PASS | **FAIL** (boundary) | 29/30 | 99.67 |
| V-04 | **FAIL** | **FAIL** | 28/30 | 99.33 |
| V-05 | PASS | PASS | 30/30 | 100.00 |

**What each variation tests:**

**V-01** (C-37 isolated): Adds per-rule reader-position to all three rules (C-38 passes) but keeps inline labels in the ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE. C-35 is satisfied -- the headings are the single source of truth -- but the note still re-asserts the labels inline rather than pointing to them. C-37 fails; C-38 passes. Confirms the two are independently testable: note-level structural choice vs. body-level reader framing are separate locations.

**V-02** (C-38 isolated): Collapses the note to forward-refs (C-37 passes) but only Rule 3 has reader-position framing. Rules 1 and 2 state the rule without naming a consulting reader. C-36 is satisfied (Rule 3 alone); C-38 is not (universal quantifier requires every rule). Confirms C-38 is not discharged by C-36 alone.

**V-03** (C-38 boundary): Note forward-refs present (C-37 passes); Rule 1 and Rule 3 carry named reader-positions; Rule 2 has no reader framing. C-38 fails -- two out of three does not discharge the universal quantifier. Tests that C-38 genuinely means *every* rule, not just most.

**V-04** (combined regression): R11 V-05 verbatim. Inline note labels (C-37 fail) + only Rule 3 has reader-position (C-38 fail). Confirms the two criteria contribute exactly one point each and are independently isolable.

**V-05** (full ceiling): Forward-ref note + per-rule reader-position on all three rules. 30/30.

**Key structural changes from R11 V-05 baseline:**
- C-37: `Rule 1 (absence declaration)` -> `Rule 1 -- failure class: see Rule 1 heading above`
- C-38: Rules 1 and 2 each gain a named consulting-reader statement keyed to their failure mode, before the Applies-to line
d: `Rule 1 (absence declaration) -- prevents silent omissions:`
- New: `Rule 1 -- failure class: see Rule 1 heading above -- prevents silent omissions:`

For C-38 (PASS): Rules 1 and 2 each gain a named reader-position consulting statement
(before their Applies-to line):
- Rule 1 addition: "A committing engineer checking for missing absence declarations
  consults this rule to determine which Finding locations require verbatim phrases when
  no evidence exists. Silence in any governed location constitutes absence drift."
- Rule 2 addition: "A skill-reference consumer disambiguating a reference consults this
  rule to determine whether a skill name in the output can be resolved to a runnable
  skill. A bare name or imprecise format in any governed location constitutes reference
  ambiguity -- it cannot be resolved without guessing."

**Potential R13 signals flagged in V-05:** (1) ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE after C-37 still
contains inline failure descriptions ("prevents silent omissions", "prevents reference
ambiguity", "prevents constraint scope gaps") -- these descriptions are now the note's
only inline content besides the interdependency declaration; candidate for whether the
descriptions should also migrate to rule body text, making the note a pure
interdependency statement with all substantive content in rule bodies; (2) per-rule
reader-position consulting statements in Rules 1 and 2 are structurally unlabeled
(appended as prose before Applies-to); candidate for whether they should be structurally
labeled (e.g., "Consulting reader:") parallel to Rule 3's "Obligation:" / "Existence
condition:" labeled sections.

---

## V-01: C-37 FAIL -- Inline note labels retained; per-rule reader-position present

**Variation axis**: Per-rule reader-position (C-38) without forward-reference dedup in note
**Hypothesis**: A STANDING RULES block where all three rule headings encode their failure
class (C-35 satisfied: "Rule 1 -- Absence Drift -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:", etc.),
each rule carries its own named reader-position consulting statement (C-38 passes),
BUT the ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE still uses inline failure-class labels ("Rule 1 (absence
declaration)", "Rule 2 (skill format)", "Rule 3 (location enumeration)") rather than
forward-reference pointers -- fails C-37 only. The heading is the single source of truth
for failure-class information (C-35 satisfied) but the note re-asserts the labels
inline rather than pointing back to the heading. A reviewer consulting the note still
encounters the label there rather than being directed to the canonical heading location.
Scores 29/30. Confirms C-37 (note-level structural choice) is independently testable
from C-38 (per-rule body-level reader framing): passing C-38 does not automatically
satisfy C-37.

```
You are running /signal:check for topic: {topic}.

Think of this as a preflight check. The checklist does not decide whether to fly --
it makes sure the pilot sees everything before they decide. Nothing here blocks you
from proceeding. It exists so you know what you know before you commit.

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

  Rule 1 -- Absence Drift -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the
    absence explicitly using the required verbatim phrases specified at each dimension.
    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    A committing engineer checking for missing absence declarations consults this
    rule to determine which Finding locations require verbatim phrases when no
    evidence exists. Silence in any governed location constitutes absence drift.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    A skill-reference consumer disambiguating a reference consults this rule to
    determine whether a skill name in the output can be resolved to a runnable skill.
    A bare name or imprecise format in any governed location constitutes reference
    ambiguity -- it cannot be resolved without guessing.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps -- RULES WITHOUT DECLARED SCOPE DO NOT EXIST:
    Obligation: every Rule in this STANDING RULES block must declare all output
    locations it governs. Scope must be discharged at rule-creation time, not
    retroactively.
    Existence condition: a Rule that has not declared its scope does not exist as an
    active rule. "Not operative" understates the condition -- an inoperative rule
    is still a declared object with suspended force. A rule without scope has no
    force, no scope, and no standing. It does not exist as an active rule.
    These two registers are not substitutes: the obligation tells a committing
    engineer reading for what to fix; the existence condition tells a reviewer
    reading for what is already lost.
    This requirement self-applies: Rule 3 itself declares its scope below.
    A constraint without explicit location scope cannot be verified by section-level
    inspection.
    Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block, including Rule 3
    itself and any rule added in the future.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each addresses an
  independent failure mode:
    Rule 1 (absence declaration) -- prevents silent omissions: outputs that appear
      complete but contain no evidence for missing dimensions.
    Rule 2 (skill format) -- prevents reference ambiguity: bare names or imprecise
      references block automated and human consumers from resolving skills.
    Rule 3 (location enumeration) -- prevents constraint scope gaps: a rule without
      explicit location scope cannot be verified without a full-output scan.
  No rule substitutes for another. Satisfying two of three does not constitute a
  passing output. All three must pass for the output to be a valid health report.

=== GATHER YOUR SIGNALS ===

Use Glob: simulations/**/*{topic}*.md

Build the inventory:

  | # | Artifact path | Namespace | Signal type | Date |
  |---|--------------|-----------|-------------|------|

Artifact count: {N}

If no artifacts found: "No signal artifacts exist yet for {topic}. Consider running
/discover:causal, /discover:competitors, or /scout:feasibility before committing." Stop.

=== READINESS SUMMARY ===

[Write this section last -- place it first in the final artifact.]

2-4 sentences: overall signal health for {topic}, which dimensions are clear, which
have gaps worth addressing. If recommending an action, name the skill using
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2). Frame as pilot briefing -- not a verdict. The team
decides.

Rule 1 applies: if no signal artifacts exist, write "No signal artifacts found --
health assessment cannot be made." Do not imply signal health when none was checked.

=== THE PREFLIGHT CHECK ===

Each item uses this structure:

  STATUS: OK | FLAG | OPEN
    OK = no issue
    FLAG = issue found, worth reviewing before committing
    OPEN = gap -- no artifact covers this area
  Basis: [name the specific artifacts examined -- with dates; "see above" does not pass;
    if no artifacts cover the area, write "no artifact covers [question]"]
  Finding: [specific named observation; OR required verbatim absence phrase -- Rule 1
    applies: use the exact required phrase, do not leave blank, do not hedge]
  Action: [required if STATUS is FLAG or OPEN; must use /namespace:skill format --
    Rule 2; omit only when STATUS is OK]

Work through all four items. Order is intentional: start with the causal question.

--- Item 1: CAUSAL GAP ---

What we're checking:
  Do you have evidence for why the feature causes the claimed outcome -- not just
  that it might, but how? This is the signal teams gather last, if ever. A full
  discovery stack can exist while the mechanism remains uninvestigated.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no mechanism evidence is found, write this exactly:
    "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal gap is open."
  Do not substitute, hedge, or leave the Finding blank. This exact wording is required.

What we found:

  Step 1: Name the claimed outcome for {topic}:
    "The claimed outcome is: [outcome]."
    If not stated in any artifact: "The claimed outcome is not named in any artifact --
    this is itself a gap."

  Step 2: Define mechanism evidence -- a causal chain of observable intermediate steps
  from feature to outcome. Not:
    - A correlation ("users who use X have better Y scores")
    - An outcome claim ("users will benefit")
    - A proxy metric ("adoption rate will increase")
  Is: "Feature causes outcome because [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."

  Step 3: Scan every artifact. State one of:
    (a) "Mechanism evidence found: [artifact, date] establishes [mechanism] by tracing
        [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."
    (b) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal
        gap is open."
  Rule 1: form (b) is required when no mechanism evidence exists. Do not leave blank.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifacts checked for mechanism content; if none: "no artifact addresses
    mechanism -- inventory checked: {artifact names}"]
  Finding: [(a) or required absence phrase (b) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: "Run /discover:causal to establish mechanism evidence
    before committing." Rule 2: /discover:causal, not "discover-causal".]

--- Item 2: SEQUENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Did discovery happen before specification? Commitment tends to close off
  investigation. Specs written before discovery signals existed may reflect direction
  chosen before the team knew what they were committing to.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no discovery artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering cannot be established."
  Do not write SEQUENCE OK when no discovery artifacts were checked.

What we found:
  Classify each artifact as discovery (discover, scout, prove, research, listen) or
  commitment (draft, topic, program). Note the date of each.

  Compare dates. State one of:
    (a) "Discovery precedes commitment: [discovery artifact, date] predates [commitment
        artifact, date]."
    (b) "Commitment precedes discovery: [commitment artifact, date] predates [discovery
        artifact, date]. Inversion flagged."
    (c) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering
        cannot be established."
  Rule 1: form (c) is required when no discovery artifacts exist.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifact names and dates compared; if no discovery artifacts: "no discovery
    artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [(a), (b), or required absence phrase (c) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the missing discovery signal and skill using
    /namespace:skill format -- Rule 2]

--- Item 3: STALENESS ---

What we're checking:
  Are your signals fresh enough to act on? Domain velocity determines freshness.
  Fast-moving market: a 30-day-old competitive signal may be unreliable. Stable
  enterprise cycle: a 90-day-old signal may hold. This checks whether artifact
  dates fall within a defensible window for the decisions being made.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no dated artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."
  Do not apply a threshold to an empty inventory without noting the absence.

What we found:
  First, name the threshold:
    "For {topic}'s domain: signals older than [N] days are stale because [reason]."

  Apply to each artifact. State which are within threshold and which are past it.
  Rule 1: if no dated artifacts, write the required absence phrase above.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [each artifact with date; or "no dated artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [fresh/stale breakdown by name; OR required absence phrase:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the stale artifact, its age vs. threshold, and the
    skill to refresh it -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

--- Item 4: COHERENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Do your signals tell a consistent story? When two signals address the same question,
  they should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be visible and deliberate.
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What we found:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

This matters because addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with one action.
Look especially for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase -- one root,
    two symptoms. Action: /discover:causal addresses both.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: spec preceded discovery; mechanism gap is
    downstream of the same premature commitment.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: stale signal is source of contradiction.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."

=== ARTIFACT ===

Write to simulations/signal/check/{topic}-check-{date}.md.

Frontmatter:
  topic: {topic}
  date: {date}
  causal_gap_status: ok | flag | open
  sequence_status: ok | flag | open
  staleness_status: ok | flag | open
  coherence_status: ok | flag | open
  staleness_threshold_named: true | false
  mechanism_evidence_found: true | false
  explicit_absences_declared: true | false
  skill_format_enforced: true
  cross_dimension_pattern: true | false
  missing_signals_by_skill: true | false
  verbatim_absence_phrases_used: true | false
  artifact_count: {count}
  open_dimensions: [{list of FLAG or OPEN dimension names}]
```

## V-02: C-38 FAIL -- Note forward-refs present; per-rule reader-position absent for Rules 1 and 2

**Variation axis**: Forward-reference dedup (C-37) without per-rule reader-position
**Hypothesis**: A STANDING RULES block whose ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE collapses inline
failure-class labels to forward-references ("Rule 1 -- failure class: see Rule 1
heading above") satisfies C-37. Rule 3 retains the C-36 non-substitutability reader-
position framing ("the obligation tells a committing engineer reading for what to fix;
the existence condition tells a reviewer reading for what is already lost"). Rules 1
and 2 carry no explicit reader-position statement -- their bodies state the rule without
naming the consulting reader. C-38 fails: the universal quantifier requires every rule
in the STANDING RULES block to name its own reader position, and Rules 1 and 2 do not.
C-36 passes (Rule 3 satisfies it); C-38 requires the further extension to Rules 1 and
2, which is absent. Scores 29/30. Confirms C-38 is not discharged by C-36 alone: an
output satisfying C-36 for Rule 3 only, with Rules 1 and 2 using no reader-position
framing, satisfies C-36 but not C-38.

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

  Rule 1 -- Absence Drift -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the
    absence explicitly using the required verbatim phrases specified at each dimension.
    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps -- RULES WITHOUT DECLARED SCOPE DO NOT EXIST:
    Obligation: every Rule in this STANDING RULES block must declare all output
    locations it governs. Scope must be discharged at rule-creation time, not
    retroactively.
    Existence condition: a Rule that has not declared its scope does not exist as an
    active rule. "Not operative" understates the condition -- an inoperative rule

    inspection.
    Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block, including Rule 3
    itself and any rule added in the future.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each addresses an
  independent failure mode -- failure class encoded in each rule's heading above:
    Rule 1 -- failure class: see Rule 1 heading above -- prevents silent omissions:
      outputs that appear complete but contain no evidence for missing dimensions.
    Rule 2 -- failure class: see Rule 2 heading above -- prevents reference ambiguity:
      bare names or imprecise references block automated and human consumers from
      resolving skills.
    Rule 3 -- failure class: see Rule 3 heading above -- prevents constraint scope gaps:
      a rule without explicit location scope cannot be verified without a full-output scan.
  No rule substitutes for another. Satisfying two of three does not constitute a

--- Item 4: COHERENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Do your signals tell a consistent story? When two signals address the same question,
  they should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be visible and deliberate.
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What we found:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

This matters because addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with one action.
Look especially for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase -- one root,
    two symptoms. Action: /discover:causal addresses both.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: spec preceded discovery; mechanism gap is
    downstream of the same premature commitment.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: stale signal is source of contradiction.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."

## V-03: C-38 FAIL (boundary) -- Rules 1+3 named; Rule 2 generic; C-37 PASS

**Variation axis**: C-38 universal quantifier -- partial per-rule reader-position
**Hypothesis**: A STANDING RULES block where the ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE uses forward-
references (C-37 passes), Rule 1 carries a named reader-position consulting statement
("A committing engineer checking for missing absence declarations consults this rule..."),
Rule 3 carries its C-36 non-substitutability reader-position framing ("the obligation
tells a committing engineer reading for what to fix; the existence condition tells a
reviewer reading for what is already lost"), BUT Rule 2 retains no reader-position
framing -- fails C-38. The C-38 universal quantifier requires every rule in the STANDING
RULES block to name its own reader position keyed to that rule's failure mode. Two out
of three is not sufficient. Rule 2's failure mode (reference ambiguity) has a distinct
consulting reader -- a skill-reference consumer disambiguating a reference -- but that
reader is not named in Rule 2's body. C-36 passes (Rule 3 satisfies it). C-38 fails
(Rule 2 is the unsatisfied case). Scores 29/30. Confirms C-38 tests a genuine universal
quantifier: partial coverage of the STANDING RULES block does not satisfy it.

```
You are running /signal:check for topic: {topic}.

Think of this as a preflight check. The checklist does not decide whether to fly --
it makes sure the pilot sees everything before they decide. Nothing here blocks you
from proceeding. It exists so you know what you know before you commit.

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

  Rule 1 -- Absence Drift -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the
    absence explicitly using the required verbatim phrases specified at each dimension.
    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    A committing engineer checking for missing absence declarations consults this
    rule to determine which Finding locations require verbatim phrases when no
    evidence exists. Silence in any governed location constitutes absence drift.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps -- RULES WITHOUT DECLARED SCOPE DO NOT EXIST:
    Obligation: every Rule in this STANDING RULES block must declare all output
    locations it governs. Scope must be discharged at rule-creation time, not
    retroactively.
    Existence condition: a Rule that has not declared its scope does not exist as an
    active rule. "Not operative" understates the condition -- an inoperative rule
    is still a declared object with suspended force. A rule without scope has no
    force, no scope, and no standing. It does not exist as an active rule.
    These two registers are not substitutes: the obligation tells a committing
    engineer reading for what to fix; the existence condition tells a reviewer
    reading for what is already lost.
    This requirement self-applies: Rule 3 itself declares its scope below.
    A constraint without explicit location scope cannot be verified by section-level
    inspection.
    Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block, including Rule 3
    itself and any rule added in the future.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each addresses an
  independent failure mode -- failure class encoded in each rule's heading above:
    Rule 1 -- failure class: see Rule 1 heading above -- prevents silent omissions:
      outputs that appear complete but contain no evidence for missing dimensions.
    Rule 2 -- failure class: see Rule 2 heading above -- prevents reference ambiguity:
      bare names or imprecise references block automated and human consumers from
      resolving skills.
    Rule 3 -- failure class: see Rule 3 heading above -- prevents constraint scope gaps:
      a rule without explicit location scope cannot be verified without a full-output scan.
  No rule substitutes for another. Satisfying two of three does not constitute a
  passing output. All three must pass for the output to be a valid health report.

=== GATHER YOUR SIGNALS ===

Use Glob: simulations/**/*{topic}*.md

Build the inventory:

  | # | Artifact path | Namespace | Signal type | Date |
  |---|--------------|-----------|-------------|------|

Artifact count: {N}

If no artifacts found: "No signal artifacts exist yet for {topic}. Consider running
/discover:causal, /discover:competitors, or /scout:feasibility before committing." Stop.

=== READINESS SUMMARY ===

[Write this section last -- place it first in the final artifact.]

2-4 sentences: overall signal health for {topic}, which dimensions are clear, which
have gaps worth addressing. If recommending an action, name the skill using
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2). Frame as pilot briefing -- not a verdict. The team
decides.

Rule 1 applies: if no signal artifacts exist, write "No signal artifacts found --
health assessment cannot be made." Do not imply signal health when none was checked.

=== THE PREFLIGHT CHECK ===

Each item uses this structure:

  STATUS: OK | FLAG | OPEN
    OK = no issue
    FLAG = issue found, worth reviewing before committing
    OPEN = gap -- no artifact covers this area
  Basis: [name the specific artifacts examined -- with dates; "see above" does not pass;
    if no artifacts cover the area, write "no artifact covers [question]"]
  Finding: [specific named observation; OR required verbatim absence phrase -- Rule 1
    applies: use the exact required phrase, do not leave blank, do not hedge]
  Action: [required if STATUS is FLAG or OPEN; must use /namespace:skill format --
    Rule 2; omit only when STATUS is OK]

Work through all four items. Order is intentional: start with the causal question.

--- Item 1: CAUSAL GAP ---

What we're checking:
  Do you have evidence for why the feature causes the claimed outcome -- not just
  that it might, but how? This is the signal teams gather last, if ever. A full
  discovery stack can exist while the mechanism remains uninvestigated.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no mechanism evidence is found, write this exactly:
    "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal gap is open."
  Do not substitute, hedge, or leave the Finding blank. This exact wording is required.

What we found:

  Step 1: Name the claimed outcome for {topic}:
    "The claimed outcome is: [outcome]."
    If not stated in any artifact: "The claimed outcome is not named in any artifact --
    this is itself a gap."

  Step 2: Define mechanism evidence -- a causal chain of observable intermediate steps
  from feature to outcome. Not:
    - A correlation ("users who use X have better Y scores")
    - An outcome claim ("users will benefit")
    - A proxy metric ("adoption rate will increase")
  Is: "Feature causes outcome because [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."

  Step 3: Scan every artifact. State one of:
    (a) "Mechanism evidence found: [artifact, date] establishes [mechanism] by tracing
        [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."
    (b) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal
        gap is open."
  Rule 1: form (b) is required when no mechanism evidence exists. Do not leave blank.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifacts checked for mechanism content; if none: "no artifact addresses
    mechanism -- inventory checked: {artifact names}"]
  Finding: [(a) or required absence phrase (b) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: "Run /discover:causal to establish mechanism evidence
    before committing." Rule 2: /discover:causal, not "discover-causal".]

--- Item 2: SEQUENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Did discovery happen before specification? Commitment tends to close off
  investigation. Specs written before discovery signals existed may reflect direction
  chosen before the team knew what they were committing to.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no discovery artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering cannot be established."
  Do not write SEQUENCE OK when no discovery artifacts were checked.

What we found:
  Classify each artifact as discovery (discover, scout, prove, research, listen) or
  commitment (draft, topic, program). Note the date of each.

  Compare dates. State one of:
    (a) "Discovery precedes commitment: [discovery artifact, date] predates [commitment
        artifact, date]."
    (b) "Commitment precedes discovery: [commitment artifact, date] predates [discovery
        artifact, date]. Inversion flagged."
    (c) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering
        cannot be established."
  Rule 1: form (c) is required when no discovery artifacts exist.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifact names and dates compared; if no discovery artifacts: "no discovery
    artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [(a), (b), or required absence phrase (c) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the missing discovery signal and skill using
    /namespace:skill format -- Rule 2]

--- Item 3: STALENESS ---

What we're checking:
  Are your signals fresh enough to act on? Domain velocity determines freshness.
  Fast-moving market: a 30-day-old competitive signal may be unreliable. Stable
  enterprise cycle: a 90-day-old signal may hold. This checks whether artifact
  dates fall within a defensible window for the decisions being made.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no dated artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."
  Do not apply a threshold to an empty inventory without noting the absence.

What we found:
  First, name the threshold:
    "For {topic}'s domain: signals older than [N] days are stale because [reason]."

  Apply to each artifact. State which are within threshold and which are past it.
  Rule 1: if no dated artifacts, write the required absence phrase above.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [each artifact with date; or "no dated artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [fresh/stale breakdown by name; OR required absence phrase:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the stale artifact, its age vs. threshold, and the
    skill to refresh it -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

--- Item 4: COHERENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Do your signals tell a consistent story? When two signals address the same question,
  they should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be visible and deliberate.
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What we found:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

This matters because addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with one action.
Look especially for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase -- one root,
    two symptoms. Action: /discover:causal addresses both.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: spec preceded discovery; mechanism gap is
    downstream of the same premature commitment.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: stale signal is source of contradiction.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."

## V-04: C-37 FAIL + C-38 FAIL -- R11 V-05 verbatim; neither new criterion satisfied

**Variation axis**: C-37 + C-38 combined regression
**Hypothesis**: R11 V-05 verbatim fails both C-37 (ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE retains inline
failure-class labels -- "Rule 1 (absence declaration)", "Rule 2 (skill format)", "Rule 3
(location enumeration)" -- rather than forward-references to top-level headings; C-35 is
satisfied so the precondition holds, but the note does not collapse to forward-refs) and
C-38 (only Rule 3's non-substitutability declaration names reader positions; Rules 1 and
2 carry no reader-position consulting statements). C-35 passes (failure class in all
top-level headings). C-36 passes (Rule 3 names "a committing engineer reading for what
to fix" and "a reviewer reading for what is already lost" in non-substitutability).
C-34 passes (inline labels in ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE carry failure classes). All other
criteria pass. Scores 28/30. The sum of V-01 and V-02 individual deficits. Confirms
C-37 and C-38 are independently isolable from each other: each contributes exactly one
point of deficit; their combination contributes exactly two.

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

  Rule 1 -- Absence Drift -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the

    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps -- RULES WITHOUT DECLARED SCOPE DO NOT EXIST:
    Obligation: every Rule in this STANDING RULES block must declare all output
    locations it governs. Scope must be discharged at rule-creation time, not
    retroactively.
    Existence condition: a Rule that has not declared its scope does not exist as an

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each addresses an
  independent failure mode:
    Rule 1 (absence declaration) -- prevents silent omissions: outputs that appear
      complete but contain no evidence for missing dimensions.
    Rule 2 (skill format) -- prevents reference ambiguity: bare names or imprecise
      references block automated and human consumers from resolving skills.
    Rule 3 (location enumeration) -- prevents constraint scope gaps: a rule without

  they should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be visible and deliberate.
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What we found:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

This matters because addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with one action.
Look especially for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase -- one root,
    two symptoms. Action: /discover:causal addresses both.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: spec preceded discovery; mechanism gap is
    downstream of the same premature commitment.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: stale signal is source of contradiction.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."

## V-05: Full ceiling -- passes all 30/30 under v12

**Variation axis**: Full ceiling (C-37 + C-38)
**Hypothesis**: Adding forward-reference dedup to the ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE (C-37) and
per-rule reader-position consulting statements to Rules 1 and 2 (C-38) yields a 30/30
sweep. ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE replaces inline failure-class labels with forward-ref
pointers ("Rule 1 -- failure class: see Rule 1 heading above") -- making the top-level
heading the single source of truth for failure-class information and the note the
interdependency statement only. Rule 1 body gains: "A committing engineer checking for
missing absence declarations consults this rule to determine which Finding locations
require verbatim phrases when no evidence exists. Silence in any governed location
constitutes absence drift." Rule 2 body gains: "A skill-reference consumer disambiguating
a reference consults this rule to determine whether a skill name in the output can be
resolved to a runnable skill. A bare name or imprecise format in any governed location
constitutes reference ambiguity -- it cannot be resolved without guessing." Rule 3 retains
its C-36 framing. C-37 and C-38 are independently testable: note-level structural choice
(C-37) and per-rule body-level reader framing (C-38) appear at separate structural
locations. Scores 30/30.

**Potential R13 signals from V-05:** (1) ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE after C-37 now contains
forward-refs plus the interdependency declaration plus three inline failure descriptions
("prevents silent omissions", "prevents reference ambiguity", "prevents constraint scope
gaps"); the descriptions are now the note's only inline substantive content; candidate
for whether they should migrate to rule body text, making the note a pure interdependency
statement with no duplicate content; (2) per-rule reader-position consulting statements
in Rules 1 and 2 are structurally unlabeled prose (appended before Applies-to); candidate
for whether they should be structurally labeled (e.g., "Consulting reader:") parallel to
Rule 3's "Obligation:" / "Existence condition:" labeled sections, making the per-rule
reader framing surface-parseable as a structural fact across all three rules.

```
You are running /signal:check for topic: {topic}.

Think of this as a preflight check. The checklist does not decide whether to fly --
it makes sure the pilot sees everything before they decide. Nothing here blocks you
from proceeding. It exists so you know what you know before you commit.

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

  Rule 1 -- Absence Drift -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the
    absence explicitly using the required verbatim phrases specified at each dimension.
    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    A committing engineer checking for missing absence declarations consults this
    rule to determine which Finding locations require verbatim phrases when no
    evidence exists. Silence in any governed location constitutes absence drift.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    A skill-reference consumer disambiguating a reference consults this rule to
    determine whether a skill name in the output can be resolved to a runnable skill.
    A bare name or imprecise format in any governed location constitutes reference
    ambiguity -- it cannot be resolved without guessing.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps -- RULES WITHOUT DECLARED SCOPE DO NOT EXIST:
    Obligation: every Rule in this STANDING RULES block must declare all output
    locations it governs. Scope must be discharged at rule-creation time, not
    retroactively.
    Existence condition: a Rule that has not declared its scope does not exist as an
    active rule. "Not operative" understates the condition -- an inoperative rule
    is still a declared object with suspended force. A rule without scope has no
    force, no scope, and no standing. It does not exist as an active rule.
    These two registers are not substitutes: the obligation tells a committing
    engineer reading for what to fix; the existence condition tells a reviewer
    reading for what is already lost.
    This requirement self-applies: Rule 3 itself declares its scope below.
    A constraint without explicit location scope cannot be verified by section-level
    inspection.
    Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block, including Rule 3
    itself and any rule added in the future.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each addresses an
  independent failure mode -- failure class encoded in each rule's heading above:
    Rule 1 -- failure class: see Rule 1 heading above -- prevents silent omissions:
      outputs that appear complete but contain no evidence for missing dimensions.
    Rule 2 -- failure class: see Rule 2 heading above -- prevents reference ambiguity:
      bare names or imprecise references block automated and human consumers from
      resolving skills.
    Rule 3 -- failure class: see Rule 3 heading above -- prevents constraint scope gaps:
      a rule without explicit location scope cannot be verified without a full-output scan.
  No rule substitutes for another. Satisfying two of three does not constitute a
  passing output. All three must pass for the output to be a valid health report.

=== GATHER YOUR SIGNALS ===

Use Glob: simulations/**/*{topic}*.md

Build the inventory:

  | # | Artifact path | Namespace | Signal type | Date |
  |---|--------------|-----------|-------------|------|

Artifact count: {N}

If no artifacts found: "No signal artifacts exist yet for {topic}. Consider running
/discover:causal, /discover:competitors, or /scout:feasibility before committing." Stop.

=== READINESS SUMMARY ===

[Write this section last -- place it first in the final artifact.]

2-4 sentences: overall signal health for {topic}, which dimensions are clear, which
have gaps worth addressing. If recommending an action, name the skill using
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2). Frame as pilot briefing -- not a verdict. The team
decides.

Rule 1 applies: if no signal artifacts exist, write "No signal artifacts found --
health assessment cannot be made." Do not imply signal health when none was checked.

=== THE PREFLIGHT CHECK ===

Each item uses this structure:

  STATUS: OK | FLAG | OPEN
    OK = no issue
    FLAG = issue found, worth reviewing before committing
    OPEN = gap -- no artifact covers this area
  Basis: [name the specific artifacts examined -- with dates; "see above" does not pass;
    if no artifacts cover the area, write "no artifact covers [question]"]
  Finding: [specific named observation; OR required verbatim absence phrase -- Rule 1
    applies: use the exact required phrase, do not leave blank, do not hedge]
  Action: [required if STATUS is FLAG or OPEN; must use /namespace:skill format --
    Rule 2; omit only when STATUS is OK]

Work through all four items. Order is intentional: start with the causal question.

--- Item 1: CAUSAL GAP ---

What we're checking:
  Do you have evidence for why the feature causes the claimed outcome -- not just
  that it might, but how? This is the signal teams gather last, if ever. A full
  discovery stack can exist while the mechanism remains uninvestigated.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no mechanism evidence is found, write this exactly:
    "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal gap is open."
  Do not substitute, hedge, or leave the Finding blank. This exact wording is required.

What we found:

  Step 1: Name the claimed outcome for {topic}:
    "The claimed outcome is: [outcome]."
    If not stated in any artifact: "The claimed outcome is not named in any artifact --
    this is itself a gap."

  Step 2: Define mechanism evidence -- a causal chain of observable intermediate steps
  from feature to outcome. Not:
    - A correlation ("users who use X have better Y scores")
    - An outcome claim ("users will benefit")
    - A proxy metric ("adoption rate will increase")
  Is: "Feature causes outcome because [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."

  Step 3: Scan every artifact. State one of:
    (a) "Mechanism evidence found: [artifact, date] establishes [mechanism] by tracing
        [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."
    (b) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal
        gap is open."
  Rule 1: form (b) is required when no mechanism evidence exists. Do not leave blank.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifacts checked for mechanism content; if none: "no artifact addresses
    mechanism -- inventory checked: {artifact names}"]
  Finding: [(a) or required absence phrase (b) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: "Run /discover:causal to establish mechanism evidence
    before committing." Rule 2: /discover:causal, not "discover-causal".]

--- Item 2: SEQUENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Did discovery happen before specification? Commitment tends to close off
  investigation. Specs written before discovery signals existed may reflect direction
  chosen before the team knew what they were committing to.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no discovery artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering cannot be established."
  Do not write SEQUENCE OK when no discovery artifacts were checked.

What we found:
  Classify each artifact as discovery (discover, scout, prove, research, listen) or
  commitment (draft, topic, program). Note the date of each.

  Compare dates. State one of:
    (a) "Discovery precedes commitment: [discovery artifact, date] predates [commitment
        artifact, date]."
    (b) "Commitment precedes discovery: [commitment artifact, date] predates [discovery
        artifact, date]. Inversion flagged."
    (c) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering
        cannot be established."
  Rule 1: form (c) is required when no discovery artifacts exist.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifact names and dates compared; if no discovery artifacts: "no discovery
    artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [(a), (b), or required absence phrase (c) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the missing discovery signal and skill using
    /namespace:skill format -- Rule 2]

--- Item 3: STALENESS ---

What we're checking:
  Are your signals fresh enough to act on? Domain velocity determines freshness.
  Fast-moving market: a 30-day-old competitive signal may be unreliable. Stable
  enterprise cycle: a 90-day-old signal may hold. This checks whether artifact
  dates fall within a defensible window for the decisions being made.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no dated artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."
  Do not apply a threshold to an empty inventory without noting the absence.

What we found:
  First, name the threshold:
    "For {topic}'s domain: signals older than [N] days are stale because [reason]."

  Apply to each artifact. State which are within threshold and which are past it.
  Rule 1: if no dated artifacts, write the required absence phrase above.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [each artifact with date; or "no dated artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [fresh/stale breakdown by name; OR required absence phrase:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the stale artifact, its age vs. threshold, and the
    skill to refresh it -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

--- Item 4: COHERENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Do your signals tell a consistent story? When two signals address the same question,
  they should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be visible and deliberate.
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What we found:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

This matters because addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with one action.
Look especially for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase -- one root,
    two symptoms. Action: /discover:causal addresses both.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: spec preceded discovery; mechanism gap is
    downstream of the same premature commitment.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: stale signal is source of contradiction.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."
