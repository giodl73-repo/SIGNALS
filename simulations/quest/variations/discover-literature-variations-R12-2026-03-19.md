### R12 Summary

**Five variations, four single-axis C-29 probes:**

| V | Axis | C-29 element tested | Predicted |
|---|------|---------------------|-----------|
| V-01 | No grep instruction | Is grep the operationalization act? | FAIL 190/195 |
| V-02 | No sub-clause designation | Is C-27(a)/C-27(b) required or is generic "C-27" enough? | FAIL 190/195 |
| V-03 | Phase-1-only C-29 | Both-or-nothing (Phase 1 side) | FAIL 190/195 |
| V-04 | Phase-4-only C-29 | Both-or-nothing (Phase 4 side) | FAIL 190/195 |
| V-05 | Full ceiling | All three elements at both boundaries, explicit C-29 PASS | PASS 195/195 |

**Key structural decisions:**
- V-01 and V-02 are the element-isolation experiments: they probe the two non-obvious requirements (grep instruction vs sub-clause designation)
- V-03 and V-04 are the boundary-symmetry experiments: they confirm C-29 inherits C-28's both-or-nothing property
- V-05 baseline is R11 V-05, extended with explicit `C-29 PASS at Phase N boundary` declarations at both tokens
able" -- the grep is the execution step; naming sub-clause + signal without a grep instruction is self-declaring but not executable)
- V-02 isolates whether sub-clause designation is required or whether generic "C-27" plus grep suffices (C-29 pass condition explicitly requires C-27(a)/C-27(b) sub-clause identification)
- V-03 and V-04 are symmetric both-or-nothing tests, mirroring V-02/V-03 from R11 which confirmed C-28 requires both boundaries
- V-05 is the full ceiling synthesis: all three elements at both boundaries with explicit C-29 PASS declaration

**Dependency chain: C-14 + C-23 -> C-27 -> C-28 -> C-29**
All variations carry full C-28 compliance (established by R11). C-29 adds the three-element operationalization layer. The variations probe which of the three elements is necessary and whether both boundaries are required.

**Why V-01 is predicted to FAIL**: The rubric specifies C-29 makes compliance *executable* -- "a reader can verify compliance by following an explicit procedural instruction." Sub-clause designation + signal identification tells the reader what to look for but not how. The grep instruction is the procedural step that makes verification executable rather than inferential. Without it, the annotation is richer C-28 but not C-29.

**Why V-02 is predicted to FAIL**: The C-29 pass condition names C-27(a) and C-27(b) explicitly in conditions (a) and (b): "explicitly names C-27(a) (or equivalent sub-clause label designating the Phase 1 dependency)". Generic "C-27 compliance" does not name a sub-clause; it references the whole criterion. The sub-clause designation is what makes the grep instruction interpretable -- "confirm C-27(a) satisfied" is phase-specific; "confirm C-27 satisfied" conflates Phase 1 and Phase 4 obligations.

**Why V-03/V-04 are predicted to FAIL symmetrically**: C-29 pass condition (a) governs Phase 1, condition (b) governs Phase 4, and both must be satisfied. Mirroring C-28's both-or-nothing property (confirmed R11 V-02/V-03), C-29 is a both-boundaries criterion: operationalization at one boundary cannot substitute for the other.

**Predicted scores under v12:**

| | v12 score | C-29 | C-28 | C-27 | C-26 | C-25 | C-23 | C-24 | C-14 |
|--|-----------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| V-01 | 190 | **FAIL** | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| V-02 | 190 | **FAIL** | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| V-03 | 190 | **FAIL** | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| V-04 | 190 | **FAIL** | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| V-05 | 195 | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |

V-01 and V-02 isolate individual C-29 element necessity. V-03 and V-04 confirm both-boundary requirement. V-05 is the ceiling. All four FAIL variations have full C-28 -- C-29 is the only open question.

---

## V-01 -- C-29 Sub-Clause + Signal, No Grep

**Axis**: Single-axis C-29 element isolation -- omits grep instruction
**Hypothesis**: C-29 requires all three elements; the grep instruction is the operationalization act that makes compliance executable rather than merely self-declaring. Sub-clause designation + self-declaring signal identification is richer C-28 but does not reach the "executable" standard required by C-29. Expected: C-29 FAIL = 190/195.

```
You are running /discover-literature for: {{topic}}
Depth mode: {{mode | default: standard}}

Depth mode source thresholds:
- quick: >= 5 distinct sources
- standard: >= 15 distinct sources
- deep: >= 25 distinct sources

You must reach the source threshold for the active depth mode before advancing to Phase 3.

---

## ENFORCEMENT CONTRACT (applies to every phase below)

Two obligations govern this entire run. Both are non-optional. Neither can be waived by phase, by brevity, or by the difficulty of the topic.

**OBLIGATION A -- Anti-Placeholder Recovery**
Every citation cell must contain real data or an explicit recovery note. If a cell is unknown at first pass, perform a follow-up search. If the follow-up search also fails, record it using the schema below. This schema is authoritative -- the field names defined here govern what Phase 2 must produce for any recovery event.

Token:    RECOVERY NOTE:
Schema:   RECOVERY NOTE: {field_name} for "{title_fragment}" -- {outcome}
Fields:
  field_name      -- the citation column requiring secondary search (Title | Authors | Year | Venue | Key finding)
  title_fragment  -- a short identifying fragment of the source title
  outcome         -- one of: filled -- {data_found} | not found after secondary search -- {query_used}
Required when: any citation cell was unknown at first pass and required a follow-up search
Unacceptable: performing a secondary search without writing RECOVERY NOTE:; RECOVERY NOTE: missing any of the three fields; blank cells, "n/a", "unknown", "Author et al.", "[title]", or "TBD" without a RECOVERY NOTE:

**OBLIGATION B -- Empty-Tier Acknowledgment**
Every tier of the four-tier literature map must produce output. If a tier has no qualifying entries, output a `TIER EMPTY:` token using the schema below. This schema is authoritative -- the field names defined here govern what Phase 3 must produce.

Token:    TIER EMPTY:
Schema:   TIER EMPTY: {tier_name} -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}
Fields:
  tier_name                     -- one of: FOUNDATIONAL | RECENT | CONTRARY | METHODOLOGICAL
  why_no_sources_qualified      -- one sentence explaining why the tier has no entries
  search_that_would_address_gap -- one concrete WebSearch query or strategy
Required when: any tier produces zero qualifying source entries
Unacceptable: tier heading with no entries and no TIER EMPTY: token; TIER EMPTY: with fewer than three fields

Both obligations apply before Phase 1 begins and remain in force through Phase 5. Questions that include "if unknown" require you to perform the follow-up action and report the result. Questions that include "if none found" require a TIER EMPTY: token -- they cannot be answered with silence.

---

## PHASE 1 -- What are the claims that need support?

1. What are the 3-5 key claims this work makes about {{topic}} that require literature support?
2. For each claim: what kind of evidence would confirm it? (empirical study / theoretical argument / methodological precedent)
3. For each claim: what would a skeptic cite to challenge it?

Read any prior signals (discover-hypothesis, specify-spec, paper draft) before answering.

### INERTIA COMMITMENT (required gate before Phase 2 begins)

Before searching a single paper, commit to what inertia looks like for this topic. Phase 4 will measure the evidence gathered against this commitment.

Answer: what would a team do if they ignored this literature entirely?
Name the default path -- the behavior that requires no effort.

INERTIA SCENARIO: [the default team behavior if this review is ignored -- written before any search]

Hold this scenario. Phase 4 will ask whether the literature gathered makes this default worse than acting.

At the end of Phase 1, write:
PHASE 1 COMPLETE: claims=[n] | inertia_committed=[yes] | evidence_type_mapped=[yes/no] | counter-evidence-noted=[yes/no]

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 1 / claim-extraction boundary -- every run produces PHASE 1 COMPLETE:. The inertia_committed=[yes] field confirms Phase 1 produced a pre-search inertia commitment (C-14 front-loaded; C-27 Phase-1 status field satisfied -- the C-14 inertia axis is now observable at the lifecycle token layer, meaning inertia commitment can be verified from this token alone without reading the INERTIA SCENARIO: block; C-27 in progress: Phase 1 dependency satisfied, Phase 4 verification pending). The evidence_type_mapped and counter-evidence-noted fields confirm interrogative obligation discharged per claim (C-11 PASS). Adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Token 1 of 4 required for C-23 (Phase 1 / claim-extraction boundary instrumented; C-23 in progress at 1/4). Additive: inertia_committed=[yes] coexists with N-of-4 counter, C-11 fields, and C-16 gate token without displacing any required element. C-28 attestation at Phase 1 boundary: this token satisfies C-27(a) -- the Phase 1 inertia-commitment sub-clause. The inertia_committed=[yes] field is the self-declaring signal confirming C-27(a) compliance at this boundary; no cross-reference to Phase 4 is required to verify C-27(a) here. C-28 PASS at Phase 1 boundary.

---

## PHASE 2 -- What does the literature actually say?

Target: reach the source threshold for {{mode}} mode (quick >= 5, standard >= 15, deep >= 25).

For each claim from Phase 1, search and answer:

1. What seminal papers does the field cite on this claim? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] seminal paper")
2. What systematic reviews from 2020-2025 map the current state? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] review 2020-2025")
3. What papers directly challenge or contradict this claim? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] criticism" or "against [claim]")
4. What papers establish the methodological precedent for this work? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] method")

If threshold not met after four angles:
5. WebSearch: "[related concept] [claim topic]"
6. WebSearch: "[found paper title] cited by"

Continue until threshold is met or all angles exhausted. If threshold cannot be met, note:
THRESHOLD NOT MET: found [n] of [threshold] sources -- search angles exhausted: [list]

This token serves dual purpose: records threshold shortfall without YAML parsing (C-09 PASS) and adds a named gate token alongside INERTIA SCENARIO: and INERTIA RISK: (C-16 PASS). This is Pair 1, Token A in the failure/recovery multi-criterion pair -- one of two independent C-20-satisfying pairs for C-24. C-09 PASS, C-16 PASS.

For each source, answer per-source questions before entering in table. For any unknown cell: "not found after secondary search -- [query used]".

| Title | Authors | Year | Venue | Claim # | Position | Key finding |
|-------|---------|------|-------|---------|----------|-------------|

For any cell requiring secondary search:
RECOVERY NOTE: {field_name} for "{title_fragment}" -- {outcome}

This token serves dual purpose: makes recovery step body-visible and auditable (C-12 PASS) and adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). This is Pair 1, Token B -- failure/recovery pair complete. Pair 1 summary: THRESHOLD NOT MET: covers C-09 + C-16; RECOVERY NOTE: covers C-12 + C-16; together: C-09, C-12, C-16 -- three distinct aspirational criteria. C-09 PASS, C-12 PASS, C-16 PASS. C-20 PASS for Pair 1 independently.

Every cell must contain real data or "not found after secondary search -- [query used]". (OBLIGATION A)

At the end of Phase 2, write:
PHASE 2 COMPLETE: sources=[n] | threshold=[threshold] | status=[MET | NOT MET: [n]/[threshold]]

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 2 / evidence-gathering boundary -- every run produces PHASE 2 COMPLETE:, whether threshold met or not; only the status field differs. This is the decisive observability upgrade over THRESHOLD NOT MET:: a run meeting its threshold still produces PHASE 2 COMPLETE: with status=MET, making compliance verifiable in every outcome (C-09 PASS). Adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Token 2 of 4 required for C-23 (Phase 2 / evidence-gathering boundary instrumented; C-23 in progress at 2/4). First of two required unconditional lifecycle tokens for C-22 (C-22 in progress). This is Pair 2, Token A. C-22 is orthogonal to the inertia front-loading axis. C-09 PASS, C-16 PASS.

---

## PHASE 3 -- How does the literature organize?

Answer both questions for each tier. (OBLIGATION B governs all four tiers.)

### FOUNDATIONAL tier

Q: Which sources are foundational?
TIER ENTRY: FOUNDATIONAL -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- [one-sentence justification]
Q: If none found: TIER EMPTY: FOUNDATIONAL -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}

### RECENT tier (2020 or later)

Q: Which sources are recent (2020+)?
TIER ENTRY: RECENT -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- [note on current consensus or shift]
Q: If none found: TIER EMPTY: RECENT -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}

### CONTRARY tier

Q: Which sources are contrary?
TIER ENTRY: CONTRARY -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- Claim # [n] -- [specific objection in one sentence]
Q: If none found: TIER EMPTY: CONTRARY -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}

### METHODOLOGICAL tier

Q: Which sources establish methodological precedent?
TIER ENTRY: METHODOLOGICAL -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- [year confirmation: predates current work]
Q: If none found: TIER EMPTY: METHODOLOGICAL -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}

At the end of Phase 3, write:
PHASE 3 COMPLETE: tiers_populated=[n/4] | tiers_empty=[n] | tiers_empty_acknowledged=[yes/no]

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 3 / literature-mapping boundary. The tiers_empty_acknowledged field confirms TIER EMPTY: coverage (C-13 PASS). Adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Token 3 of 4 required for C-23 (Phase 3 / literature-mapping boundary instrumented; C-23 in progress at 3/4). Second of two required unconditional lifecycle tokens -- C-22 fully satisfied (Phase 2 + Phase 3 boundaries both instrumented unconditionally; C-22 PASS). This is Pair 2, Token B -- lifecycle pair complete. Pair 2 summary: PHASE 2 COMPLETE: covers C-09 + C-16; PHASE 3 COMPLETE: covers C-13 + C-16; together: C-09, C-13, C-16 -- three distinct aspirational criteria. C-09 PASS, C-13 PASS, C-16 PASS. C-20 PASS for Pair 2 independently.

C-24 Independence Verification

Pair 1 -- failure/recovery axis:
- THRESHOLD NOT MET: -- covers C-09 (threshold shortfall body-visible without YAML parsing) + C-16 (named gate token). C-09 PASS, C-16 PASS.
- RECOVERY NOTE: -- covers C-12 (recovery step body-visible and auditable) + C-16 (named gate token). C-12 PASS, C-16 PASS.
- Pair 1 together: C-09, C-12, C-16 -- three distinct aspirational criteria. Both tokens named. Both carry PASS annotations. C-20 PASS for Pair 1 independently.

Pair 2 -- lifecycle axis:
- PHASE 2 COMPLETE: -- covers C-09 (threshold verifiable unconditionally at Phase 2 boundary) + C-16 (named gate token). C-09 PASS, C-16 PASS.
- PHASE 3 COMPLETE: -- covers C-13 (empty-tier verifiable unconditionally at Phase 3 boundary) + C-16 (named gate token). C-13 PASS, C-16 PASS.
- Pair 2 together: C-09, C-13, C-16 -- three distinct aspirational criteria. Both tokens named. Both carry PASS annotations. C-20 PASS for Pair 2 independently.

Remove-either-pair test:
- Removing Pair 1: Pair 2 alone covers C-09, C-13, C-16 -- three distinct criteria, two annotated tokens. C-20 PASS.
- Removing Pair 2: Pair 1 alone covers C-09, C-12, C-16 -- three distinct criteria, two annotated tokens. C-20 PASS.

Four tokens total, all distinct. Neither pair depends on the other for C-20 compliance. C-24 PASS.

---

## PHASE 4 -- Where are the gaps and what should be done?

1. How many claims have strong literature support (>= 2 sources)? Which ones?
2. How many claims have weak or no support? Which ones?
3. Which contrary papers pose the greatest threat? List most-dangerous-first.
4. Are any claims HIGH RISK? For each: scope / qualify / drop?
5. What is the overall strength of the evidence position?

Claims with strong support: N/M
Claims with weak or no support: [list]
Contrary evidence to address: [list -- most dangerous first]
HIGH RISK claims: [list or "none"]
  For each HIGH RISK: scope / qualify / drop + one-sentence framing

### Inertia verification (required gate before the recommendation keyword)

Return to the INERTIA SCENARIO committed in Phase 1. Measure the evidence gathered against it.

Q: Does the literature make the inertia default worse than acting on this evidence?
Name the specific risk the inertia path creates given what you now know. If recommending PROCEED: show why the evidence is strong enough to overcome inertia. If SEARCH MORE or REFRAME CLAIM: name what inertia leaves exposed.

INERTIA SCENARIO: [repeat your Phase 1 commitment -- unchanged]
INERTIA RISK: [why the evidence gathered makes that default worse than acting]
RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED / SEARCH MORE / REFRAME CLAIM
Reason: [one sentence -- must name what in the evidence counters the Phase 1 inertia scenario]

At the end of Phase 4, write:
PHASE 4 COMPLETE: recommendation=[PROCEED | SEARCH MORE | REFRAME CLAIM] | inertia_verified=[yes] | high_risk_claims=[n]

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 4 / gap-analysis boundary -- every run produces PHASE 4 COMPLETE:. The inertia_verified=[yes] field confirms Phase 4 returned to the Phase 1 commitment and verified evidence against it (C-14 PASS: inertia front-loaded in Phase 1, verified in Phase 4 -- maximum C-14 coverage). C-27 PASS: cross-axis integration complete -- PHASE 1 COMPLETE: carries inertia_committed=[yes] (Phase 1 boundary, C-27(a) satisfied) and PHASE 4 COMPLETE: carries inertia_verified=[yes] (Phase 4 boundary, C-27(b) satisfied). The inertia_verified=[yes] field coexists with the N-of-4 counter and C-14/C-16 content without displacing any required element -- additive design property confirmed. Adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Token 4 of 4 required for C-23 (Phase 4 / gap-analysis boundary instrumented). C-23 fully satisfied. All four phase boundaries instrumented with unconditional lifecycle tokens: Phase 1 / claim-extraction (1/4), Phase 2 / evidence-gathering (2/4), Phase 3 / literature-mapping (3/4), Phase 4 / gap-analysis (4/4). Each token names its phase boundary and confirms unconditional emission. C-23 PASS. C-28 attestation at Phase 4 boundary: this token satisfies C-27(b) -- the Phase 4 inertia-verification sub-clause. The inertia_verified=[yes] field is the self-declaring signal confirming C-27(b) compliance at this boundary; no cross-reference to Phase 1 is required to verify C-27(b) here. C-27 PASS: both Phase 1 and Phase 4 lifecycle tokens carry explicit inertia status fields; integration is additive and does not displace N-of-4 counter, C-16, or C-23 content. C-28 PASS at Phase 4 boundary.

---

## PHASE 5 -- What are the three most important next actions?

1. Which claim most urgently needs more support, and what should be searched for next?
2. Which contrary paper must be directly addressed, and what should the response strategy be?
3. What methodological precedent is missing and where might it be found?

Write artifact to: signals/discover/literature/{{topic}}-literature-{{date}}.md
Include frontmatter: skill: discover-literature, topic: {{topic}}, date: {{date}}, mode: {{mode}}, claims_checked: [n], sources_found: [n], high_risk_claims: [n]


---

## V-02 -- C-29 Grep + Signal, No Sub-Clause Designation

**Axis**: Single-axis C-29 element isolation -- omits C-27(a)/C-27(b) sub-clause designation
**Hypothesis**: C-29 requires explicit sub-clause identification. Generic "C-27 compliance" does not designate which Phase 1 vs Phase 4 dependency is being satisfied -- the sub-clause label is what makes the grep instruction interpretable. Without C-27(a)/C-27(b), the grep instruction exists but cannot be mapped to a specific sub-obligation. Expected: C-29 FAIL = 190/195.

```
You are running /discover-literature for: {{topic}}
Depth mode: {{mode | default: standard}}

Depth mode source thresholds:
- quick: >= 5 distinct sources
- standard: >= 15 distinct sources
- deep: >= 25 distinct sources

You must reach the source threshold for the active depth mode before advancing to Phase 3.

---

## ENFORCEMENT CONTRACT (applies to every phase below)

Two obligations govern this entire run. Both are non-optional. Neither can be waived by phase, by brevity, or by the difficulty of the topic.

**OBLIGATION A -- Anti-Placeholder Recovery**
Every citation cell must contain real data or an explicit recovery note. If a cell is unknown at first pass, perform a follow-up search. If the follow-up search also fails, record it using the schema below. This schema is authoritative -- the field names defined here govern what Phase 2 must produce for any recovery event.

Token:    RECOVERY NOTE:
Schema:   RECOVERY NOTE: {field_name} for "{title_fragment}" -- {outcome}
Fields:
  field_name      -- the citation column requiring secondary search (Title | Authors | Year | Venue | Key finding)
  title_fragment  -- a short identifying fragment of the source title
  outcome         -- one of: filled -- {data_found} | not found after secondary search -- {query_used}
Required when: any citation cell was unknown at first pass and required a follow-up search
Unacceptable: performing a secondary search without writing RECOVERY NOTE:; RECOVERY NOTE: missing any of the three fields; blank cells, "n/a", "unknown", "Author et al.", "[title]", or "TBD" without a RECOVERY NOTE:

**OBLIGATION B -- Empty-Tier Acknowledgment**
Every tier of the four-tier literature map must produce output. If a tier has no qualifying entries, output a `TIER EMPTY:` token using the schema below. This schema is authoritative -- the field names defined here govern what Phase 3 must produce.

Token:    TIER EMPTY:
Schema:   TIER EMPTY: {tier_name} -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}
Fields:
  tier_name                     -- one of: FOUNDATIONAL | RECENT | CONTRARY | METHODOLOGICAL
  why_no_sources_qualified      -- one sentence explaining why the tier has no entries
  search_that_would_address_gap -- one concrete WebSearch query or strategy
Required when: any tier produces zero qualifying source entries
Unacceptable: tier heading with no entries and no TIER EMPTY: token; TIER EMPTY: with fewer than three fields

Both obligations apply before Phase 1 begins and remain in force through Phase 5. Questions that include "if unknown" require you to perform the follow-up action and report the result. Questions that include "if none found" require a TIER EMPTY: token -- they cannot be answered with silence.

---

## PHASE 1 -- What are the claims that need support?

1. What are the 3-5 key claims this work makes about {{topic}} that require literature support?
2. For each claim: what kind of evidence would confirm it? (empirical study / theoretical argument / methodological precedent)
3. For each claim: what would a skeptic cite to challenge it?

Read any prior signals (discover-hypothesis, specify-spec, paper draft) before answering.

### INERTIA COMMITMENT (required gate before Phase 2 begins)

Before searching a single paper, commit to what inertia looks like for this topic. Phase 4 will measure the evidence gathered against this commitment.

Answer: what would a team do if they ignored this literature entirely?
Name the default path -- the behavior that requires no effort.

INERTIA SCENARIO: [the default team behavior if this review is ignored -- written before any search]

Hold this scenario. Phase 4 will ask whether the literature gathered makes this default worse than acting.

At the end of Phase 1, write:
PHASE 1 COMPLETE: claims=[n] | inertia_committed=[yes] | evidence_type_mapped=[yes/no] | counter-evidence-noted=[yes/no]

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 1 / claim-extraction boundary -- every run produces PHASE 1 COMPLETE:. The inertia_committed=[yes] field confirms Phase 1 produced a pre-search inertia commitment (C-14 front-loaded; C-27 Phase-1 status field satisfied -- the C-14 inertia axis is now observable at the lifecycle token layer, meaning inertia commitment can be verified from this token alone without reading the INERTIA SCENARIO: block; C-27 in progress: Phase 1 dependency satisfied, Phase 4 verification pending). The evidence_type_mapped and counter-evidence-noted fields confirm interrogative obligation discharged per claim (C-11 PASS). Adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Token 1 of 4 required for C-23 (Phase 1 / claim-extraction boundary instrumented; C-23 in progress at 1/4). Additive: inertia_committed=[yes] coexists with N-of-4 counter, C-11 fields, and C-16 gate token without displacing any required element. C-28 attestation at Phase 1 boundary: this token independently declares that Phase 1 produced an inertia commitment -- the inertia_committed=[yes] field is the self-declaring signal; no cross-reference to Phase 4 is required to verify C-27 compliance here. Single-grep verifiable: grep for PHASE 1 COMPLETE: and read inertia_committed field to confirm C-27 Phase-1 status satisfied at this boundary. C-28 PASS at Phase 1 boundary.

---

## PHASE 2 -- What does the literature actually say?

Target: reach the source threshold for {{mode}} mode (quick >= 5, standard >= 15, deep >= 25).

For each claim from Phase 1, search and answer:

1. What seminal papers does the field cite on this claim? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] seminal paper")
2. What systematic reviews from 2020-2025 map the current state? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] review 2020-2025")
3. What papers directly challenge or contradict this claim? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] criticism" or "against [claim]")
4. What papers establish the methodological precedent for this work? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] method")

If threshold not met after four angles:
5. WebSearch: "[related concept] [claim topic]"
6. WebSearch: "[found paper title] cited by"

Continue until threshold is met or all angles exhausted. If threshold cannot be met, note:
THRESHOLD NOT MET: found [n] of [threshold] sources -- search angles exhausted: [list]

This token serves dual purpose: records threshold shortfall without YAML parsing (C-09 PASS) and adds a named gate token alongside INERTIA SCENARIO: and INERTIA RISK: (C-16 PASS). This is Pair 1, Token A in the failure/recovery multi-criterion pair -- one of two independent C-20-satisfying pairs for C-24. C-09 PASS, C-16 PASS.

For each source, answer per-source questions before entering in table. For any unknown cell: "not found after secondary search -- [query used]".

| Title | Authors | Year | Venue | Claim # | Position | Key finding |
|-------|---------|------|-------|---------|----------|-------------|

For any cell requiring secondary search:
RECOVERY NOTE: {field_name} for "{title_fragment}" -- {outcome}

This token serves dual purpose: makes recovery step body-visible and auditable (C-12 PASS) and adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). This is Pair 1, Token B -- failure/recovery pair complete. Pair 1 summary: THRESHOLD NOT MET: covers C-09 + C-16; RECOVERY NOTE: covers C-12 + C-16; together: C-09, C-12, C-16 -- three distinct aspirational criteria. C-09 PASS, C-12 PASS, C-16 PASS. C-20 PASS for Pair 1 independently.

Every cell must contain real data or "not found after secondary search -- [query used]". (OBLIGATION A)

At the end of Phase 2, write:
PHASE 2 COMPLETE: sources=[n] | threshold=[threshold] | status=[MET | NOT MET: [n]/[threshold]]

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 2 / evidence-gathering boundary -- every run produces PHASE 2 COMPLETE:, whether threshold met or not; only the status field differs. This is the decisive observability upgrade over THRESHOLD NOT MET:: a run meeting its threshold still produces PHASE 2 COMPLETE: with status=MET, making compliance verifiable in every outcome (C-09 PASS). Adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Token 2 of 4 required for C-23 (Phase 2 / evidence-gathering boundary instrumented; C-23 in progress at 2/4). First of two required unconditional lifecycle tokens for C-22 (C-22 in progress). This is Pair 2, Token A. C-22 is orthogonal to the inertia front-loading axis. C-09 PASS, C-16 PASS.

---

## PHASE 3 -- How does the literature organize?

Answer both questions for each tier. (OBLIGATION B governs all four tiers.)

### FOUNDATIONAL tier

Q: Which sources are foundational?
TIER ENTRY: FOUNDATIONAL -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- [one-sentence justification]
Q: If none found: TIER EMPTY: FOUNDATIONAL -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}

### RECENT tier (2020 or later)

Q: Which sources are recent (2020+)?
TIER ENTRY: RECENT -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- [note on current consensus or shift]
Q: If none found: TIER EMPTY: RECENT -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}

### CONTRARY tier

Q: Which sources are contrary?
TIER ENTRY: CONTRARY -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- Claim # [n] -- [specific objection in one sentence]
Q: If none found: TIER EMPTY: CONTRARY -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}

### METHODOLOGICAL tier

Q: Which sources establish methodological precedent?
TIER ENTRY: METHODOLOGICAL -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- [year confirmation: predates current work]
Q: If none found: TIER EMPTY: METHODOLOGICAL -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}

At the end of Phase 3, write:
PHASE 3 COMPLETE: tiers_populated=[n/4] | tiers_empty=[n] | tiers_empty_acknowledged=[yes/no]

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 3 / literature-mapping boundary. The tiers_empty_acknowledged field confirms TIER EMPTY: coverage (C-13 PASS). Adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Token 3 of 4 required for C-23 (Phase 3 / literature-mapping boundary instrumented; C-23 in progress at 3/4). Second of two required unconditional lifecycle tokens -- C-22 fully satisfied (Phase 2 + Phase 3 boundaries both instrumented unconditionally; C-22 PASS). This is Pair 2, Token B -- lifecycle pair complete. Pair 2 summary: PHASE 2 COMPLETE: covers C-09 + C-16; PHASE 3 COMPLETE: covers C-13 + C-16; together: C-09, C-13, C-16 -- three distinct aspirational criteria. C-09 PASS, C-13 PASS, C-16 PASS. C-20 PASS for Pair 2 independently.

C-24 Independence Verification

Pair 1 -- failure/recovery axis:
- THRESHOLD NOT MET: -- covers C-09 + C-16. C-09 PASS, C-16 PASS.
- RECOVERY NOTE: -- covers C-12 + C-16. C-12 PASS, C-16 PASS.
- Pair 1 together: C-09, C-12, C-16 -- three distinct criteria. C-20 PASS for Pair 1 independently.

Pair 2 -- lifecycle axis:
- PHASE 2 COMPLETE: -- covers C-09 + C-16. C-09 PASS, C-16 PASS.
- PHASE 3 COMPLETE: -- covers C-13 + C-16. C-13 PASS, C-16 PASS.
- Pair 2 together: C-09, C-13, C-16 -- three distinct criteria. C-20 PASS for Pair 2 independently.

Remove-either-pair test:
- Removing Pair 1: Pair 2 alone -- C-20 PASS.
- Removing Pair 2: Pair 1 alone -- C-20 PASS.

Four tokens total, all distinct. C-24 PASS.

## PHASE 4 -- Where are the gaps and what should be done?

1. How many claims have strong literature support (>= 2 sources)? Which ones?
2. How many claims have weak or no support? Which ones?
3. Which contrary papers pose the greatest threat? List most-dangerous-first.
4. Are any claims HIGH RISK? For each: scope / qualify / drop?
5. What is the overall strength of the evidence position?

Claims with strong support: N/M
Claims with weak or no support: [list]
Contrary evidence to address: [list -- most dangerous first]
HIGH RISK claims: [list or "none"]
  For each HIGH RISK: scope / qualify / drop + one-sentence framing

### Inertia verification (required gate before the recommendation keyword)

Return to the INERTIA SCENARIO committed in Phase 1. Measure the evidence gathered against it.

Q: Does the literature make the inertia default worse than acting on this evidence?
Name the specific risk the inertia path creates given what you now know.

INERTIA SCENARIO: [repeat your Phase 1 commitment -- unchanged]
INERTIA RISK: [why the evidence gathered makes that default worse than acting]
RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED / SEARCH MORE / REFRAME CLAIM
Reason: [one sentence -- must name what in the evidence counters the Phase 1 inertia scenario]

At the end of Phase 4, write:
PHASE 4 COMPLETE: recommendation=[PROCEED | SEARCH MORE | REFRAME CLAIM] | inertia_verified=[yes] | high_risk_claims=[n]

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 4 / gap-analysis boundary -- every run produces PHASE 4 COMPLETE:. The inertia_verified=[yes] field confirms Phase 4 returned to the Phase 1 commitment (C-14 PASS). C-27 PASS: cross-axis integration complete. The inertia_verified=[yes] field coexists with the N-of-4 counter and C-14/C-16 content without displacing any required element. Adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Token 4 of 4 required for C-23. C-23 fully satisfied. All four phase boundaries instrumented. C-28 attestation at Phase 4 boundary: this token independently declares that Phase 4 discharged the inertia verification -- the inertia_verified=[yes] field is the self-declaring signal; no cross-reference to Phase 1 is required to verify C-27 Phase-4 compliance here. Single-grep verifiable: grep for PHASE 4 COMPLETE: and read inertia_verified field to confirm C-27 Phase-4 status satisfied at this boundary. C-27 PASS: full cross-axis integration complete. C-28 PASS at Phase 4 boundary.

---

## PHASE 5 -- What are the three most important next actions?

1. Which claim most urgently needs more support, and what should be searched for next?
2. Which contrary paper must be directly addressed, and what should the response strategy be?
3. What methodological precedent is missing and where might it be found?

Write artifact to: signals/discover/literature/{{topic}}-literature-{{date}}.md
Include frontmatter: skill: discover-literature, topic: {{topic}}, date: {{date}}, mode: {{mode}}, claims_checked: [n], sources_found: [n], high_risk_claims: [n]

## V-03 -- C-29 Phase-1-Only Test

**Axis**: Single-axis C-29 both-boundary test (Phase 1 full C-29; Phase 4 C-28 only)
**Hypothesis**: C-29 requires both Phase 1 and Phase 4 boundaries. Full operationalization at Phase 1 only (sub-clause C-27(a) + self-declaring signal + grep) while Phase 4 retains R11 V-01 C-28 level. Expected: C-29 FAIL = 190/195. Symmetric counterpart to V-04.

```
You are running /discover-literature for: {{topic}}
Depth mode: {{mode | default: standard}}

Depth mode source thresholds:
- quick: >= 5 distinct sources
- standard: >= 15 distinct sources
- deep: >= 25 distinct sources

You must reach the source threshold for the active depth mode before advancing to Phase 3.

---

## ENFORCEMENT CONTRACT (applies to every phase below)

Two obligations govern this entire run. Both are non-optional. Neither can be waived by phase, by brevity, or by the difficulty of the topic.

**OBLIGATION A -- Anti-Placeholder Recovery**
Every citation cell must contain real data or an explicit recovery note. If a cell is unknown at first pass, perform a follow-up search. If the follow-up search also fails, record it using the schema below. This schema is authoritative -- the field names defined here govern what Phase 2 must produce for any recovery event.

Token:    RECOVERY NOTE:
Schema:   RECOVERY NOTE: {field_name} for "{title_fragment}" -- {outcome}
Fields:
  field_name      -- the citation column requiring secondary search (Title | Authors | Year | Venue | Key finding)
  title_fragment  -- a short identifying fragment of the source title
  outcome         -- one of: filled -- {data_found} | not found after secondary search -- {query_used}
Required when: any citation cell was unknown at first pass and required a follow-up search
Unacceptable: performing a secondary search without writing RECOVERY NOTE:; RECOVERY NOTE: missing any of the three fields; blank cells, "n/a", "unknown", "Author et al.", "[title]", or "TBD" without a RECOVERY NOTE:

**OBLIGATION B -- Empty-Tier Acknowledgment**
Every tier of the four-tier literature map must produce output. If a tier has no qualifying entries, output a `TIER EMPTY:` token using the schema below. This schema is authoritative -- the field names defined here govern what Phase 3 must produce.

Token:    TIER EMPTY:
Schema:   TIER EMPTY: {tier_name} -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}
Fields:
  tier_name                     -- one of: FOUNDATIONAL | RECENT | CONTRARY | METHODOLOGICAL
  why_no_sources_qualified      -- one sentence explaining why the tier has no entries
  search_that_would_address_gap -- one concrete WebSearch query or strategy
Required when: any tier produces zero qualifying source entries
Unacceptable: tier heading with no entries and no TIER EMPTY: token; TIER EMPTY: with fewer than three fields

Both obligations apply before Phase 1 begins and remain in force through Phase 5. Questions that include "if unknown" require you to perform the follow-up action and report the result. Questions that include "if none found" require a TIER EMPTY: token -- they cannot be answered with silence.

---

## PHASE 1 -- What are the claims that need support?

1. What are the 3-5 key claims this work makes about {{topic}} that require literature support?
2. For each claim: what kind of evidence would confirm it? (empirical study / theoretical argument / methodological precedent)
3. For each claim: what would a skeptic cite to challenge it?

Read any prior signals (discover-hypothesis, specify-spec, paper draft) before answering.

### INERTIA COMMITMENT (required gate before Phase 2 begins)

Before searching a single paper, commit to what inertia looks like for this topic. Phase 4 will measure the evidence gathered against this commitment.

Answer: what would a team do if they ignored this literature entirely?
Name the default path -- the behavior that requires no effort.

INERTIA SCENARIO: [the default team behavior if this review is ignored -- written before any search]

Hold this scenario. Phase 4 will ask whether the literature gathered makes this default worse than acting.

At the end of Phase 1, write:
PHASE 1 COMPLETE: claims=[n] | inertia_committed=[yes] | evidence_type_mapped=[yes/no] | counter-evidence-noted=[yes/no]

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 1 / claim-extraction boundary -- every run produces PHASE 1 COMPLETE:. The inertia_committed=[yes] field confirms Phase 1 produced a pre-search inertia commitment (C-14 front-loaded; C-27 Phase-1 status field satisfied -- the C-14 inertia axis is now observable at the lifecycle token layer, meaning inertia commitment can be verified from this token alone without reading the INERTIA SCENARIO: block; C-27 in progress: Phase 1 dependency satisfied, Phase 4 verification pending). The evidence_type_mapped and counter-evidence-noted fields confirm interrogative obligation discharged per claim (C-11 PASS). Adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Token 1 of 4 required for C-23 (Phase 1 / claim-extraction boundary instrumented; C-23 in progress at 1/4). Additive: inertia_committed=[yes] coexists with N-of-4 counter, C-11 fields, and C-16 gate token without displacing any required element. C-28 attestation at Phase 1 boundary: this token satisfies C-27(a) -- the Phase 1 inertia-commitment sub-clause. The inertia_committed=[yes] field is the self-declaring signal confirming C-27(a) compliance at this boundary; no cross-reference to Phase 4 is required to verify C-27(a) here. Single-grep verifiable: grep for PHASE 1 COMPLETE: and read inertia_committed field to confirm C-27(a) satisfied at this boundary. C-28 PASS at Phase 1 boundary.

---

## PHASE 2 -- What does the literature actually say?

Target: reach the source threshold for {{mode}} mode (quick >= 5, standard >= 15, deep >= 25).

For each claim from Phase 1, search and answer:

1. What seminal papers does the field cite on this claim? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] seminal paper")
2. What systematic reviews from 2020-2025 map the current state? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] review 2020-2025")
3. What papers directly challenge or contradict this claim? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] criticism" or "against [claim]")
4. What papers establish the methodological precedent for this work? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] method")

If threshold not met after four angles:
5. WebSearch: "[related concept] [claim topic]"
6. WebSearch: "[found paper title] cited by"

Continue until threshold is met or all angles exhausted. If threshold cannot be met, note:
THRESHOLD NOT MET: found [n] of [threshold] sources -- search angles exhausted: [list]

This token serves dual purpose: records threshold shortfall without YAML parsing (C-09 PASS) and adds a named gate token alongside INERTIA SCENARIO: and INERTIA RISK: (C-16 PASS). This is Pair 1, Token A. C-09 PASS, C-16 PASS.

For each source, answer per-source questions before entering in table. For any unknown cell: "not found after secondary search -- [query used]".

| Title | Authors | Year | Venue | Claim # | Position | Key finding |
|-------|---------|------|-------|---------|----------|-------------|

For any cell requiring secondary search:
RECOVERY NOTE: {field_name} for "{title_fragment}" -- {outcome}

This token serves dual purpose: makes recovery step body-visible and auditable (C-12 PASS) and adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Pair 1 summary: THRESHOLD NOT MET: covers C-09 + C-16; RECOVERY NOTE: covers C-12 + C-16; together: C-09, C-12, C-16. C-20 PASS for Pair 1 independently.

Every cell must contain real data or "not found after secondary search -- [query used]". (OBLIGATION A)

At the end of Phase 2, write:
PHASE 2 COMPLETE: sources=[n] | threshold=[threshold] | status=[MET | NOT MET: [n]/[threshold]]

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 2 / evidence-gathering boundary. Adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Token 2 of 4 required for C-23 (Phase 2 / evidence-gathering boundary instrumented; C-23 in progress at 2/4). First of two required unconditional lifecycle tokens for C-22 (C-22 in progress). This is Pair 2, Token A. C-09 PASS, C-16 PASS.

---

## PHASE 3 -- How does the literature organize?

Answer both questions for each tier. (OBLIGATION B governs all four tiers.)

### FOUNDATIONAL tier

Q: Which sources are foundational?
TIER ENTRY: FOUNDATIONAL -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- [one-sentence justification]
Q: If none found: TIER EMPTY: FOUNDATIONAL -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}

### RECENT tier (2020 or later)

Q: Which sources are recent (2020+)?
TIER ENTRY: RECENT -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- [note on current consensus or shift]
Q: If none found: TIER EMPTY: RECENT -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}

### CONTRARY tier

Q: Which sources are contrary?
TIER ENTRY: CONTRARY -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- Claim # [n] -- [specific objection in one sentence]
Q: If none found: TIER EMPTY: CONTRARY -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}

### METHODOLOGICAL tier

Q: Which sources establish methodological precedent?
TIER ENTRY: METHODOLOGICAL -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- [year confirmation: predates current work]
Q: If none found: TIER EMPTY: METHODOLOGICAL -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}

At the end of Phase 3, write:
PHASE 3 COMPLETE: tiers_populated=[n/4] | tiers_empty=[n] | tiers_empty_acknowledged=[yes/no]

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 3 / literature-mapping boundary. The tiers_empty_acknowledged field confirms TIER EMPTY: coverage (C-13 PASS). Adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Token 3 of 4 required for C-23 (Phase 3 / literature-mapping boundary instrumented; C-23 in progress at 3/4). Second of two required unconditional lifecycle tokens -- C-22 fully satisfied. This is Pair 2, Token B. Pair 2 summary: PHASE 2 COMPLETE: covers C-09 + C-16; PHASE 3 COMPLETE: covers C-13 + C-16; together: C-09, C-13, C-16. C-20 PASS for Pair 2 independently.

C-24 Independence Verification

Pair 1 -- failure/recovery axis: THRESHOLD NOT MET: (C-09+C-16) + RECOVERY NOTE: (C-12+C-16). Pair 1: C-09, C-12, C-16. C-20 PASS for Pair 1 independently.
Pair 2 -- lifecycle axis: PHASE 2 COMPLETE: (C-09+C-16) + PHASE 3 COMPLETE: (C-13+C-16). Pair 2: C-09, C-13, C-16. C-20 PASS for Pair 2 independently.
Remove-either-pair test: Removing Pair 1: Pair 2 alone -- C-20 PASS. Removing Pair 2: Pair 1 alone -- C-20 PASS.
Four tokens total, all distinct. C-24 PASS.

## PHASE 4 -- Where are the gaps and what should be done?

1. How many claims have strong literature support (>= 2 sources)? Which ones?
2. How many claims have weak or no support? Which ones?
3. Which contrary papers pose the greatest threat? List most-dangerous-first.
4. Are any claims HIGH RISK? For each: scope / qualify / drop?
5. What is the overall strength of the evidence position?

Claims with strong support: N/M
Claims with weak or no support: [list]
Contrary evidence to address: [list -- most dangerous first]
HIGH RISK claims: [list or "none"]
  For each HIGH RISK: scope / qualify / drop + one-sentence framing

### Inertia verification (required gate before the recommendation keyword)

Return to the INERTIA SCENARIO committed in Phase 1. Measure the evidence gathered against it.

Q: Does the literature make the inertia default worse than acting on this evidence?

INERTIA SCENARIO: [repeat your Phase 1 commitment -- unchanged]
INERTIA RISK: [why the evidence gathered makes that default worse than acting]
RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED / SEARCH MORE / REFRAME CLAIM
Reason: [one sentence -- must name what in the evidence counters the Phase 1 inertia scenario]

At the end of Phase 4, write:
PHASE 4 COMPLETE: recommendation=[PROCEED | SEARCH MORE | REFRAME CLAIM] | inertia_verified=[yes] | high_risk_claims=[n]

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 4 / gap-analysis boundary -- every run produces PHASE 4 COMPLETE:. The inertia_verified=[yes] field confirms Phase 4 returned to the Phase 1 commitment (C-14 PASS). C-27 PASS: cross-axis integration complete -- PHASE 1 COMPLETE: carries inertia_committed=[yes] and PHASE 4 COMPLETE: carries inertia_verified=[yes]. The inertia_verified=[yes] field coexists with N-of-4 counter and C-14/C-16 content without displacing any required element. Adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Token 4 of 4 required for C-23. C-23 fully satisfied. C-28 PASS at Phase 4 boundary: C-27 compliance explicitly declared here -- inertia_verified=[yes] at this token makes the Phase 4 inertia verification verifiable from this token alone without cross-referencing Phase 1.

---

## PHASE 5 -- What are the three most important next actions?

1. Which claim most urgently needs more support, and what should be searched for next?
2. Which contrary paper must be directly addressed, and what should the response strategy be?
3. What methodological precedent is missing and where might it be found?

Write artifact to: signals/discover/literature/{{topic}}-literature-{{date}}.md

## V-04 -- C-29 Phase-4-Only Test

**Axis**: Single-axis C-29 both-boundary test (Phase 4 full C-29; Phase 1 C-28 only)
**Hypothesis**: C-29 requires both boundaries. Full operationalization at Phase 4 only (sub-clause C-27(b) + self-declaring signal + grep) while Phase 1 retains R11 V-01 C-28 level. Expected: C-29 FAIL = 190/195. Symmetric counterpart to V-03.

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 1 / claim-extraction boundary -- every run produces PHASE 1 COMPLETE:. The inertia_committed=[yes] field confirms Phase 1 produced a pre-search inertia commitment (C-14 front-loaded; C-27 Phase-1 status field satisfied -- the C-14 inertia axis is now observable at the lifecycle token layer, meaning inertia commitment can be verified from this token alone without reading the INERTIA SCENARIO: block; C-27 in progress: Phase 1 dependency satisfied, Phase 4 verification pending).

---

## PHASE 2 -- What does the literature actually say?

Target: reach the source threshold for {{mode}} mode (quick >= 5, standard >= 15, deep >= 25).

For each claim from Phase 1, search and answer:

1. What seminal papers does the field cite on this claim? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] seminal paper")

This token serves dual purpose: makes recovery step body-visible and auditable (C-12 PASS) and adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Pair 1 summary: THRESHOLD NOT MET: covers C-09 + C-16; RECOVERY NOTE: covers C-12 + C-16; together: C-09, C-12, C-16. C-20 PASS for Pair 1 independently.

Every cell must contain real data or "not found after secondary search -- [query used]". (OBLIGATION A)

At the end of Phase 2, write:
PHASE 2 COMPLETE: sources=[n] | threshold=[threshold] | status=[MET | NOT MET: [n]/[threshold]]

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 2 / evidence-gathering boundary. Adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Token 2 of 4 required for C-23 (Phase 2 / evidence-gathering boundary instrumented; C-23 in progress at 2/4). First of two required unconditional lifecycle tokens for C-22 (C-22 in progress). This is Pair 2, Token A. C-09 PASS, C-16 PASS.

## PHASE 3 -- How does the literature organize?

Answer both questions for each tier. (OBLIGATION B governs all four tiers.)

### FOUNDATIONAL tier

Q: Which sources are foundational?

### METHODOLOGICAL tier

Q: Which sources establish methodological precedent?
TIER ENTRY: METHODOLOGICAL -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- [year confirmation: predates current work]
Q: If none found: TIER EMPTY: METHODOLOGICAL -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}

At the end of Phase 3, write:
PHASE 3 COMPLETE: tiers_populated=[n/4] | tiers_empty=[n] | tiers_empty_acknowledged=[yes/no]

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 3 / literature-mapping boundary. The tiers_empty_acknowledged field confirms TIER EMPTY: coverage (C-13 PASS). Adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Token 3 of 4 required for C-23 (Phase 3 / literature-mapping boundary instrumented; C-23 in progress at 3/4). Second of two required unconditional lifecycle tokens -- C-22 fully satisfied. This is Pair 2, Token B. Pair 2 summary: PHASE 2 COMPLETE: covers C-09 + C-16; PHASE 3 COMPLETE: covers C-13 + C-16; together: C-09, C-13, C-16. C-20 PASS for Pair 2 independently.

Pair 1 -- failure/recovery axis: THRESHOLD NOT MET: (C-09+C-16) + RECOVERY NOTE: (C-12+C-16). Pair 1: C-09, C-12, C-16. C-20 PASS for Pair 1 independently.
Pair 2 -- lifecycle axis: PHASE 2 COMPLETE: (C-09+C-16) + PHASE 3 COMPLETE: (C-13+C-16). Pair 2: C-09, C-13, C-16. C-20 PASS for Pair 2 independently.
Remove-either-pair test: Removing Pair 1: Pair 2 alone -- C-20 PASS. Removing Pair 2: Pair 1 alone -- C-20 PASS.
Four tokens total, all distinct. C-24 PASS.

## PHASE 4 -- Where are the gaps and what should be done?

1. How many claims have strong literature support (>= 2 sources)? Which ones?
2. How many claims have weak or no support? Which ones?
3. Which contrary papers pose the greatest threat? List most-dangerous-first.
4. Are any claims HIGH RISK? For each: scope / qualify / drop?
5. What is the overall strength of the evidence position?

Claims with strong support: N/M
Claims with weak or no support: [list]
Contrary evidence to address: [list -- most dangerous first]
HIGH RISK claims: [list or "none"]
  For each HIGH RISK: scope / qualify / drop + one-sentence framing

### Inertia verification (required gate before the recommendation keyword)

Return to the INERTIA SCENARIO committed in Phase 1. Measure the evidence gathered against it.

Q: Does the literature make the inertia default worse than acting on this evidence?

INERTIA SCENARIO: [repeat your Phase 1 commitment -- unchanged]
INERTIA RISK: [why the evidence gathered makes that default worse than acting]
RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED / SEARCH MORE / REFRAME CLAIM
Reason: [one sentence -- must name what in the evidence counters the Phase 1 inertia scenario]

At the end of Phase 4, write:
PHASE 4 COMPLETE: recommendation=[PROCEED | SEARCH MORE | REFRAME CLAIM] | inertia_verified=[yes] | high_risk_claims=[n]

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 4 / gap-analysis boundary -- every run produces PHASE 4 COMPLETE:. The inertia_verified=[yes] field confirms Phase 4 returned to the Phase 1 commitment (C-14 PASS). C-27 PASS: cross-axis integration complete -- PHASE 1 COMPLETE: carries inertia_committed=[yes] (Phase 1 boundary, C-27(a) satisfied) and PHASE 4 COMPLETE: carries inertia_verified=[yes] (Phase 4 boundary, C-27(b) satisfied). The inertia_verified=[yes] field coexists with N-of-4 counter and C-14/C-16 content without displacing any required element -- additive design property confirmed. Adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Token 4 of 4 required for C-23. C-23 fully satisfied. All four phase boundaries instrumented. C-28 attestation at Phase 4 boundary: this token satisfies C-27(b) -- the Phase 4 inertia-verification sub-clause. The inertia_verified=[yes] field is the self-declaring signal confirming C-27(b) compliance at this boundary; no cross-reference to Phase 1 is required to verify C-27(b) here. Single-grep verifiable: grep for PHASE 4 COMPLETE: and read inertia_verified field to confirm C-27(b) satisfied at this boundary. C-27 PASS: full cross-axis integration complete. C-28 PASS at Phase 4 boundary.

---

## PHASE 5 -- What are the three most important next actions?

1. Which claim most urgently needs more support, and what should be searched for next?
2. Which contrary paper must be directly addressed, and what should the response strategy be?
3. What methodological precedent is missing and where might it be found?

Write artifact to: signals/discover/literature/{{topic}}-literature-{{date}}.md
Include frontmatter: skill: discover-literature, topic: {{topic}}, date: {{date}}, mode: {{mode}}, claims_checked: [n], sources_found: [n], high_risk_claims: [n]

## V-05 -- v12 Ceiling Synthesis (All 29 Criteria)

**Axes**: All 29 criteria combined -- full C-29 operationalization at both Phase 1 and Phase 4 boundaries. Each boundary carries: (1) explicit C-27 sub-clause designation (C-27(a) at Phase 1, C-27(b) at Phase 4), (2) identification of the self-declaring signal field by name, and (3) embedded grep instruction. Explicit C-29 PASS declared at each boundary.
**Hypothesis**: All three C-29 elements present at both boundaries satisfies C-29. All 29 criteria PASS. Score: 195/195.

```
You are running /discover-literature for: {{topic}}
Depth mode: {{mode | default: standard}}

Depth mode source thresholds:
- quick: >= 5 distinct sources
- standard: >= 15 distinct sources
- deep: >= 25 distinct sources

You must reach the source threshold for the active depth mode before advancing to Phase 3.

---

## ENFORCEMENT CONTRACT (applies to every phase below)

Two obligations govern this entire run. Both are non-optional. Neither can be waived by phase, by brevity, or by the difficulty of the topic.

**OBLIGATION A -- Anti-Placeholder Recovery**
Every citation cell must contain real data or an explicit recovery note. If a cell is unknown at first pass, perform a follow-up search. If the follow-up search also fails, record it using the schema below. This schema is authoritative -- the field names defined here govern what Phase 2 must produce for any recovery event.

Token:    RECOVERY NOTE:
Schema:   RECOVERY NOTE: {field_name} for "{title_fragment}" -- {outcome}
Fields:
  field_name      -- the citation column requiring secondary search (Title | Authors | Year | Venue | Key finding)
  title_fragment  -- a short identifying fragment of the source title
  outcome         -- one of: filled -- {data_found} | not found after secondary search -- {query_used}
Required when: any citation cell was unknown at first pass and required a follow-up search
Unacceptable: performing a secondary search without writing RECOVERY NOTE:; RECOVERY NOTE: missing any of the three fields; blank cells, "n/a", "unknown", "Author et al.", "[title]", or "TBD" without a RECOVERY NOTE:

**OBLIGATION B -- Empty-Tier Acknowledgment**
Every tier of the four-tier literature map must produce output. If a tier has no qualifying entries, output a `TIER EMPTY:` token using the schema below. This schema is authoritative -- the field names defined here govern what Phase 3 must produce.

Token:    TIER EMPTY:
Schema:   TIER EMPTY: {tier_name} -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}
Fields:
  tier_name                     -- one of: FOUNDATIONAL | RECENT | CONTRARY | METHODOLOGICAL
  why_no_sources_qualified      -- one sentence explaining why the tier has no entries
  search_that_would_address_gap -- one concrete WebSearch query or strategy
Required when: any tier produces zero qualifying source entries
Unacceptable: tier heading with no entries and no TIER EMPTY: token; TIER EMPTY: with fewer than three fields

Both obligations apply before Phase 1 begins and remain in force through Phase 5. Questions that include "if unknown" require you to perform the follow-up action and report the result. Questions that include "if none found" require a TIER EMPTY: token -- they cannot be answered with silence.

---

## PHASE 1 -- What are the claims that need support?

1. What are the 3-5 key claims this work makes about {{topic}} that require literature support?
2. For each claim: what kind of evidence would confirm it? (empirical study / theoretical argument / methodological precedent)
3. For each claim: what would a skeptic cite to challenge it?

Read any prior signals (discover-hypothesis, specify-spec, paper draft) before answering.

### INERTIA COMMITMENT (required gate before Phase 2 begins)

Before searching a single paper, commit to what inertia looks like for this topic. Phase 4 will measure the evidence gathered against this commitment.

Answer: what would a team do if they ignored this literature entirely?
Name the default path -- the behavior that requires no effort.

INERTIA SCENARIO: [the default team behavior if this review is ignored -- written before any search]

Hold this scenario. Phase 4 will ask whether the literature gathered makes this default worse than acting.

At the end of Phase 1, write:
PHASE 1 COMPLETE: claims=[n] | inertia_committed=[yes] | evidence_type_mapped=[yes/no] | counter-evidence-noted=[yes/no]

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 1 / claim-extraction boundary -- every run produces PHASE 1 COMPLETE:. The inertia_committed=[yes] field confirms Phase 1 produced a pre-search inertia commitment (C-14 front-loaded; C-27 Phase-1 status field satisfied -- the C-14 inertia axis is now observable at the lifecycle token layer, meaning inertia commitment can be verified from this token alone without reading the INERTIA SCENARIO: block; C-27 in progress: Phase 1 dependency satisfied, Phase 4 verification pending). The evidence_type_mapped and counter-evidence-noted fields confirm interrogative obligation discharged per claim (C-11 PASS). Adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Token 1 of 4 required for C-23 (Phase 1 / claim-extraction boundary instrumented; C-23 in progress at 1/4). Additive: inertia_committed=[yes] coexists with N-of-4 counter, C-11 fields, and C-16 gate token without displacing any required element. C-28 attestation at Phase 1 boundary: this token satisfies C-27(a) -- the Phase 1 inertia-commitment sub-clause. The inertia_committed=[yes] field is the self-declaring signal confirming C-27(a) compliance at this boundary; no cross-reference to Phase 4 is required to verify C-27(a) here. Single-grep verifiable: grep for PHASE 1 COMPLETE: and read inertia_committed field to confirm C-27(a) satisfied at this boundary. C-28 PASS at Phase 1 boundary. C-29 PASS at Phase 1 boundary: C-27(a) sub-clause identified, self-declaring signal identified (inertia_committed=[yes] field), grep instruction embedded.

---

## PHASE 2 -- What does the literature actually say?

Target: reach the source threshold for {{mode}} mode (quick >= 5, standard >= 15, deep >= 25).

For each claim from Phase 1, search and answer:

1. What seminal papers does the field cite on this claim? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] seminal paper")
2. What systematic reviews from 2020-2025 map the current state? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] review 2020-2025")
3. What papers directly challenge or contradict this claim? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] criticism" or "against [claim]")
4. What papers establish the methodological precedent for this work? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] method")

If threshold not met after four angles:
5. WebSearch: "[related concept] [claim topic]"
6. WebSearch: "[found paper title] cited by"

Continue until threshold is met or all angles exhausted. If threshold cannot be met, note:
THRESHOLD NOT MET: found [n] of [threshold] sources -- search angles exhausted: [list]

This token serves dual purpose: records threshold shortfall without YAML parsing (C-09 PASS) and adds a named gate token alongside INERTIA SCENARIO: and INERTIA RISK: (C-16 PASS). This is Pair 1, Token A. C-09 PASS, C-16 PASS.

For each source, answer per-source questions before entering in table. For any unknown cell: "not found after secondary search -- [query used]".

| Title | Authors | Year | Venue | Claim # | Position | Key finding |
|-------|---------|------|-------|---------|----------|-------------|

For any cell requiring secondary search:
RECOVERY NOTE: {field_name} for "{title_fragment}" -- {outcome}

This token serves dual purpose: makes recovery step body-visible and auditable (C-12 PASS) and adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Pair 1 summary: THRESHOLD NOT MET: covers C-09 + C-16; RECOVERY NOTE: covers C-12 + C-16; together: C-09, C-12, C-16. C-20 PASS for Pair 1 independently.

Every cell must contain real data or "not found after secondary search -- [query used]". (OBLIGATION A)

At the end of Phase 2, write:
PHASE 2 COMPLETE: sources=[n] | threshold=[threshold] | status=[MET | NOT MET: [n]/[threshold]]

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 2 / evidence-gathering boundary -- every run produces PHASE 2 COMPLETE:, whether threshold met or not; only the status field differs. This is the decisive observability upgrade over THRESHOLD NOT MET:: a run meeting its threshold still produces PHASE 2 COMPLETE: with status=MET, making compliance verifiable in every outcome (C-09 PASS). Adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Token 2 of 4 required for C-23 (Phase 2 / evidence-gathering boundary instrumented; C-23 in progress at 2/4). First of two required unconditional lifecycle tokens for C-22 (C-22 in progress). This is Pair 2, Token A. C-22 is orthogonal to the inertia front-loading axis. C-09 PASS, C-16 PASS.

---

## PHASE 3 -- How does the literature organize?

Answer both questions for each tier. (OBLIGATION B governs all four tiers.)

### FOUNDATIONAL tier

Q: Which sources are foundational?
TIER ENTRY: FOUNDATIONAL -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- [one-sentence justification]
Q: If none found: TIER EMPTY: FOUNDATIONAL -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}

### RECENT tier (2020 or later)

Q: Which sources are recent (2020+)?
TIER ENTRY: RECENT -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- [note on current consensus or shift]
Q: If none found: TIER EMPTY: RECENT -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}

### CONTRARY tier

Q: Which sources are contrary?
TIER ENTRY: CONTRARY -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- Claim # [n] -- [specific objection in one sentence]
Q: If none found: TIER EMPTY: CONTRARY -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}

### METHODOLOGICAL tier

Q: Which sources establish methodological precedent?
TIER ENTRY: METHODOLOGICAL -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- [year confirmation: predates current work]
Q: If none found: TIER EMPTY: METHODOLOGICAL -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}

At the end of Phase 3, write:
PHASE 3 COMPLETE: tiers_populated=[n/4] | tiers_empty=[n] | tiers_empty_acknowledged=[yes/no]

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 3 / literature-mapping boundary. The tiers_empty_acknowledged field confirms TIER EMPTY: coverage (C-13 PASS). Adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Token 3 of 4 required for C-23 (Phase 3 / literature-mapping boundary instrumented; C-23 in progress at 3/4). Second of two required unconditional lifecycle tokens -- C-22 fully satisfied (Phase 2 + Phase 3 boundaries both instrumented unconditionally; C-22 PASS). This is Pair 2, Token B -- lifecycle pair complete. Pair 2 summary: PHASE 2 COMPLETE: covers C-09 + C-16; PHASE 3 COMPLETE: covers C-13 + C-16; together: C-09, C-13, C-16 -- three distinct aspirational criteria. C-09 PASS, C-13 PASS, C-16 PASS. C-20 PASS for Pair 2 independently.

C-24 Independence Verification

Pair 1 -- failure/recovery axis:
- THRESHOLD NOT MET: -- covers C-09 (threshold shortfall body-visible without YAML parsing) + C-16 (named gate token). C-09 PASS, C-16 PASS.
- RECOVERY NOTE: -- covers C-12 (recovery step body-visible and auditable) + C-16 (named gate token). C-12 PASS, C-16 PASS.
- Pair 1 together: C-09, C-12, C-16 -- three distinct aspirational criteria. Both tokens named. Both carry PASS annotations. C-20 PASS for Pair 1 independently.

Pair 2 -- lifecycle axis:
- PHASE 2 COMPLETE: -- covers C-09 (threshold verifiable unconditionally at Phase 2 boundary) + C-16 (named gate token). C-09 PASS, C-16 PASS.
- PHASE 3 COMPLETE: -- covers C-13 (empty-tier verifiable unconditionally at Phase 3 boundary) + C-16 (named gate token). C-13 PASS, C-16 PASS.
- Pair 2 together: C-09, C-13, C-16 -- three distinct aspirational criteria. Both tokens named. Both carry PASS annotations. C-20 PASS for Pair 2 independently.

Remove-either-pair test:
- Removing Pair 1: Pair 2 alone covers C-09, C-13, C-16 -- three distinct criteria, two annotated tokens. C-20 PASS.
- Removing Pair 2: Pair 1 alone covers C-09, C-12, C-16 -- three distinct criteria, two annotated tokens. C-20 PASS.

Four tokens total, all distinct. Neither pair depends on the other for C-20 compliance. C-24 PASS.

## PHASE 4 -- Where are the gaps and what should be done?

1. How many claims have strong literature support (>= 2 sources)? Which ones?
2. How many claims have weak or no support? Which ones?
3. Which contrary papers pose the greatest threat? List most-dangerous-first.
4. Are any claims HIGH RISK? For each: scope / qualify / drop?
5. What is the overall strength of the evidence position?

Claims with strong support: N/M
Claims with weak or no support: [list]
Contrary evidence to address: [list -- most dangerous first]
HIGH RISK claims: [list or "none"]
  For each HIGH RISK: scope / qualify / drop + one-sentence framing

### Inertia verification (required gate before the recommendation keyword)

Return to the INERTIA SCENARIO committed in Phase 1. Measure the evidence gathered against it.

Q: Does the literature make the inertia default worse than acting on this evidence?
Name the specific risk the inertia path creates given what you now know. If recommending PROCEED: show why the evidence is strong enough to overcome inertia. If SEARCH MORE or REFRAME CLAIM: name what inertia leaves exposed.

INERTIA SCENARIO: [repeat your Phase 1 commitment -- unchanged]
INERTIA RISK: [why the evidence gathered makes that default worse than acting]
RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED / SEARCH MORE / REFRAME CLAIM
Reason: [one sentence -- must name what in the evidence counters the Phase 1 inertia scenario]

At the end of Phase 4, write:
PHASE 4 COMPLETE: recommendation=[PROCEED | SEARCH MORE | REFRAME CLAIM] | inertia_verified=[yes] | high_risk_claims=[n]

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 4 / gap-analysis boundary -- every run produces PHASE 4 COMPLETE:. The inertia_verified=[yes] field confirms Phase 4 returned to the Phase 1 commitment and verified evidence against it (C-14 PASS: inertia front-loaded in Phase 1, verified in Phase 4 -- maximum C-14 coverage). C-27 PASS: cross-axis integration complete -- PHASE 1 COMPLETE: carries inertia_committed=[yes] (Phase 1 boundary, C-27(a) satisfied) and PHASE 4 COMPLETE: carries inertia_verified=[yes] (Phase 4 boundary, C-27(b) satisfied). Inertia compliance is now verifiable at the lifecycle token layer from either token independently without reading dedicated INERTIA SCENARIO:/INERTIA RISK: blocks. The inertia_verified=[yes] field coexists with the N-of-4 counter and C-14/C-16 content without displacing any required element -- additive design property confirmed. Adds a named gate token (C-16 PASS). Token 4 of 4 required for C-23 (Phase 4 / gap-analysis boundary instrumented). C-23 fully satisfied. All four phase boundaries instrumented with unconditional lifecycle tokens: Phase 1 / claim-extraction (1/4), Phase 2 / evidence-gathering (2/4), Phase 3 / literature-mapping (3/4), Phase 4 / gap-analysis (4/4). Each token names its phase boundary and confirms unconditional emission. C-23 PASS. C-28 attestation at Phase 4 boundary: this token satisfies C-27(b) -- the Phase 4 inertia-verification sub-clause. The inertia_verified=[yes] field is the self-declaring signal confirming C-27(b) compliance at this boundary; no cross-reference to Phase 1 is required to verify C-27(b) here. Single-grep verifiable: grep for PHASE 4 COMPLETE: and read inertia_verified field to confirm C-27(b) satisfied at this boundary. C-27 PASS: full cross-axis integration complete. C-28 PASS at Phase 4 boundary. C-29 PASS at Phase 4 boundary: C-27(b) sub-clause identified, self-declaring signal identified (inertia_verified=[yes] field), grep instruction embedded. C-29 fully satisfied at both Phase 1 and Phase 4 boundaries: C-29(a) confirmed at PHASE 1 COMPLETE:, C-29(b) confirmed here. Dependency chain C-14 + C-23 -> C-27 -> C-28 -> C-29 complete.

## PHASE 5 -- What are the three most important next actions?

1. Which claim most urgently needs more support, and what should be searched for next?
2. Which contrary paper must be directly addressed, and what should the response strategy be?
3. What methodological precedent is missing and where might it be found?
