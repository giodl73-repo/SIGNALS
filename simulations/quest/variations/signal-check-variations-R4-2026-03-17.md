**R4 Summary**

**Axis matrix**:

| V | C-43 | C-44 | C-45 | Expected |
|---|------|------|------|----------|
| V-01 | PASS | FAIL | FAIL | 35/37 → 99.46 |
| V-02 | FAIL | PASS | FAIL | 34/37 → 99.19 |
| V-03 | FAIL | FAIL | PASS | 34/37 → 99.19 |
| V-04 | PASS | PASS | PASS | 37/37 → 100.0 |
| V-05 | PASS | PASS | PASS | 37/37 → 100.0 |

**Key structural changes from R3 V-05 baseline**:

1. **C-43 differentiator** — STEP D annotation form. PASS: 5 independently self-standing per-input annotations. FAIL: single grouped annotation (`Required inputs -- do not re-derive [...]:`), which also entails C-28 FAIL at that step — hence V-02/V-03 score 34/37 rather than 35/37.

2. **C-44 differentiator** — terminal verdict line in STEP E. PASS: `Terminal readiness: [...] -> topic namespace` (arrow inline on verdict). FAIL: arrow on a separate following line as a consumer-side back-reference. C-41 (ARCHITECTURE table) remains PASS in all variations — isolating C-44 as a production-site annotation requirement distinct from the table entry.

3. **C-45 differentiator** — ARCHITECTURE meta-rule. PASS: names parseable completeness / independence as the positive standard. FAIL: names only the prohibition ("not grouped"). V-05 tests an alternative phrasing ("parseable in isolation — no shared header, no proximity reliance") to check whether the positive standard can be stated differently while still satisfying C-45.

**Score asymmetry**: V-01 (35/37, 99.46) scores higher than V-02/V-03 (34/37, 99.19) because the C-43 degradation at STEP D entails C-28 co-failure — one structural choice at a grouped intermediate step fails two criteria. This is exactly the cluster property C-43 documents: it's one root failure, but two criterion counts.
ve standard.

**Locked structural additions over R3 V-05** (applied to all C-43/PASS variations):
- STEP D per-input annotations are each explicitly labelled with their source step, making each annotation independently parseable. This is the C-43 compliance marker at the pipeline's highest-fan-in consuming step.
- C-44 PASS form: the terminal verdict line is `Terminal readiness: [label + reason] -> topic namespace` — the arrow appears inline on the verdict line, not on a following consumer-side instruction line.
- C-45 PASS form: the ARCHITECTURE meta-rule reads: "Each consuming step with N named inputs carries N independently self-standing per-input prohibitions — each annotation parseable as a complete statement without relying on proximity to other annotations (independence standard; not merely non-grouping)."

**Research questions**:
1. Does preserving independent per-input annotations at all intermediate multi-input steps (STEP 3, STEP C per-dim, STEP D) constitute C-43 compliance, while a grouped annotation at STEP D constitutes C-43 failure that entails C-28 co-failure? (V-01 vs V-02/V-03)
2. Does the inline forward-declaration arrow on the terminal verdict line (`Terminal readiness: [...] -> topic namespace`) satisfy C-44 as a structurally distinct requirement from C-41 (ARCHITECTURE table) and from the following-line consumer back-reference notation? (V-02 vs V-01/V-03)
3. Does explicitly naming independence (parseable completeness) as the positive standard in the ARCHITECTURE meta-rule — rather than only prohibiting grouping — constitute C-45 compliance? (V-03 vs V-01/V-02)
4. Do all three together (V-04) close the remaining aspirational gaps in R3 V-05 at zero structural overhead — achieving 37/37? (V-04 vs R3 V-05 baseline)
5. Does an alternative phrasing of the independence standard in the meta-rule (V-05) still satisfy C-45 when the core property (parseable completeness without proximity dependency) is preserved? (V-05 vs V-04)

## V-01 — Single Axis: C-43 (Pipeline-Wide Independence at All Multi-Input Consuming Steps)

**Axes**: C-43 PASS (all multi-input consuming steps — STEP 3, STEP C per-dim, STEP D, STEP E — use independently self-standing per-input annotations). C-44 FAIL by design (terminal verdict uses separate-line arrow, not inline). C-45 FAIL by design (meta-rule says "not grouped" without naming independence as positive standard).
**Hypothesis**: C-36's independence requirement, which R3 V-05 explicitly satisfied only at STEP E, must hold at every multi-input consuming step in the pipeline for C-43 to pass. V-01 confirms that STEP D's 5-input form and STEP C per-dim's 2-input form already satisfy the independence standard structurally — each annotation is a complete standalone statement without proximity dependency. The critical differentiator is that C-44 and C-45 are intentionally degraded: the terminal verdict carries no inline forward arrow (C-44 FAIL), and the meta-rule names only the prohibition ("not grouped") without the positive standard (C-45 FAIL). This isolates C-43's contribution — confirming that the pipeline-wide independence property can be satisfied structurally at intermediate steps while C-44 and C-45 remain unsatisfied.

Two parts in order. Do not merge.
PART 1 -- ANALYTICAL RECORD: internal. Severity, mechanism analysis, ranked flags.
PART 2 -- TEAM COACHING REPORT: advisory observations. No severity labels or scores.

Locked structural features (architectural -- not instructional):
1. Artifact inventory includes "Inertia Relevant?" column (yes / no per artifact).
2. CAUSAL GAP opens with "Inertia-relevant pool: [list]" and evaluates that pool only.
   Empty pool -> verdict absent by default; name what's needed.
   Non-empty pool -> evaluate; state present / partial / absent.
3. CAUSAL GAP ends with [MECHANISM VERDICT: ...]. SEQUENCE quotes it verbatim.
4. SEQUENCE closes with: Pre-specification gap: [YES / NO + reason].
5. PART 2 opens with STEP A: INERTIA CASE STRENGTH as a dedicated named section. STEP A
   opens by quoting the MECHANISM VERDICT verbatim and closes with:
   Inertia case: [BUILT / PARTIAL / OPEN + reason] -> STEP E (forward arrow).
6. COHERENCE closes with: Mechanism-relevant contradiction: [YES / NO + reason].
7. STALENESS closes with: Mechanism-stale: [YES / NO + reason].
8. STEP 3 closes with: Root pattern: [SHORT NAME].
9. PART 2 STEP C each dimension closes with STEP C drift: CLOSED/OPEN. PART 2 STEP D
   opens by consuming all five named inputs by label -- one independent per-input annotation
   each (C-43 PASS: pipeline-wide independence at this 5-input convergence step).
10. PART 2 STEP D closes with:
    Confirmed readiness: [READY / CONDITIONALLY READY / NOT READY] -> STEP E (forward arrow).
11. PART 2 STEP E opens with two independent per-input prohibitions (C-36 PASS; C-43 PASS):

    Required input -- do not re-derive: Inertia case from STEP A
    Each annotation is a complete standalone statement.

PART 1 -- ANALYTICAL RECORD  (internal -- not for team use)
======================================================================

==== STEP 0: INERTIA ANCHOR  (~30 words) ====

Before the inventory: what is the team doing today if {{topic}} does not ship?
State the status-quo alternative in one sentence. This is the inertia competitor.

==== STEP 1: ARTIFACT INVENTORY  (~150 words) ====

| Artifact | Namespace | Date | Signal Carried | Inertia Relevant? |
|----------|-----------|------|----------------|-------------------|
(Inertia Relevant: does this artifact speak to the comparison between {{topic}} and
the status-quo alternative -- competitors, benchmarks, usage data, mechanism evidence?
Mark yes / no.)

Empty namespaces (scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic):
  list each -- expected gap or meaningful blind spot?

Inertia-relevant artifact count (from column above):
  1 or more -> staleness threshold = 14 days
  0         -> staleness threshold = 30 days

==== STEP 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS -- CAUSAL GAP FIRST  (~540 words) ====

Analysis order: CAUSAL GAP -> SEQUENCE -> COHERENCE -> STALENESS.
For each: cite artifacts by name, severity internally (not a gate), coaching
observation, one concrete next action if flagged.

### CAUSAL GAP

Inertia-relevant pool: [list every artifact tagged yes in Step 1].
Evaluate mechanism evidence from this pool only.

Inertia anchor: [restate Step 0 in one phrase].

If pool is EMPTY:
  Mechanism verdict is absent by default. State explicitly. Name what artifact types
  would populate the pool. Do not draw on non-pool artifacts.

If pool is NON-EMPTY:
  Is there evidence for the pathway from {{topic}} to its claimed outcome, specifically
  better than the status-quo alternative? State: present / partial / absent.

(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

[MECHANISM VERDICT: present / partial / absent -- key gap if any: ___]
<- SEQUENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]. Quote verbatim.
<- PART 2 STEP A: Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]. Quote verbatim.

### SEQUENCE

Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]
Quoting mechanism verdict: "[MECHANISM VERDICT from above -- paste verbatim]"

Cite 2+ artifacts with dates. Did discovery precede specification?
Read ordering through mechanism lens: did inertia-relevant pool artifacts appear in
the discovery phase, or did the team specify before mechanism evidence existed?
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Pre-specification gap: [YES -- mechanism gap existed before earliest spec artifact /
  NO -- mechanism evidence was present when team committed to spec]
<- STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap. Consume by label.
<- PART 2 STEP C SEQUENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap.

### COHERENCE

Name 2+ signals on a specific claim: aligned / contradicting / inconclusive.
For each contradiction: name the two signals, state the specific disagreement, tag
whether mechanism-relevant.
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Mechanism-relevant contradiction: [YES -- name the contradiction and inertia-pool artifact /
  NO -- no contradiction involves inertia-pool signals]
<- STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction. Consume by label.
<- PART 2 STEP C COHERENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction.

### STALENESS

Apply threshold from Step 1 (14 or 30 days). Inertia-pool artifacts inside / outside window?
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Mechanism-stale: [YES -- name inertia-pool artifact(s) outside threshold /
  NO -- all inertia-pool artifacts within threshold]
<- STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale. Consume by label.
<- PART 2 STEP C STALENESS: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale.

==== STEP 3: CROSS-DIMENSION PATTERN  (~90 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap from SEQUENCE
Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction from COHERENCE
Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale from STALENESS
Pool status: [empty / thin / adequate -- from CAUSAL GAP]
[C-43 PASS: three independent per-input annotations at this 3-input consuming step]

From these named outputs:
- Pre-specification gap YES + thin/empty pool -> "Commitment before evidence"
- Mechanism-stale YES + partial verdict -> "Stale mechanism comparison"
- Mechanism-relevant contradiction YES + partial/absent verdict -> "Mechanism contradiction"
- Empty pool -> "Empty inertia pool"
- No shared root -> "Isolated flags" or "none"

Root pattern: [SHORT NAME -- drawn from named outputs; do not describe in prose only]
-> PART 2 STEP B: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern. Reference by label.
-> PART 2 STEP C per-dim: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern.
-> PART 2 STEP D: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern. Reference by label.

PART 2 -- TEAM COACHING REPORT  (advisory -- no severity labels)
======================================================================

==== STEP A: INERTIA CASE STRENGTH  (~100 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]
Quoting mechanism verdict: "[MECHANISM VERDICT from PART 1 -- paste verbatim]"

Based on that verdict and the full artifact record for {{topic}}, is the case
that it beats doing nothing:
  [ ] Clearly built -- mechanism evidence present, status-quo comparison addressed
  [ ] Partially built -- some evidence exists but specific gaps remain; name the key one
  [ ] Still open -- mechanism or comparison not established in the artifact record

State which applies. Advisory -- not a gate.

Inertia case: [BUILT / PARTIAL / OPEN + one-phrase reason]
-> STEP E: Required input -- do not re-derive: Inertia case. Consume by label.

==== STEP B: DRAFT READINESS  (~75 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3

From Part 1: which dimensions look clean, which have something worth noticing?
If Root pattern is not "none" or "Isolated flags": name the Root pattern explicitly
before individual observations -- the team sees the cross-dimension shape first.
Label: [DRAFT -- to be confirmed after STEP D and finalized in STEP E]

==== STEP C: DIMENSION OBSERVATIONS  (~340 words) ====

CAUSAL GAP-first. Advisory. No severity, scores, or gates.
Per-dimension: state Root pattern contribution and close with STEP C drift binary.

## V-02 — Single Axis: C-44 (Inline Forward-Declaration Arrow on Terminal Verdict Line)

**Axes**: C-44 PASS (terminal verdict line carries `-> topic namespace` inline: `Terminal readiness: [label + reason] -> topic namespace`). C-43 FAIL by design (STEP D uses grouped annotation — C-28 co-fails by structural entailment). C-45 FAIL by design (meta-rule says "not grouped" without naming independence as positive standard).
**Hypothesis**: C-44 requires the forward-declaration arrow to appear on the terminal verdict line itself — making the register boundary exit locally visible at the STEP E production site without requiring a reader to cross-reference the ARCHITECTURE table's C-41 Consumed-by entry. The distinction from R3 V-05's passing form is subtle: in R3 V-05, the arrow (`-> topic namespace:`) appeared on a separate following line as a consumer-side instruction, not as an inline annotation on the verdict output. C-44 PASS requires the verdict line itself to carry the arrow: `Terminal readiness: LOOP -- mechanism absent -> topic namespace`. C-43 and C-45 are intentionally degraded to isolate C-44's contribution — STEP D uses a grouped annotation (C-43 FAIL + C-28 co-fail), and the meta-rule names only the prohibition.

Two parts in order. Do not merge.
PART 1 -- ANALYTICAL RECORD: internal. Severity, mechanism analysis, ranked flags.
PART 2 -- TEAM COACHING REPORT: advisory observations. No severity labels or scores.

Locked structural features (architectural -- not instructional):
1. Artifact inventory includes "Inertia Relevant?" column (yes / no per artifact).
2. CAUSAL GAP opens with "Inertia-relevant pool: [list]" and evaluates that pool only.
   Empty pool -> verdict absent by default; name what's needed.
   Non-empty pool -> evaluate; state present / partial / absent.
3. CAUSAL GAP ends with [MECHANISM VERDICT: ...]. SEQUENCE quotes it verbatim.
4. SEQUENCE closes with: Pre-specification gap: [YES / NO + reason].
5. PART 2 opens with STEP A: INERTIA CASE STRENGTH as a dedicated named section. STEP A
   opens by quoting the MECHANISM VERDICT verbatim and closes with:
   Inertia case: [BUILT / PARTIAL / OPEN + reason] -> STEP E (forward arrow).
6. COHERENCE closes with: Mechanism-relevant contradiction: [YES / NO + reason].
7. STALENESS closes with: Mechanism-stale: [YES / NO + reason].
8. STEP 3 closes with: Root pattern: [SHORT NAME].
9. PART 2 STEP C each dimension closes with STEP C drift: CLOSED/OPEN. PART 2 STEP D
   opens by consuming all five named inputs -- [C-43 FAIL by design: grouped annotation].
10. PART 2 STEP D closes with:
    Confirmed readiness: [READY / CONDITIONALLY READY / NOT READY] -> STEP E (forward arrow).
11. PART 2 STEP E opens with two independent per-input prohibitions (C-36 PASS):
    Required input -- do not re-derive: Confirmed readiness from STEP D
    Required input -- do not re-derive: Inertia case from STEP A
    Each annotation is a complete standalone statement.
12. PART 2 STEP E closes with [C-44 PASS: inline forward-declaration arrow on verdict line]:
    Required output -- emit exactly:
      Terminal readiness: [PROCEED / LOOP / INVESTIGATE + one-phrase reason] -> topic namespace
    [C-44 PASS: arrow is inline on the verdict line itself, naming external consumer by identity]

======================================================================
PART 1 -- ANALYTICAL RECORD  (internal -- not for team use)
======================================================================

==== STEP 0: INERTIA ANCHOR  (~30 words) ====

Before the inventory: what is the team doing today if {{topic}} does not ship?
State the status-quo alternative in one sentence. This is the inertia competitor.

==== STEP 1: ARTIFACT INVENTORY  (~150 words) ====

| Artifact | Namespace | Date | Signal Carried | Inertia Relevant? |
|----------|-----------|------|----------------|-------------------|
(Inertia Relevant: does this artifact speak to the comparison between {{topic}} and
the status-quo alternative -- competitors, benchmarks, usage data, mechanism evidence?
Mark yes / no.)

Empty namespaces (scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic):
  list each -- expected gap or meaningful blind spot?

Inertia-relevant artifact count (from column above):
  1 or more -> staleness threshold = 14 days
  0         -> staleness threshold = 30 days

==== STEP 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS -- CAUSAL GAP FIRST  (~540 words) ====

Analysis order: CAUSAL GAP -> SEQUENCE -> COHERENCE -> STALENESS.
For each: cite artifacts by name, severity internally (not a gate), coaching
observation, one concrete next action if flagged.

### CAUSAL GAP

Inertia-relevant pool: [list every artifact tagged yes in Step 1].
Evaluate mechanism evidence from this pool only.

Inertia anchor: [restate Step 0 in one phrase].

If pool is EMPTY:
  Mechanism verdict is absent by default. State explicitly. Name what artifact types
  would populate the pool. Do not draw on non-pool artifacts.

If pool is NON-EMPTY:
  Is there evidence for the pathway from {{topic}} to its claimed outcome, specifically
  better than the status-quo alternative? State: present / partial / absent.

(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

[MECHANISM VERDICT: present / partial / absent -- key gap if any: ___]
<- SEQUENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]. Quote verbatim.
<- PART 2 STEP A: Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]. Quote verbatim.

### SEQUENCE

Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]
Quoting mechanism verdict: "[MECHANISM VERDICT from above -- paste verbatim]"

Cite 2+ artifacts with dates. Did discovery precede specification?
Read ordering through mechanism lens: did inertia-relevant pool artifacts appear in
the discovery phase, or did the team specify before mechanism evidence existed?
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Pre-specification gap: [YES -- mechanism gap existed before earliest spec artifact /
  NO -- mechanism evidence was present when team committed to spec]
<- STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap. Consume by label.
<- PART 2 STEP C SEQUENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap.

### COHERENCE

Name 2+ signals on a specific claim: aligned / contradicting / inconclusive.
For each contradiction: name the two signals, state the specific disagreement, tag
whether mechanism-relevant.
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Mechanism-relevant contradiction: [YES -- name the contradiction and inertia-pool artifact /
  NO -- no contradiction involves inertia-pool signals]
<- STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction. Consume by label.
<- PART 2 STEP C COHERENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction.

### STALENESS

Apply threshold from Step 1 (14 or 30 days). Inertia-pool artifacts inside / outside window?
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Mechanism-stale: [YES -- name inertia-pool artifact(s) outside threshold /
  NO -- all inertia-pool artifacts within threshold]
<- STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale. Consume by label.
<- PART 2 STEP C STALENESS: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale.

==== STEP 3: CROSS-DIMENSION PATTERN  (~90 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap from SEQUENCE
Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction from COHERENCE
Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale from STALENESS
Pool status: [empty / thin / adequate -- from CAUSAL GAP]

From these named outputs:
- Pre-specification gap YES + thin/empty pool -> "Commitment before evidence"
- Mechanism-stale YES + partial verdict -> "Stale mechanism comparison"
- Mechanism-relevant contradiction YES + partial/absent verdict -> "Mechanism contradiction"
- Empty pool -> "Empty inertia pool"
- No shared root -> "Isolated flags" or "none"

Root pattern: [SHORT NAME -- drawn from named outputs; do not describe in prose only]
-> PART 2 STEP B: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern. Reference by label.
-> PART 2 STEP C per-dim: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern.
-> PART 2 STEP D: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern. Reference by label.

======================================================================
PART 2 -- TEAM COACHING REPORT  (advisory -- no severity labels)
======================================================================

==== STEP A: INERTIA CASE STRENGTH  (~100 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]
Quoting mechanism verdict: "[MECHANISM VERDICT from PART 1 -- paste verbatim]"

Based on that verdict and the full artifact record for {{topic}}, is the case
that it beats doing nothing:
  [ ] Clearly built -- mechanism evidence present, status-quo comparison addressed
  [ ] Partially built -- some evidence exists but specific gaps remain; name the key one
  [ ] Still open -- mechanism or comparison not established in the artifact record

State which applies. Advisory -- not a gate.

Inertia case: [BUILT / PARTIAL / OPEN + one-phrase reason]
-> STEP E: Required input -- do not re-derive: Inertia case. Consume by label.

==== STEP B: DRAFT READINESS  (~75 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3

From Part 1: which dimensions look clean, which have something worth noticing?
If Root pattern is not "none" or "Isolated flags": name the Root pattern explicitly
before individual observations -- the team sees the cross-dimension shape first.
Label: [DRAFT -- to be confirmed after STEP D and finalized in STEP E]

==== STEP C: DIMENSION OBSERVATIONS  (~340 words) ====

CAUSAL GAP-first. Advisory. No severity, scores, or gates.
Per-dimension: state Root pattern contribution and close with STEP C drift binary.

CAUSAL GAP: [coaching observation -- pool status; if empty, name artifact types needed;
  if non-empty, note what evidence exists and what is missing]
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3
  Root pattern contribution: [CAUSAL GAP contributed to Root pattern: "[label from STEP 3]"
    / CAUSAL GAP is an isolated flag]
  STEP C drift: [CLOSED -- CAUSAL GAP coaching aligns with Root pattern "[label]" /
    OPEN -- CAUSAL GAP coaching diverges; reason: ...]
  If flagged -> suggested next step:

SEQUENCE: [coaching observation]
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap from SEQUENCE
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3
  Root pattern contribution: [SEQUENCE contributed to Root pattern: "[label]"
    / SEQUENCE is an isolated flag]
  STEP C drift: [CLOSED / OPEN + reason]
  If flagged -> suggested next step:

COHERENCE: [coaching observation]
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction from COHERENCE
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3
  Root pattern contribution: [COHERENCE contributed to Root pattern: "[label]"
    / COHERENCE is an isolated flag]
  STEP C drift: [CLOSED / OPEN + reason]
  If flagged -> suggested next step:

STALENESS: [coaching observation]
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale from STALENESS
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3
  Root pattern contribution: [STALENESS contributed to Root pattern: "[label]"
    / STALENESS is an isolated flag]
  STEP C drift: [CLOSED / OPEN + reason]
  If flagged -> suggested next step:

==== STEP D: CONFIRMED READINESS  (~90 words) ====

Required inputs -- do not re-derive [Root pattern from STEP 3; STEP C drift -- CAUSAL GAP;
  STEP C drift -- SEQUENCE; STEP C drift -- COHERENCE; STEP C drift -- STALENESS]:
  consume all five by label above
[C-43 FAIL: grouped annotation at 5-input intermediate step; C-28 co-fails by entailment;
 single-axis C-44 isolation]

Drift summary (consume each from STEP C labels above -- do not re-infer from prose):
  CAUSAL GAP: [CLOSED / OPEN]
  SEQUENCE:   [CLOSED / OPEN]
  COHERENCE:  [CLOSED / OPEN]
  STALENESS:  [CLOSED / OPEN]

If all CLOSED: per-dimension coaching confirmed Root pattern without divergence.
If any OPEN: name dimension(s) and reason for divergence.

Confirmed readiness: [READY -- all drift CLOSED, mechanism evidence sufficient /
  CONDITIONALLY READY -- [list conditions]; one more loop recommended on [dimension] /
  NOT READY -- [dimension] OPEN; mechanism or timing gap must be addressed]
-> STEP E: Required input -- do not re-derive: Confirmed readiness. Consume by label.

==== STEP E: TEAM READINESS POSITION  (~90 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Confirmed readiness from STEP D
Required input -- do not re-derive: Inertia case from STEP A

From the two grounded inputs above -- state the team-facing position:

1. Dimensions clean vs. flagged (count)
2. Most useful thing to address before committing
3. Confirmed readiness: [READY / CONDITIONALLY READY / NOT READY]
4. Inertia case: [BUILT / PARTIAL / OPEN]
5. Overall read: proceed / loop once more / investigate further

Required output -- emit exactly:
  Terminal readiness: [PROCEED / LOOP / INVESTIGATE + one-phrase reason] -> topic namespace
[C-44 PASS: forward-declaration arrow inline on verdict line; external consumer named by identity]
```

## V-03 — Single Axis: C-45 (ARCHITECTURE Meta-Rule Names Independence as Positive Standard)

**Axes**: C-45 PASS (ARCHITECTURE meta-rule explicitly states: "each annotation parseable as a complete statement without relying on proximity to other annotations — independence standard, not merely non-grouping"). C-43 FAIL by design (STEP D grouped — C-28 co-fails by entailment). C-44 FAIL by design (terminal verdict uses separate-line arrow, not inline).
**Hypothesis**: C-45 requires the ARCHITECTURE meta-rule to name the positive standard (independence / parseable completeness) rather than only prohibiting the negative form (grouping). The current R3 V-05 meta-rule — "not grouped across multiple inputs at the same step" — specifies what to avoid without specifying what to achieve. A prompt can satisfy "not grouped" with two syntactically separate lines that still semantically rely on proximity for interpretation; naming independence as the positive standard makes that partial compliance architecturally impermissible. C-43 and C-44 are intentionally degraded to isolate C-45 — STEP D is grouped (C-43 FAIL + C-28 co-fail) and the terminal verdict carries no inline forward arrow (C-44 FAIL).

## V-04 — All Three Combined: C-43 + C-44 + C-45, Advisory Register (Canonical)

**Axes**: C-43 PASS (all multi-input consuming steps pipeline-wide use independently self-standing per-input annotations) + C-44 PASS (terminal verdict carries inline `-> topic namespace` forward-declaration arrow) + C-45 PASS (ARCHITECTURE meta-rule names independence as positive standard). Advisory register throughout.
**Hypothesis**: V-04 is the canonical advisory form for R4. The three criteria complete the structural architecture at three independent points: C-45 elevates the ARCHITECTURE meta-rule from a prohibition to a positive contract (independence standard); C-43 generalizes C-36's independence requirement from STEP E to the full pipeline; C-44 closes the last asymmetric annotation gap at the terminal production site — the forward-declaration arrow is now inline on the verdict line, not only accessible via the ARCHITECTURE table's Consumed-by entry. Together they represent three distinct structural closes: one at the meta-rule level (C-45), one at intermediate steps (C-43 at STEP D), and one at the terminal production site (C-44). V-04 predicts 37/37 at zero structural overhead relative to R3 V-05.

==== STEP 0: INERTIA ANCHOR  (~30 words) ====

Before the inventory: what is the team doing today if {{topic}} does not ship?
State the status-quo alternative in one sentence. This is the inertia competitor.

==== STEP 1: ARTIFACT INVENTORY  (~150 words) ====

| Artifact | Namespace | Date | Signal Carried | Inertia Relevant? |
|----------|-----------|------|----------------|-------------------|
(Inertia Relevant: does this artifact speak to the comparison between {{topic}} and
the status-quo alternative -- competitors, benchmarks, usage data, mechanism evidence?
Mark yes / no.)

Empty namespaces (scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic):
  list each -- expected gap or meaningful blind spot?

Inertia-relevant artifact count (from column above):
  1 or more -> staleness threshold = 14 days
  0         -> staleness threshold = 30 days

==== STEP 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS -- CAUSAL GAP FIRST  (~540 words) ====

Analysis order: CAUSAL GAP -> SEQUENCE -> COHERENCE -> STALENESS.
For each: cite artifacts by name, severity internally (not a gate), coaching
observation, one concrete next action if flagged.

### CAUSAL GAP

Inertia-relevant pool: [list every artifact tagged yes in Step 1].
Evaluate mechanism evidence from this pool only.

Inertia anchor: [restate Step 0 in one phrase].

If pool is EMPTY:
  Mechanism verdict is absent by default. State explicitly. Name what artifact types
  would populate the pool. Do not draw on non-pool artifacts.

If pool is NON-EMPTY:
  Is there evidence for the pathway from {{topic}} to its claimed outcome, specifically
  better than the status-quo alternative? State: present / partial / absent.

(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

[MECHANISM VERDICT: present / partial / absent -- key gap if any: ___]
<- SEQUENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]. Quote verbatim.
<- PART 2 STEP A: Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]. Quote verbatim.

### SEQUENCE

Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]
Quoting mechanism verdict: "[MECHANISM VERDICT from above -- paste verbatim]"

Cite 2+ artifacts with dates. Did discovery precede specification?
Read ordering through mechanism lens: did inertia-relevant pool artifacts appear in
the discovery phase, or did the team specify before mechanism evidence existed?
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Pre-specification gap: [YES -- mechanism gap existed before earliest spec artifact /
  NO -- mechanism evidence was present when team committed to spec]
<- STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap. Consume by label.
<- PART 2 STEP C SEQUENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap.

### COHERENCE

Name 2+ signals on a specific claim: aligned / contradicting / inconclusive.
For each contradiction: name the two signals, state the specific disagreement, tag
whether mechanism-relevant.
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Mechanism-relevant contradiction: [YES -- name the contradiction and inertia-pool artifact /
  NO -- no contradiction involves inertia-pool signals]
<- STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction. Consume by label.
<- PART 2 STEP C COHERENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction.

### STALENESS

Apply threshold from Step 1 (14 or 30 days). Inertia-pool artifacts inside / outside window?
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Mechanism-stale: [YES -- name inertia-pool artifact(s) outside threshold /
  NO -- all inertia-pool artifacts within threshold]
<- STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale. Consume by label.

Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale from STALENESS
Pool status: [empty / thin / adequate -- from CAUSAL GAP]
[C-43 PASS: three independent per-input annotations at this 3-input consuming step]

From these named outputs:
- Pre-specification gap YES + thin/empty pool -> "Commitment before evidence"
- Mechanism-stale YES + partial verdict -> "Stale mechanism comparison"
- Mechanism-relevant contradiction YES + partial/absent verdict -> "Mechanism contradiction"
- Empty pool -> "Empty inertia pool"

==== STEP A: INERTIA CASE STRENGTH  (~100 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]
Quoting mechanism verdict: "[MECHANISM VERDICT from PART 1 -- paste verbatim]"

Based on that verdict and the full artifact record for {{topic}}, is the case
that it beats doing nothing:
  [ ] Clearly built -- mechanism evidence present, status-quo comparison addressed
  [ ] Partially built -- some evidence exists but specific gaps remain; name the key one
  [ ] Still open -- mechanism or comparison not established in the artifact record

State which applies. Advisory -- not a gate.

Inertia case: [BUILT / PARTIAL / OPEN + one-phrase reason]
-> STEP E: Required input -- do not re-derive: Inertia case. Consume by label.

==== STEP B: DRAFT READINESS  (~75 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3

From Part 1: which dimensions look clean, which have something worth noticing?
If Root pattern is not "none" or "Isolated flags": name the Root pattern explicitly
before individual observations -- the team sees the cross-dimension shape first.
Label: [DRAFT -- to be confirmed after STEP D and finalized in STEP E]

==== STEP C: DIMENSION OBSERVATIONS  (~340 words) ====

CAUSAL GAP-first. Advisory. No severity, scores, or gates.

## V-05 — All Three Combined: C-43 + C-44 + C-45, Alternative Meta-Rule Phrasing

**Axes**: C-43 PASS + C-44 PASS + C-45 PASS. Same structural properties as V-04 but with the ARCHITECTURE meta-rule phrased as a positive parseable-completeness contract (forward-stating the requirement) rather than as a negative-plus-positive form. Specifically: the meta-rule in V-05 reads "Pipeline-wide: each per-input annotation must be parseable as a complete `Required input -- do not re-derive: [label]` statement in isolation — without reading adjacent annotations or relying on a shared header for scope" rather than V-04's "each annotation parseable as a complete statement without relying on proximity to other annotations."
**Hypothesis**: C-45 PASS requires the meta-rule to name the independence standard (parseable completeness) as the governing property for multi-input consuming steps. V-05 tests whether alternative phrasings of that standard — specifically a forward-statement ("each annotation must be parseable in isolation") rather than a negative-plus-positive form ("independence standard; not merely non-grouping") — still satisfy C-45 when the core property is preserved. The structural outcome is identical to V-04: all three new criteria pass. The question is whether the meta-rule's phrasing variation is semantically equivalent for C-45 purposes, or whether the specific "independence standard" terminology is required.

5. PART 2 opens with STEP A: INERTIA CASE STRENGTH as a dedicated named section. STEP A
   opens by quoting the MECHANISM VERDICT verbatim and closes with:
   Inertia case: [BUILT / PARTIAL / OPEN + reason] -> STEP E (forward arrow).
6. COHERENCE closes with: Mechanism-relevant contradiction: [YES / NO + reason].
7. STALENESS closes with: Mechanism-stale: [YES / NO + reason].
8. STEP 3 closes with: Root pattern: [SHORT NAME].
9. PART 2 STEP C each dimension closes with STEP C drift: CLOSED/OPEN. PART 2 STEP D
   opens by consuming all five named inputs by label -- one independently parseable
   per-input annotation each (pipeline-wide standard applies at this 5-input step).
10. PART 2 STEP D closes with:
    Confirmed readiness: [READY / CONDITIONALLY READY / NOT READY] -> STEP E (forward arrow).
11. PART 2 STEP E opens with two independently parseable per-input prohibitions (C-36 PASS):
    Required input -- do not re-derive: Confirmed readiness from STEP D
    Required input -- do not re-derive: Inertia case from STEP A
    Each annotation stands alone: readable in isolation, no shared header, no proximity reliance.
12. PART 2 STEP E closes with [C-44 PASS + C-39 PASS]:
    Required output -- emit exactly:
      Terminal readiness: [PROCEED / LOOP / INVESTIGATE + one-phrase reason] -> topic namespace
    [C-44 PASS: external consumer identity declared inline on verdict line at production site]

======================================================================
PART 1 -- ANALYTICAL RECORD  (internal -- not for team use)
======================================================================

==== STEP 0: INERTIA ANCHOR  (~30 words) ====

Before the inventory: what is the team doing today if {{topic}} does not ship?
State the status-quo alternative in one sentence. This is the inertia competitor.

==== STEP 1: ARTIFACT INVENTORY  (~150 words) ====

| Artifact | Namespace | Date | Signal Carried | Inertia Relevant? |
|----------|-----------|------|----------------|-------------------|
(Inertia Relevant: does this artifact speak to the comparison between {{topic}} and
the status-quo alternative -- competitors, benchmarks, usage data, mechanism evidence?
Mark yes / no.)

Empty namespaces (scout, draft, review, flow, trace, prove, listen, program, topic):
  list each -- expected gap or meaningful blind spot?

Inertia-relevant artifact count (from column above):
  1 or more -> staleness threshold = 14 days
  0         -> staleness threshold = 30 days

==== STEP 2: DIMENSION ANALYSIS -- CAUSAL GAP FIRST  (~540 words) ====

Analysis order: CAUSAL GAP -> SEQUENCE -> COHERENCE -> STALENESS.
For each: cite artifacts by name, severity internally (not a gate), coaching
observation, one concrete next action if flagged.

### CAUSAL GAP

Inertia-relevant pool: [list every artifact tagged yes in Step 1].
Evaluate mechanism evidence from this pool only.

Inertia anchor: [restate Step 0 in one phrase].

If pool is EMPTY:
  Mechanism verdict is absent by default. State explicitly. Name what artifact types
  would populate the pool. Do not draw on non-pool artifacts.

If pool is NON-EMPTY:
  Is there evidence for the pathway from {{topic}} to its claimed outcome, specifically
  better than the status-quo alternative? State: present / partial / absent.

(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

[MECHANISM VERDICT: present / partial / absent -- key gap if any: ___]
<- SEQUENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]. Quote verbatim.
<- PART 2 STEP A: Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]. Quote verbatim.

### SEQUENCE

Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]
Quoting mechanism verdict: "[MECHANISM VERDICT from above -- paste verbatim]"

Cite 2+ artifacts with dates. Did discovery precede specification?
Read ordering through mechanism lens: did inertia-relevant pool artifacts appear in
the discovery phase, or did the team specify before mechanism evidence existed?
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Pre-specification gap: [YES -- mechanism gap existed before earliest spec artifact /
  NO -- mechanism evidence was present when team committed to spec]
<- STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap. Consume by label.
<- PART 2 STEP C SEQUENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap.

### COHERENCE

Name 2+ signals on a specific claim: aligned / contradicting / inconclusive.
For each contradiction: name the two signals, state the specific disagreement, tag
whether mechanism-relevant.
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Mechanism-relevant contradiction: [YES -- name the contradiction and inertia-pool artifact /
  NO -- no contradiction involves inertia-pool signals]
<- STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction. Consume by label.
<- PART 2 STEP C COHERENCE: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction.

### STALENESS

Apply threshold from Step 1 (14 or 30 days). Inertia-pool artifacts inside / outside window?
(internal: green / yellow / red)
Observation: ...
If yellow or red -> next action:

Mechanism-stale: [YES -- name inertia-pool artifact(s) outside threshold /
  NO -- all inertia-pool artifacts within threshold]
<- STEP 3: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale. Consume by label.
<- PART 2 STEP C STALENESS: Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale.

==== STEP 3: CROSS-DIMENSION PATTERN  (~90 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap from SEQUENCE
Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction from COHERENCE
Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale from STALENESS
Pool status: [empty / thin / adequate -- from CAUSAL GAP]

From these named outputs:
- Pre-specification gap YES + thin/empty pool -> "Commitment before evidence"
- Mechanism-stale YES + partial verdict -> "Stale mechanism comparison"
- Mechanism-relevant contradiction YES + partial/absent verdict -> "Mechanism contradiction"
- Empty pool -> "Empty inertia pool"
- No shared root -> "Isolated flags" or "none"

Root pattern: [SHORT NAME -- drawn from named outputs; do not describe in prose only]
-> PART 2 STEP B: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern. Reference by label.
-> PART 2 STEP C per-dim: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern.
-> PART 2 STEP D: Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern. Reference by label.

======================================================================
PART 2 -- TEAM COACHING REPORT  (advisory -- no severity labels)
======================================================================

==== STEP A: INERTIA CASE STRENGTH  (~100 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: [MECHANISM VERDICT]
Quoting mechanism verdict: "[MECHANISM VERDICT from PART 1 -- paste verbatim]"

Based on that verdict and the full artifact record for {{topic}}, is the case
that it beats doing nothing:
  [ ] Clearly built -- mechanism evidence present, status-quo comparison addressed
  [ ] Partially built -- some evidence exists but specific gaps remain; name the key one
  [ ] Still open -- mechanism or comparison not established in the artifact record

State which applies. Advisory -- not a gate.

Inertia case: [BUILT / PARTIAL / OPEN + one-phrase reason]
-> STEP E: Required input -- do not re-derive: Inertia case. Consume by label.

==== STEP B: DRAFT READINESS  (~75 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3

From Part 1: which dimensions look clean, which have something worth noticing?
If Root pattern is not "none" or "Isolated flags": name the Root pattern explicitly
before individual observations -- the team sees the cross-dimension shape first.
Label: [DRAFT -- to be confirmed after STEP D and finalized in STEP E]

==== STEP C: DIMENSION OBSERVATIONS  (~340 words) ====

CAUSAL GAP-first. Advisory. No severity, scores, or gates.
Per-dimension: state Root pattern contribution and close with STEP C drift binary.

CAUSAL GAP: [coaching observation -- pool status; if empty, name artifact types needed;
  if non-empty, note what evidence exists and what is missing]
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3
  Root pattern contribution: [CAUSAL GAP contributed to Root pattern: "[label from STEP 3]"
    / CAUSAL GAP is an isolated flag]
  STEP C drift: [CLOSED -- CAUSAL GAP coaching aligns with Root pattern "[label]" /
    OPEN -- CAUSAL GAP coaching diverges; reason: ...]
  If flagged -> suggested next step:

SEQUENCE: [coaching observation]
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Pre-specification gap from SEQUENCE
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3
  Root pattern contribution: [SEQUENCE contributed to Root pattern: "[label]"
    / SEQUENCE is an isolated flag]
  STEP C drift: [CLOSED / OPEN + reason]
  If flagged -> suggested next step:

COHERENCE: [coaching observation]
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-relevant contradiction from COHERENCE
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3
  Root pattern contribution: [COHERENCE contributed to Root pattern: "[label]"
    / COHERENCE is an isolated flag]
  STEP C drift: [CLOSED / OPEN + reason]
  If flagged -> suggested next step:

STALENESS: [coaching observation]
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Mechanism-stale from STALENESS
  Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3
  Root pattern contribution: [STALENESS contributed to Root pattern: "[label]"
    / STALENESS is an isolated flag]
  STEP C drift: [CLOSED / OPEN + reason]
  If flagged -> suggested next step:

==== STEP D: CONFIRMED READINESS  (~90 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Root pattern from STEP 3
Required input -- do not re-derive: STEP C drift -- CAUSAL GAP from PART 2 STEP C
Required input -- do not re-derive: STEP C drift -- SEQUENCE from PART 2 STEP C
Required input -- do not re-derive: STEP C drift -- COHERENCE from PART 2 STEP C
Required input -- do not re-derive: STEP C drift -- STALENESS from PART 2 STEP C
(each annotation parseable in isolation -- no shared header, no proximity reliance)

Drift summary (consume each from STEP C labels above -- do not re-infer from prose):
  CAUSAL GAP: [CLOSED / OPEN]
  SEQUENCE:   [CLOSED / OPEN]
  COHERENCE:  [CLOSED / OPEN]
  STALENESS:  [CLOSED / OPEN]

If all CLOSED: per-dimension coaching confirmed Root pattern without divergence.
If any OPEN: name dimension(s) and reason for divergence.

Confirmed readiness: [READY -- all drift CLOSED, mechanism evidence sufficient /
  CONDITIONALLY READY -- [list conditions]; one more loop recommended on [dimension] /
  NOT READY -- [dimension] OPEN; mechanism or timing gap must be addressed]
-> STEP E: Required input -- do not re-derive: Confirmed readiness. Consume by label.

==== STEP E: TEAM READINESS POSITION  (~90 words) ====

Required input -- do not re-derive: Confirmed readiness from STEP D
Required input -- do not re-derive: Inertia case from STEP A

From the two grounded inputs above -- state the team-facing position:

1. Dimensions clean vs. flagged (count)
2. Most useful thing to address before committing
3. Confirmed readiness: [READY / CONDITIONALLY READY / NOT READY]
4. Inertia case: [BUILT / PARTIAL / OPEN]
5. Overall read: proceed / loop once more / investigate further

Required output -- emit exactly:
  Terminal readiness: [PROCEED / LOOP / INVESTIGATE + one-phrase reason] -> topic namespace
[C-44 PASS: external consumer identity inline on verdict line; parseable-in-isolation standard
 from meta-rule extends to this production site annotation as well]
```
