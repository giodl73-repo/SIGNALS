## roles-create R10 -- 5 Variations

**Design pivot:** R9 proved the equivalence class (all 5 at 100). v9 added C-24/C-25/C-26, making V-05 the sole passing form. R10 probes the adversarial space of those three new criteria.

### Variation Matrix

| ID | Axis | Targeted failure | Est. |
|----|------|-----------------|------|
| V-01 | Output format -- mixed gate forms | Phase 0 uses gate TABLE; all other phases inline | C-24 only | 99.47 |
| V-02 | Lifecycle emphasis -- expanded phase bodies | Connector openers + fix-and-retry prose added (C-19-safe) | C-25 only | 99.47 |
| V-03 | Role sequence -- adjacent CONTRACTS swap | COLUMN-HEADER before FIELD-REGISTER (Phase-4-cited before Phase-3-cited) | C-26 only | 99.47 |
| V-04 | Combination C-25+C-26 | V-02 prose + V-03 swap | C-25+C-26 | 98.95 |
| V-05 | Full ceiling | R9 V-05 reproduced | none | 100 |

### Key discrimination questions

- **V-01:** Does C-24 fire on a single out-of-form gate? Expected yes. C-15/C-18 remain format-neutral (confirmed R9); C-24 adds the homogeneity requirement on top.
- **V-02:** Can C-19 pass while C-25 fails? Expected yes. Bridging prose that contextualizes phases without restating CONTRACT rules violates C-25 (exceeds minimum surface) while leaving C-19 intact.
- **V-03:** Does C-26 apply to adjacent main-flow pairs? Expected yes. FIELD-REGISTER/COLUMN-HEADER are both unconditional (Phase 3/4); swapping them is a clear citation-sequence violation, different in degree from R9 V-03's INERTIA-ADVOCATE displacement to position 1.
- **V-04:** Are C-25 and C-26 independent (no cascade)? Expected yes -- 2×(10/19) deduction, score lands exactly 98.95.
ributed-in-phase and bidirectionality) while C-24 adds the homogeneity requirement on top.
- **V-02:** Can a phase body satisfy C-19 (no rule restatement) but fail C-25 (more than citation + artifact)? Expected: yes -- C-25 is a stronger constraint than C-19. Bridging prose that contextualizes the phase without restating CONTRACT rules passes C-19 and fails C-25.
- **V-03:** Does C-26 apply to main-flow CONTRACT pairs (FIELD-REGISTER/COLUMN-HEADER, both unconditionally cited) or only to the INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE displacement that V-03 (R9) introduced? Expected: C-26 applies to any out-of-citation-sequence placement -- swapping an adjacent main-flow pair is a clear C-26 violation even if less dramatic than the R9 V-03 case.
- **V-04:** Are C-25 and C-26 independent? Expected: yes -- one governs phase surface area, the other CONTRACTS ordering; failing both costs exactly two aspirational points (2 x 10/19).
- **V-05:** Confirms no regression from carrying R9 V-05 forward. The canonical form is now the R10 baseline.

**V-03 note on C-26 interpretation:** The R9 rubric states V-05 passes C-26 (canonical ordering). In V-05, the CONTRACTS block order is INPUT-ROUTING-RULES -> INTERACTIVE-HOLD -> FIELD-REGISTER -> COLUMN-HEADER -> INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE -> AUDIT-CHECKLIST. FIELD-REGISTER (first cited Phase 3) appears before COLUMN-HEADER (first cited Phase 4) -- this is the ordering C-26 requires for these two main-flow contracts. V-03 swaps them, putting COLUMN-HEADER before FIELD-REGISTER, violating the Phase 3 < Phase 4 citation sequence. This is the targeted C-26 probe for R10.

---

### V-01: Output Format -- Mixed Gate Forms

**Axis:** Gate structural form. Phase 0 uses a per-phase gate TABLE (columns: Gate / [ID] / Criterion / Verdict). All other content-producing phases (2, 3, 4) retain inline `-> Gate N [ID]: ... PASS / FAIL` annotations. Phase 5 is the confirmation checklist (not a gate phase; exempt from C-24). CONTRACTS block unchanged from V-05. Phase bodies unchanged from V-05 (thin citations, minimum surface). This is the minimal structural change needed to trigger C-24: one phase using a different structural form than the rest.

**Hypothesis:** 99.47. C-24 fails (mixed gate forms: one table amid inline annotations). All other criteria pass. C-15 passes (gate table in Phase 0 is still distributed in-phase, not consolidated). C-18 passes (the `[ID]` column in the Phase 0 table provides the backward reference for item [G], satisfying bidirectionality). C-25 passes (phase bodies are minimum surface: one citation + one artifact, no bridging prose). C-26 passes (CONTRACTS in canonical first-citation sequence). C-23 passes (table rows are structural labels, not rule content).

**v9 criterion under probe:** C-24 -- gate structural form must be homogeneous across all content-producing phases.

2. Main role: `.craft/roles/{area}/{subrole}.md`

Confirm both paths in output.

---

### V-02: Lifecycle Emphasis -- Expanded Phase Bodies

**Axis:** Lifecycle emphasis. Each content-producing phase body receives additional prose beyond the minimum CONTRACT citation + artifact reference. The additions are: (a) a connector opener sentence that contextualizes the phase in the overall flow, and (b) fix-and-retry workflow text ("If any gate fails, fix before advancing"). These additions are C-19-safe: they do not restate rule content from any CONTRACT block. The gate annotations and CONTRACTS block are unchanged from V-05. This is the minimum change needed to trigger C-25: prose that passes C-19 but exceeds minimum surface.

**Hypothesis:** 99.47. C-25 fails (phase bodies exceed citation + artifact -- they include connector openers and fix-and-retry language). C-19 passes (no rule restatement -- the extra prose provides workflow context, not CONTRACT rule content). All other criteria pass. C-24 passes (all inline gates, consistent form). C-26 passes (CONTRACTS in canonical first-citation sequence).

**v9 criterion under probe:** C-25 -- each content-producing phase body must achieve minimum surface: one CONTRACT citation + one artifact reference, nothing more. Bridging prose = fail even if C-19 passes.

### PHASES

---

#### PHASE 0 -- Input Guard

The input guard resolves ambiguous or malformed inputs before the routing pipeline proceeds. Apply CONTRACT: INPUT-ROUTING-RULES.

If input is BARE AREA or VAGUE PHRASE: ask the clarifying question from the contract. Do not proceed to Phase 1 until the user responds with a clean input.

-> **Gate 0 [G]:** CONTRACT: INPUT-ROUTING-RULES applied. Input classified as clean or resolved. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 1 -- Mode Detection

With clean input confirmed, the mode is identified and the appropriate path selected.

-> **Gate 1:** area and subrole known and non-empty (or all three interactive answers confirmed). PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 2 -- Inertia-Advocate Check

Before generating the requested role, the companion check ensures the area's status-quo voice is present. Check whether `.craft/roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md` exists.

- **ABSENT:** Apply CONTRACT: INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE. Generate companion file content. Substitute all `{area}` slots. Store in working memory. Do not write yet. If any gate fails, fix and re-check before advancing.

  -> **Gate 2b:** Companion file path confirmed as `.craft/roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md`. PASS / FAIL

- **PRESENT:** Continue to Phase 3.

---

#### PHASE 3 -- Generate Frontmatter

With area, subrole, and companion status resolved, generate the role's YAML frontmatter. Apply CONTRACT: FIELD-REGISTER. Generate all 12 required fields for `.craft/roles/{area}/{subrole}.md`. If any gate fails, fix the failing field and re-check the gate before advancing to Phase 4.

-> **Gate 3a [B]:** All 12 fields present in the generated frontmatter. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 3b [C]:** orientation.frame passes CONTRACT: FIELD-REGISTER (first-person observational). PASS / FAIL

-> **Gate 4c:** Table contains at least 3 domain-specific rows. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 5 -- Pre-Write Confirmation

All items in CONTRACT: AUDIT-CHECKLIST have been gated at their respective phases. Confirm each is resolved:

```
[A] Path correctness: .craft/roles/{area}/{subrole}.md confirmed? ___
[B] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- frontmatter completeness -- confirmed Gate 3a? ___
[C] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- orientation.frame -- confirmed Gate 3b? ___
[D] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- orientation.serves -- confirmed Gate 3c? ___
[E] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- lens.verify -- confirmed Gate 3d? ___
[F] COLUMN-HEADER compliance -- body table -- confirmed Gate 4b? ___
[G] INPUT-ROUTING-RULES compliance -- confirmed Gate 0? ___
[H] If inertia-advocate generated: INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE compliance -- confirmed Gate 2a? ___ (N/A if already existed)
```

All items must show YES (or N/A for H). Any NO = identify the failed gate, fix, re-check the phase gate, return here.

---

#### PHASE 6 -- Write Files

Write in order:
1. If companion generated in Phase 2: `.craft/roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md`
2. Main role: `.craft/roles/{area}/{subrole}.md`

Confirm both paths in output.

---

### V-03: Role Sequence -- Adjacent CONTRACTS Swap

**Axis:** CONTRACTS block ordering. COLUMN-HEADER and FIELD-REGISTER are swapped in the CONTRACTS block relative to the V-05 canonical order: COLUMN-HEADER now appears at position 3 and FIELD-REGISTER at position 4. FIELD-REGISTER is first cited in Phase 3; COLUMN-HEADER is first cited in Phase 4. Placing COLUMN-HEADER before FIELD-REGISTER puts a Phase-4-cited CONTRACT before a Phase-3-cited CONTRACT -- a direct C-26 violation. All phase bodies are unchanged from V-05 (minimum surface; no bridging prose). All gate forms are unchanged from V-05 (inline annotations throughout).

**Hypothesis:** 99.47. C-26 fails (COLUMN-HEADER defined before FIELD-REGISTER, but FIELD-REGISTER is first cited at Phase 3 and COLUMN-HEADER at Phase 4 -- out of citation sequence). All other criteria pass. C-24 passes (all inline gates). C-25 passes (minimum phase surface). C-21 passes (all cited blocks have checklist items; ordering is irrelevant to coverage). C-17 passes (CONTRACT blocks are still named and present). C-19 passes (phase bodies are thin citations, not affected by CONTRACTS reordering).

**v9 criterion under probe:** C-26 -- CONTRACTS block ordering must mirror first-citation sequence across phases. A Phase-4-cited CONTRACT appearing before a Phase-3-cited CONTRACT = fail.

---

#### PHASE 5 -- Pre-Write Confirmation

All items in CONTRACT: AUDIT-CHECKLIST have been gated at their respective phases. Confirm each is resolved:

```
[A] Path correctness: .craft/roles/{area}/{subrole}.md confirmed? ___
[B] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- frontmatter completeness -- confirmed Gate 3a? ___
[C] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- orientation.frame -- confirmed Gate 3b? ___

1. If companion generated in Phase 2: `.craft/roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md`
2. Main role: `.craft/roles/{area}/{subrole}.md`

Confirm both paths in output.

---

### V-04: Combination -- C-25+C-26

**Axis:** Two-criterion combination. V-02's expanded phase bodies (bridging prose in every content-producing phase) combined with V-03's CONTRACTS swap (COLUMN-HEADER before FIELD-REGISTER). These are structurally independent changes: C-25 governs phase surface area, C-26 governs CONTRACTS ordering. Neither failure cascades to the other. This variation confirms that v9's three new criteria are orthogonal -- two can fail independently without pulling any third criterion down.

**Hypothesis:** 98.95. C-25 fails (phase bodies contain bridging prose beyond citation + artifact). C-26 fails (COLUMN-HEADER defined before FIELD-REGISTER, out of Phase-3/Phase-4 citation sequence). All other 17 aspirational criteria pass. C-19 passes (no rule restatement in the expanded prose). C-24 passes (all inline gates, consistent form). The combined failure costs 2 x (10/19) = 1.05 pts, yielding 17/19 x 10 = 8.95 aspirational points. Formula: 60 + 30 + 8.95 = 98.95.

**v9 criteria under probe:** C-25 (phase surface minimization) + C-26 (CONTRACTS citation sequence). Independence of the two new v9 structure criteria confirmed when both fail simultaneously without cascading to C-19, C-24, or any other criterion.

### CONTRACTS

The following contracts define all key invariants for this skill. All phases reference these by name. Rules are stated once, here, authoritatively.

---

#### CONTRACT: INPUT-ROUTING-RULES

Apply before mode detection. Classify the input:

| Pattern | Classification | Action |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Single word, no colon | BARE AREA | Ask "Which subrole in `{area}`? Provide `{area}:{subrole}` or a description." Stop. |
| More than one `:` | EXTRA COLONS | Use first two tokens as area:subrole. Notify user. Continue. |
| Natural language, no colon, no quotes, <= 4 words | VAGUE PHRASE | Ask "Did you mean `area:subrole`, a description in quotes, or interactive mode?" Stop. |
| No argument | EMPTY | Route to INTERACTIVE. Continue. |
| `word:word`, quoted string, or confirmed EMPTY | CLEAN INPUT | Continue to mode detection. |

---

#### CONTRACT: INTERACTIVE-HOLD

These are categorical prohibitions, not preferences:
- **Do not generate any content after receiving only one or two answers.**
- **Do not produce a draft, stub, or partial frontmatter mid-conversation.**
- **Do not proceed until all three answers are confirmed.**

Three required questions, in sequence:
1. "What area? (e.g., `backend`, `design`, `data`)"
2. "What subrole name? (e.g., `healthcare`, `payments`, `accessibility`)"
3. "One sentence describing what this role focuses on."

---

#### CONTRACT: COLUMN-HEADER

Body table column headers must use domain vocabulary.

| Verdict | Example |
|---------|---------|

### PHASES

---

#### PHASE 0 -- Input Guard

The input guard resolves ambiguous or malformed inputs before the routing pipeline proceeds. Apply CONTRACT: INPUT-ROUTING-RULES.

If input is BARE AREA or VAGUE PHRASE: ask the clarifying question from the contract. Do not proceed to Phase 1 until the user responds with a clean input.

-> **Gate 0 [G]:** CONTRACT: INPUT-ROUTING-RULES applied. Input classified as clean or resolved. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 1 -- Mode Detection

With clean input confirmed, the mode is identified and the appropriate path selected.

- **NAME-ONLY** (`area:subrole`): extract area and subrole. Proceed.
- **DESCRIPTION** (quoted string): derive area and subrole. Proceed.
- **INTERACTIVE** (empty / confirmed EMPTY from Phase 0): apply CONTRACT: INTERACTIVE-HOLD. Ask three questions in sequence. Proceed only when all three are answered.

-> **Gate 1:** area and subrole known and non-empty (or all three interactive answers confirmed). PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 2 -- Inertia-Advocate Check

Before generating the requested role, the companion check ensures the area's status-quo voice is present. Check whether `.craft/roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md` exists.

- **ABSENT:** Apply CONTRACT: INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE. Generate companion file content. Substitute all `{area}` slots. Store in working memory. Do not write yet. If any gate fails, fix and re-check before advancing.

  -> **Gate 2a [H]:** Companion file content generated with no literal `{area}` remaining. PASS / FAIL
  -> **Gate 2b:** Companion file path confirmed as `.craft/roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md`. PASS / FAIL

- **PRESENT:** Continue to Phase 3.

---

#### PHASE 3 -- Generate Frontmatter

With area, subrole, and companion status resolved, generate the role's YAML frontmatter. Apply CONTRACT: FIELD-REGISTER. Generate all 12 required fields for `.craft/roles/{area}/{subrole}.md`. If any gate fails, fix the failing field and re-check the gate before advancing to Phase 4.

-> **Gate 3a [B]:** All 12 fields present in the generated frontmatter. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 3b [C]:** orientation.frame passes CONTRACT: FIELD-REGISTER (first-person observational). PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 3c [D]:** orientation.serves passes CONTRACT: FIELD-REGISTER (names specific beneficiary). PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 3d [E]:** Each lens.verify item passes CONTRACT: FIELD-REGISTER (specific artifact/state/config); minimum 4 items. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 3e:** No placeholder text remains in the generated frontmatter. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 4 -- Generate Body

With frontmatter complete, generate the markdown body section that grounds the role in its domain. Apply CONTRACT: COLUMN-HEADER. Write the `## {Subrole} Domain` heading followed by a domain specializations table with domain-vocabulary column headers. Minimum 3 rows. If any gate fails, revise the table before advancing.

-> **Gate 4a:** Body contains a domain specializations table. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 4b [F]:** Column headers pass CONTRACT: COLUMN-HEADER (no generic terms). PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 4c:** Table contains at least 3 domain-specific rows. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 5 -- Pre-Write Confirmation

All items in CONTRACT: AUDIT-CHECKLIST have been gated at their respective phases. Confirm each is resolved:

```
[A] Path correctness: .craft/roles/{area}/{subrole}.md confirmed? ___
[B] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- frontmatter completeness -- confirmed Gate 3a? ___
[C] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- orientation.frame -- confirmed Gate 3b? ___
[D] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- orientation.serves -- confirmed Gate 3c? ___
[E] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- lens.verify -- confirmed Gate 3d? ___
[F] COLUMN-HEADER compliance -- body table -- confirmed Gate 4b? ___
[G] INPUT-ROUTING-RULES compliance -- confirmed Gate 0? ___
[H] If inertia-advocate generated: INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE compliance -- confirmed Gate 2a? ___ (N/A if already existed)
```

All items must show YES (or N/A for H). Any NO = identify the failed gate, fix, re-check the phase gate, return here.

---

#### PHASE 6 -- Write Files

Write in order:
1. If companion generated in Phase 2: `.craft/roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md`
2. Main role: `.craft/roles/{area}/{subrole}.md`

Confirm both paths in output.

---

### V-05: Full Ceiling (R9 V-05 Confirmed Against v9)

**Axis:** R10 ceiling. R9 V-05 carried forward without modification. This is the only R9 variation confirmed to pass all three new v9 criteria: C-24 (consistent inline gates throughout -- no table gate anywhere), C-25 (minimum phase surface -- each phase body is one CONTRACT citation + one artifact reference, no bridging prose), and C-26 (CONTRACTS in canonical first-citation sequence: INPUT-ROUTING-RULES before INTERACTIVE-HOLD before FIELD-REGISTER before COLUMN-HEADER before INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE before AUDIT-CHECKLIST, matching Phase 0/1/3/4/2/5 first-citation order). All 26 criteria pass.

**Hypothesis:** 100. No criterion fails. V-01 through V-04 probe single and paired C-24/C-25/C-26 violations; V-05 is the proven canonical form that isolates each failure. Any criterion that V-05 passes but another variation fails is attributable to that variation's structural change. If any R10 variation scores unexpectedly, V-05 serves as the control.

**v9 new criteria status:** C-24 PASS (all inline gates), C-25 PASS (minimum phase surface), C-26 PASS (canonical CONTRACTS ordering). V-05 is the only known form that passes all three simultaneously.

#### PHASE 5 -- Pre-Write Confirmation

All items in CONTRACT: AUDIT-CHECKLIST have been gated at their respective phases. Confirm each is resolved:

```
[A] Path correctness: .craft/roles/{area}/{subrole}.md confirmed? ___
[B] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- frontmatter completeness -- confirmed Gate 3a? ___
[C] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- orientation.frame -- confirmed Gate 3b? ___
[D] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- orientation.serves -- confirmed Gate 3c? ___
[E] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- lens.verify -- confirmed Gate 3d? ___
[F] COLUMN-HEADER compliance -- body table -- confirmed Gate 4b? ___
[G] INPUT-ROUTING-RULES compliance -- confirmed Gate 0? ___
[H] If inertia-advocate generated: INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE compliance -- confirmed Gate 2a? ___ (N/A if already existed)
```

All items must show YES (or N/A for H). Any NO = identify the failed gate, fix, re-check the phase gate, return here.

#### PHASE 6 -- Write Files

Write in order:
1. If companion generated in Phase 2: `.craft/roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md`
2. Main role: `.craft/roles/{area}/{subrole}.md`

Confirm both paths in output.

### R10 Design Notes

**C-24 is the sharpest criterion (V-01):** The single-gate-table exception in Phase 0 tests whether C-24 fires on minimum exposure. Phase 0 uses a table; Phases 2/3/4 use inline. C-15 and C-18 continue to pass (table gates are format-neutral for distributed placement and bidirectionality). C-24 fires because consistency of form across all content-producing phases is the requirement -- one exception is sufficient for failure.

**C-25 tightens C-19 but does not replace it (V-02):** The bridging prose in V-02 phase bodies is designed to be C-19-safe: no rule content from any CONTRACT block appears in the added sentences. "With clean input confirmed, the mode is identified" does not paraphrase any INPUT-ROUTING-RULES rule. "If any gate fails, fix and re-check before advancing" does not enumerate any FIELD-REGISTER validation rule. C-19 passes. C-25 fires because the minimum surface is exceeded regardless of whether the excess prose restates rules.

**C-26 applies to adjacent main-flow pairs (V-03):** FIELD-REGISTER and COLUMN-HEADER are both unconditionally executed main-flow contracts (Phase 3 and Phase 4 respectively). Swapping them puts Phase-4-cited COLUMN-HEADER before Phase-3-cited FIELD-REGISTER. This is a clear first-citation sequence violation. The V-03 probe differs from R9's V-03 (which displaced INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE to absolute first position) by testing whether C-26 fires on a minimal adjacent swap within the unconditional main flow.

**C-25 and C-26 are independent (V-04):** Failing both adds exactly 2 x (10/19) = 1.05 pts to the deduction. No cascade: C-25 governs phase body surface area, C-26 governs CONTRACTS block ordering -- different structural dimensions of the skill. A scorer who accepts V-04 at 98.95 confirms the independence hypothesis; any score other than 98.95 would indicate either criterion cascades or interacts with a third.

**V-05 is the R10 baseline (V-05):** R9 V-05 carried forward unchanged. If the scorer finds any R10 variation deviates from its hypothesis, comparing against V-05 isolates which criterion caused the deviation.
