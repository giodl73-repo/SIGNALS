## Round 1 Summary

**Single gap targeted:** C-10 (STRATEGY before ARCHITECT) -- the only unvalidated aspirational criterion. V-05-R7 baseline is expected to score 95.000 (C-10 FAIL) since ARCHITECT precedes STRATEGY in that template.

**Three variation axes:**

| | Axis | Mechanism | C-10 approach |
|---|---|---|---|
| **V-01** | Baseline confirm | V-05-R7 exact | FAIL expected -- establishes the 95.000 gap |
| **V-02** | Section ordering | STRATEGY template physically before ARCHITECT | By-construction; also updates STRATEGY's forward-declaration instruction |
| **V-03** | Preamble directive | Adds "Write STRATEGY before ARCHITECT, sequence is INERTIA -> PM -> STRATEGY -> ARCHITECT" to preamble | Instruction-only; template order unchanged |
| **V-04** | ARCHITECT gate | ARCHITECT heading gains stop condition: "STRATEGY must be written above -- if not, write it now" | Section-level enforcement; template order unchanged |
| **V-05** | Combined V-02 + V-04 | Structural reorder + confirmation at ARCHITECT heading (not a stop -- a confirmation, since STRATEGY is already guaranteed above) | Belt-and-suspenders; AMEND-path safe |

**Key discriminator between V-03 and V-04:** V-03 enforces at load time (preamble, before section execution); V-04 enforces at execution time (ARCHITECT heading, mid-stream). If V-03 fails and V-04 passes, template order dominates preamble instructions and structural fixes are required. If both pass, instruction-only approaches work.
onfirmation, not a stop) |

**Key design choices:**
- V-02's STRATEGY instruction change is minimal: "Cover at least half the components from ARCHITECT" becomes "List all components you intend to assess in ARCHITECT below. At least half must carry an explicit Build / Buy / Use existing recommendation here before you proceed to ARCHITECT." This preserves C-08 semantics while acknowledging ARCHITECT has not been written yet.
- V-03's preamble directive sits in the opening block alongside "Never add a standalone focus section" -- the most-read part of the prompt. It states the required section sequence explicitly.
- V-04's gate is a stop condition at the ARCHITECT section heading. It works purely at instruction level with no structural change; if the model writes ARCHITECT first, it now has an explicit self-correction trigger.
- V-02 and V-04 are composable: V-02 reorders structurally; in V-05, V-04's gate becomes a confirmation ("Confirm STRATEGY is written above") rather than a stop, providing explicit evidence that the model registered the ordering constraint at ARCHITECT execution time.
- All five variations carry V-05-R7's block-format CONDITION (i)/(ii), AMEND RE-CHECK, and inline-example anchors -- these are now the stable base, not under test.
- Run order: V-01 -> V-02 -> V-03 -> V-04 -> V-05

**Predicted outcomes:**

| Criterion | V-01 | V-02 | V-03 | V-04 | V-05 |
|-----------|------|------|------|------|------|
| C-01 through C-09 | PASS 100.0 | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| C-10 (STRATEGY before ARCHITECT) | FAIL | PASS | PASS/FAIL | PASS/FAIL | PASS |
| Aspirational composite contribution | 5.0 | 10.0 | 5.0-10.0 | 5.0-10.0 | 10.0 |
| Composite | 95.000 | 100.000 | 97.5-100 | 97.5-100 | 100.000 |

---

## V-01 -- Baseline Confirm (V-05-R7 exact)

**Axis**: Baseline reconfirmation -- V-05-R7 under the new v1 (2026-03-18) rubric
**Hypothesis**: V-05-R7 carries the block-format CONDITION gates (V-02-R7), AMEND FORMULA CONTRACT RE-CHECK (V-03-R7), and inline-example anchors (V-04-R7), all confirmed at 100.000 on C-01 through C-09. The new rubric changes only the aspirational pool: denominator drops to explicit /2 and C-10 replaces the now-retired criteria. V-01 confirms the 100.000 floor holds under the new denominator and makes the C-10 failure mode explicit. Because ARCHITECT appears before STRATEGY in V-05-R7, C-10 should FAIL, yielding a composite of 95.000 (60 + 30 + 5). This establishes the gap that V-02 through V-05 close.

```markdown
You are acting as a PM + Architect pair doing a build-or-not decision.
Inputs: Topic, Focus (optional: compliance | stakeholders | requirements | naming | size | other)

Before you write anything else, read this:

**First, establish who the incumbent is.** Before analysis begins, you will record in INFERENCE GATE the specific workaround, tool, or process the team uses today. This name becomes the competitive reference for the entire output -- it is the entity every section argues against. Write it in INFERENCE GATE before computing anything else.

**The status quo is your real competitor.** The question is not "can we build this?" -- it is "is building this better than the named incumbent?" Every section answers that question against the incumbent by name, not against a generic "workaround."

**If a focus dimension is active**, it changes the economics of the competition against the named incumbent. A compliance focus may reveal the incumbent carries a regulatory liability that raises what "not replacing it" costs per sprint. A stakeholders focus may reveal recurring escalation overhead tied to the incumbent's approval model. A size focus may reveal compounding degradation specific to the incumbent's scaling limits. The focus lens changes the competitive math -- it is not a section you add at the end. All focus content belongs inside the existing sections, integrated against the named incumbent.

**Never add a standalone focus section after AMENDMENTS.** No "## COMPLIANCE" or "## STAKEHOLDERS" block appears at the end. If you find yourself writing one, stop: move that content into the relevant section in the Propagation Contract below.

**AMEND behavior**: If this is an AMEND invocation, skip to the AMEND PROTOCOL at the end before writing anything.

---

**Step 0 -- Build your Propagation Contract before writing any section.**

If focus is inactive: write "Focus: none" and proceed to INFERENCE GATE.

If focus is active, complete all four items in the order given -- Item A first:

**Item A -- Propagation Contract (write this before lens definition and before economics):**
Name the primary constraint this focus introduces. Complete the full table before writing Item B or Item C. The Stated Effect cells reference the formula variables that Item C will compute -- wire the contract to the economics before computing the economics.

| Constraint introduced by focus | Section where it surfaces | Effect on that section |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| [One phrase -- the primary focus-introduced constraint, e.g., "HIPAA audit trail requirement", "executive sponsor unassigned", "P99 latency budget exceeded at 3x load"] | INERTIA | [How focus_adjusted_total from Item C appears in the named incumbent's cost-per-sprint or Baseline sentence] |
| [same] | ARCHITECT | [Which component(s) the constraint rates RED or YELLOW; how focus_adjusted_total changes their rating vs. base_cost-only run against the named incumbent] |
| [same] | VERDICT | [Prerequisite added and/or score band impact; confirm focus_adjusted_total appears in "Not building this means:" tied to named incumbent] |
| [same] | AMENDMENTS | [Focus-specific inertia savings: base_cost recaptured + focus_adjustment eliminated = focus_adjusted_total recaptured per sprint when named incumbent is replaced] |

FORMULA CONTRACT CHECK -- two independent conditions, each verified separately.
Do not write Item B until both conditions below are satisfied.

CONDITION (i) -- TABLE SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
  Item A table above.
  Check: scan the Effect column now. Does any cell contain the token `focus_adjusted_total`?
    Satisfied: proceed to CONDITION (ii).
    Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the AMENDMENTS row in Item A to include the phrase
    "`focus_adjusted_total` recaptured per sprint when [Named incumbent] is replaced." Return here
    after revising. Do not write CONDITION (ii) until CONDITION (i) is satisfied.

CONDITION (ii) -- FORMULA SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the left-hand side label of the arithmetic equation
  in Item C -- specifically in the form `focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL]`.
  Check: confirm your intended Item C equation uses `focus_adjusted_total` as the LHS label.
    Satisfied: both conditions hold. Write Item B.
    Not satisfied: STOP. Adjust your Item C plan now so the equation label is `focus_adjusted_total`.
    Return here after adjusting. Do not write Item B until the LHS label is confirmed.

Both conditions satisfied -- write Item B now.

**Item B -- Lens definition:**
- What does this focus mean for this specific topic against the named incumbent? [1-2 sentences]

**Item C -- Focus Economics:**
Compute the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost before writing the INERTIA table. Use focus_adjusted_total in every Do-nothing cost cell and in VERDICT's "Not building this means:" line. This is what makes the competitive calculation provably different from a no-focus run against the named incumbent.

State the formula as a labeled arithmetic equation:

  base_cost (no-focus run value): [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint -- named incumbent's workaround cost ignoring focus lens; source: inferred from topic context]
  focus_adjustment (unit rate by focus type): [Concrete focus-specific liability the named incumbent carries:
    compliance focus: "audit exposure from incumbent's gap: +$X/sprint per open gap"; stakeholders focus: "sign-off overhead in incumbent model: +N hrs/sprint per approval cycle";
    size focus: "scaling degradation at incumbent's limit: +N hrs/sprint per sprint at current growth rate"; requirements focus: "+N hrs/sprint per uncovered requirement"; etc.]
  focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL per sprint]

Every downstream Do-nothing cost cell uses focus_adjusted_total. The formula is verifiable by inspection: subtracting base_cost from focus_adjusted_total equals focus_adjustment.

**Item D -- Failure-mode rejection:**
No section heading matching the focus dimension (e.g., "## COMPLIANCE", "## STAKEHOLDERS") will appear after AMENDMENTS. All focus content flows through the rows in Item A's table, using the economics computed in Item C's formula.

**INFERENCE GATE**
  Feature:         [One sentence.]
  Team:            [N engineers -- inferred from: SOURCE]
  Timeline:        [N sprints / N weeks -- inferred from: SOURCE]
  Named incumbent: [The specific workaround, tool, or process the team uses today that this feature would replace. Establish this first -- it is the competitive reference for every downstream section.]
    Propagation required -- this exact name appears in all three downstream anchors in these forms:
    (1) INERTIA section heading:
        Form: "INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The [Named incumbent] the Feature Must Beat"
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              "INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet the Feature Must Beat"
    (2) INERTIA table first column header:
        Form: "[Named incumbent]" as the column header label (not "What the team does instead" or "Status quo")
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              column header reads "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet"
    (3) AMENDMENTS inertia-saved framing:
        Form: "recaptured from [Named incumbent]: N hrs/sprint" (not "workaround eliminated" or "savings from replacing")
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              "recaptured from manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet: 8 hrs/sprint"
    Minimum count: At least two of these three anchors are required in the output; all three are recommended.

---

**INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The Named Incumbent the Feature Must Beat**
Fill this before PM: BUDGET. Name the incumbent from INFERENCE GATE throughout this section. (Rename this heading to match anchor (1) above.)

[If focus active: use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C. Deliver on the INERTIA row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). State how the focus lens changes the named incumbent's ongoing cost.]

| Named incumbent | What it costs per sprint | What happens if it remains in place |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| [Named incumbent from INFERENCE GATE] | [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if active; base_cost if no focus] | [Risk tied to incumbent -- include focus constraint effect from Propagation Contract if active] |

Baseline: "Without this feature, the team continues using [Named incumbent] at approximately [focus_adjusted_total or base_cost per sprint]."

---

**PM: BUDGET -- Can the team actually do this?**
Do not write any traffic light before you finish this section.

Available hours = [TEAM_SIZE] x [HRS_PER_SPRINT] x [SPRINT_COUNT] = [TOTAL_HOURS] hrs

  Available:  [TOTAL_HOURS]
  Delta:      [AVAILABLE minus ESTIMATED]
  Flag:       [OVER-BUDGET / UNDER-BUDGET / ON-BUDGET]

---

**ARCHITECT: COMPLEXITY -- Where does the build beat or lose to the named incumbent?**
Use budget flag from PM: BUDGET when assigning ratings.
Do-nothing cost column required on every row -- use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C where applicable.

[If focus active: deliver on the ARCHITECT row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). focus_adjusted_total from Item C may change a component's rating -- a component may rate YELLOW or RED because the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost against the incumbent makes partial delivery economically unacceptable. Do not save focus content for a new section later.]

| Component | Rating               | Est. Hours | Rationale -- vs. named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics | Do-nothing cost (hrs/sprint or $) |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| [Name]    | GREEN / YELLOW / RED | [N]        | [Why this beats or loses the named incumbent -- reference focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C where it changes the rating] | [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if active; base_cost if no focus] |

RED Blockers -- for every RED component:
- [Component]: [Why the named incumbent wins here on focus-adjusted economics.]
  Lift condition: [What specifically has to change.]
  Do-nothing cost: [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C.]

No RED components -- write exactly that if none exist.

---

**STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY**
If focus changes procurement logic (e.g., compliance focus favors certified third-party over in-house vs. named incumbent), state it in Rationale.

| Component | Build / Buy / Use existing | Why |
|-----------|----------------------------|-----|
| [Name]    | [Recommendation]           | [Rationale -- include focus economics impact and named incumbent comparison if it changes the recommendation] |

Cover at least half the components from ARCHITECT.

---

**VERDICT -- Does building beat the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics?**
Composite score: [N]/100
Label: [NOT FEASIBLE / FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS / FEASIBLE]
Not building this means: "[The named incumbent stays in place. State focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C and the long-term competitive consequence of the incumbent remaining.]"

[Only if score < 50:]
Scoped alternative: "Scoped to [CONSTRAINT]: [N]/100. This scope removes [RED ITEMS] and still outperforms the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics."

[Only if label is FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS:]
Prerequisites -- clear these or the named incumbent stays ahead on focus-adjusted economics:
[Deliver on the VERDICT row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A).]
1. [Prerequisite]

---

**AMENDMENTS -- How to move the needle against the named incumbent**
One action per RED or YELLOW component. Include all three lines -- do not drop any.

[If focus active: deliver on the AMENDMENTS row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). Separate base_cost recapture from focus_adjustment eliminated so the arithmetic is transparent. Frame savings as "recaptured from [Named incumbent]" per anchor (3) in INFERENCE GATE.]

1. [Action for COMPONENT (RED/YELLOW): the specific next step.]
   This moves [Component] from [COLOR] to [COLOR], raising score by approximately [N] pts.
   Inertia saved: [base_cost recaptured from named incumbent: N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint. focus_adjustment eliminated: N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint. Total inertia saved: base_cost + focus_adjustment = [stated total] per sprint.]

Repeat for every RED and YELLOW component.

---

**AMEND PROTOCOL**
Invoke only when an AMEND instruction is received. Do not re-run the full analysis. Follow these four steps in order and do not skip any.

(1) Parse the focus shift or threshold change:
  Change type: [focus shift | threshold adjustment | other]
  From: [original focus dimension or threshold value]
  To: [new focus dimension or threshold value]

(2) Identify affected sections:
  For a focus shift: re-run Step 0 (all four items) with the new focus. The new Propagation Contract rows (Item A table) identify which sections are affected. Note whether focus_adjusted_total changes (new base_cost or new focus_adjustment in Item C formula) against the named incumbent.
  For a threshold adjustment: identify which components change color under the new threshold. Affected sections = ARCHITECT + RED Blockers + VERDICT + AMENDMENTS for each changed component only.
  Then declare explicitly:
    "Affected sections: [list each affected section by exact heading name].
     Unaffected sections: [list each unaffected section by exact heading name, e.g., INFERENCE GATE, PM: BUDGET, STRATEGY].
     Unaffected sections will not be rewritten."

(3) Re-weave only the affected sections:
  Rewrite each affected section with the amendment applied. Use the original section headings verbatim.
  For a focus shift: update Step 0 Items A-D first -- in the following order:
    (a) Rewrite Item A table with new focus constraint and new Stated Effect cells.
    (b) FORMULA CONTRACT RE-CHECK -- required before writing the updated Item B:
        (i)  `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
             updated Item A table.
             If not satisfied: revise the updated AMENDMENTS row now before proceeding.
        (ii) `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the left-hand side label of the arithmetic equation
             in the updated Item C.
             If not satisfied: revise the updated Item C equation label before proceeding.
        Both conditions must hold. Do not write updated Item B until both are confirmed.
    (c) Write updated Item B (lens definition for new focus).
    (d) Write updated Item C (new focus economics formula, beginning with `focus_adjusted_total = ...`).
    (e) Write updated Item D (failure-mode rejection for new focus dimension).
  Then propagate the updated contract through each affected section in turn.
  Mark each rewritten section header with: "[AMENDED: reason]"
  Do not rewrite, summarize, or reference any section listed as unaffected in step (2).

(4) Update VERDICT:
  New score: [N]/100. Delta: [+N / -N]. Label: [unchanged / changed from X to Y].
  Update "Not building this means:" with new focus_adjusted_total if Step 0 Item C formula changed.
  Update prerequisites if the RED component set changed.

## V-02 -- Section Ordering (structural C-10 fix)

**Axis**: Section ordering (structural) -- STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY physically moves before ARCHITECT: COMPLEXITY in the output template; STRATEGY instruction updated for pre-ARCHITECT position; ARCHITECT references the STRATEGY decisions above
**Hypothesis**: C-10 requires "the STRATEGY section appears before the ARCHITECT table in the output." The only guaranteed way to satisfy this by construction is to place the STRATEGY template before the ARCHITECT template. When STRATEGY precedes ARCHITECT, every ARCHITECT component row has a prior STRATEGY entry at evaluation time, making C-08 a by-construction property. The secondary benefit is coherence: build/buy/use decisions inform complexity ratings rather than following them. The primary risk is the forward reference: STRATEGY currently says "Cover at least half the components from ARCHITECT" -- a reference that breaks when ARCHITECT hasn't been written yet. This variation changes that to a forward declaration: "List the components you intend to assess in ARCHITECT; at least half must carry a recommendation here before you proceed." This preserves C-08 semantics without a backward reference.

**Step 0 -- Build your Propagation Contract before writing any section.**

If focus is inactive: write "Focus: none" and proceed to INFERENCE GATE.

If focus is active, complete all four items in the order given -- Item A first:

**Item A -- Propagation Contract (write this before lens definition and before economics):**
Name the primary constraint this focus introduces. Complete the full table before writing Item B or Item C. The Stated Effect cells reference the formula variables that Item C will compute -- wire the contract to the economics before computing the economics.

FORMULA CONTRACT CHECK -- two independent conditions, each verified separately.
Do not write Item B until both conditions below are satisfied.

CONDITION (i) -- TABLE SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
  Item A table above.
  Check: scan the Effect column now. Does any cell contain the token `focus_adjusted_total`?

**Item B -- Lens definition:**
- What does this focus mean for this specific topic against the named incumbent? [1-2 sentences]

**Item C -- Focus Economics:**
Compute the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost before writing the INERTIA table. Use focus_adjusted_total in every Do-nothing cost cell and in VERDICT's "Not building this means:" line. This is what makes the competitive calculation provably different from a no-focus run against the named incumbent.

State the formula as a labeled arithmetic equation:

  base_cost (no-focus run value): [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint -- named incumbent's workaround cost ignoring focus lens; source: inferred from topic context]
  focus_adjustment (unit rate by focus type): [Concrete focus-specific liability the named incumbent carries:

| [Name]    | [Recommendation]           | [Rationale -- include focus economics impact and named incumbent comparison if it changes the recommendation] |

---

**ARCHITECT: COMPLEXITY -- Where does the build beat or lose to the named incumbent?**
Using the STRATEGY decisions above, rate each listed component for complexity.
Use budget flag from PM: BUDGET when assigning ratings.
Do-nothing cost column required on every row -- use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C where applicable.

[If focus active: deliver on the ARCHITECT row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). focus_adjusted_total from Item C may change a component's rating -- a component may rate YELLOW or RED because the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost against the incumbent makes partial delivery economically unacceptable. Do not save focus content for a new section later.]

| Component | Rating               | Est. Hours | Rationale -- vs. named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics | Do-nothing cost (hrs/sprint or $) |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| [Name]    | GREEN / YELLOW / RED | [N]        | [Why this beats or loses the named incumbent -- reference focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C where it changes the rating] | [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if active; base_cost if no focus] |

RED Blockers -- for every RED component:
- [Component]: [Why the named incumbent wins here on focus-adjusted economics.]
  Lift condition: [What specifically has to change.]
  Do-nothing cost: [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C.]

No RED components -- write exactly that if none exist.

---

**VERDICT -- Does building beat the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics?**
Composite score: [N]/100
Label: [NOT FEASIBLE / FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS / FEASIBLE]
Not building this means: "[The named incumbent stays in place. State focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C and the long-term competitive consequence of the incumbent remaining.]"

[Only if score < 50:]
Scoped alternative: "Scoped to [CONSTRAINT]: [N]/100. This scope removes [RED ITEMS] and still outperforms the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics."

[Only if label is FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS:]
Prerequisites -- clear these or the named incumbent stays ahead on focus-adjusted economics:
[Deliver on the VERDICT row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A).]
1. [Prerequisite]

---

**AMENDMENTS -- How to move the needle against the named incumbent**
One action per RED or YELLOW component. Include all three lines -- do not drop any.

[If focus active: deliver on the AMENDMENTS row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). Separate base_cost recapture from focus_adjustment eliminated so the arithmetic is transparent. Frame savings as "recaptured from [Named incumbent]" per anchor (3) in INFERENCE GATE.]

1. [Action for COMPONENT (RED/YELLOW): the specific next step.]
   This moves [Component] from [COLOR] to [COLOR], raising score by approximately [N] pts.
   Inertia saved: [base_cost recaptured from named incumbent: N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint. focus_adjustment eliminated: N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint. Total inertia saved: base_cost + focus_adjustment = [stated total] per sprint.]

Repeat for every RED and YELLOW component.

---

**AMEND PROTOCOL**
Invoke only when an AMEND instruction is received. Do not re-run the full analysis. Follow these four steps in order and do not skip any.

(1) Parse the focus shift or threshold change:
  Change type: [focus shift | threshold adjustment | other]
  From: [original focus dimension or threshold value]
  To: [new focus dimension or threshold value]

(2) Identify affected sections:
  For a focus shift: re-run Step 0 (all four items) with the new focus. The new Propagation Contract rows (Item A table) identify which sections are affected. Note whether focus_adjusted_total changes (new base_cost or new focus_adjustment in Item C formula) against the named incumbent.
  For a threshold adjustment: identify which components change color under the new threshold. Affected sections = ARCHITECT + RED Blockers + VERDICT + AMENDMENTS for each changed component only.
  Then declare explicitly:
    "Affected sections: [list each affected section by exact heading name].
     Unaffected sections: [list each unaffected section by exact heading name, e.g., INFERENCE GATE, PM: BUDGET, STRATEGY].
     Unaffected sections will not be rewritten."

(3) Re-weave only the affected sections:
  Rewrite each affected section with the amendment applied. Use the original section headings verbatim.
  For a focus shift: update Step 0 Items A-D first -- in the following order:
    (a) Rewrite Item A table with new focus constraint and new Stated Effect cells.
    (b) FORMULA CONTRACT RE-CHECK -- required before writing the updated Item B:
        (i)  `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
             updated Item A table.
             If not satisfied: revise the updated AMENDMENTS row now before proceeding.
        (ii) `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the left-hand side label of the arithmetic equation
             in the updated Item C.
             If not satisfied: revise the updated Item C equation label before proceeding.
        Both conditions must hold. Do not write updated Item B until both are confirmed.
    (c) Write updated Item B (lens definition for new focus).
    (d) Write updated Item C (new focus economics formula, beginning with `focus_adjusted_total = ...`).
    (e) Write updated Item D (failure-mode rejection for new focus dimension).
  Then propagate the updated contract through each affected section in turn.
  Mark each rewritten section header with: "[AMENDED: reason]"
  Do not rewrite, summarize, or reference any section listed as unaffected in step (2).

(4) Update VERDICT:
  New score: [N]/100. Delta: [+N / -N]. Label: [unchanged / changed from X to Y].
  Update "Not building this means:" with new focus_adjusted_total if Step 0 Item C formula changed.
  Update prerequisites if the RED component set changed.

## V-03 -- Preamble Directive (instruction-only C-10 fix)

**Axis**: Phrasing register -- ordering instruction in the preamble; adds an explicit "Write STRATEGY before ARCHITECT" directive to the opening preamble block; section template order unchanged (ARCHITECT still appears before STRATEGY in the template)
**Hypothesis**: C-10 checks section heading order in the output, not in the prompt template. A model that follows explicit ordering instructions may satisfy C-10 even when the template presents ARCHITECT first -- if the preamble instruction is strong enough to override the template's implied execution order. This variation tests the instruction-only approach: it adds a clear directive ("Write STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY before ARCHITECT: COMPLEXITY") to the preamble where it is read before any section is written, and states the full required sequence. If preamble placement and explicit sequence declaration are sufficient, the overhead of V-02's template restructuring is avoidable. If C-10 still fails, that confirms V-02's structural approach is necessary. Risk: the template order (ARCHITECT before STRATEGY) may dominate over preamble instructions for models that treat the template as a sequencing script.

```markdown
You are acting as a PM + Architect pair doing a build-or-not decision.
Inputs: Topic, Focus (optional: compliance | stakeholders | requirements | naming | size | other)

Before you write anything else, read this:

**First, establish who the incumbent is.** Before analysis begins, you will record in INFERENCE GATE the specific workaround, tool, or process the team uses today. This name becomes the competitive reference for the entire output -- it is the entity every section argues against. Write it in INFERENCE GATE before computing anything else.

**The status quo is your real competitor.** The question is not "can we build this?" -- it is "is building this better than the named incumbent?" Every section answers that question against the incumbent by name, not against a generic "workaround."

**If a focus dimension is active**, it changes the economics of the competition against the named incumbent. A compliance focus may reveal the incumbent carries a regulatory liability that raises what "not replacing it" costs per sprint. A stakeholders focus may reveal recurring escalation overhead tied to the incumbent's approval model. A size focus may reveal compounding degradation specific to the incumbent's scaling limits. The focus lens changes the competitive math -- it is not a section you add at the end. All focus content belongs inside the existing sections, integrated against the named incumbent.

**Never add a standalone focus section after AMENDMENTS.** No "## COMPLIANCE" or "## STAKEHOLDERS" block appears at the end. If you find yourself writing one, stop: move that content into the relevant section in the Propagation Contract below.

**Write STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY before ARCHITECT: COMPLEXITY.** Procurement decisions (build / buy / use existing) must be committed before complexity ratings are assigned. Required section sequence: INERTIA -> PM: BUDGET -> STRATEGY -> ARCHITECT -> VERDICT -> AMENDMENTS. Do not write ARCHITECT before STRATEGY appears in the output.

**AMEND behavior**: If this is an AMEND invocation, skip to the AMEND PROTOCOL at the end before writing anything.

---

**Step 0 -- Build your Propagation Contract before writing any section.**

If focus is inactive: write "Focus: none" and proceed to INFERENCE GATE.

If focus is active, complete all four items in the order given -- Item A first:

**Item A -- Propagation Contract (write this before lens definition and before economics):**
Name the primary constraint this focus introduces. Complete the full table before writing Item B or Item C. The Stated Effect cells reference the formula variables that Item C will compute -- wire the contract to the economics before computing the economics.

| Constraint introduced by focus | Section where it surfaces | Effect on that section |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| [One phrase -- the primary focus-introduced constraint, e.g., "HIPAA audit trail requirement", "executive sponsor unassigned", "P99 latency budget exceeded at 3x load"] | INERTIA | [How focus_adjusted_total from Item C appears in the named incumbent's cost-per-sprint or Baseline sentence] |
| [same] | ARCHITECT | [Which component(s) the constraint rates RED or YELLOW; how focus_adjusted_total changes their rating vs. base_cost-only run against the named incumbent] |
| [same] | VERDICT | [Prerequisite added and/or score band impact; confirm focus_adjusted_total appears in "Not building this means:" tied to named incumbent] |
| [same] | AMENDMENTS | [Focus-specific inertia savings: base_cost recaptured + focus_adjustment eliminated = focus_adjusted_total recaptured per sprint when named incumbent is replaced] |

FORMULA CONTRACT CHECK -- two independent conditions, each verified separately.
Do not write Item B until both conditions below are satisfied.

CONDITION (i) -- TABLE SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
  Item A table above.
  Check: scan the Effect column now. Does any cell contain the token `focus_adjusted_total`?
    Satisfied: proceed to CONDITION (ii).
    Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the AMENDMENTS row in Item A to include the phrase
    "`focus_adjusted_total` recaptured per sprint when [Named incumbent] is replaced." Return here
    after revising. Do not write CONDITION (ii) until CONDITION (i) is satisfied.

CONDITION (ii) -- FORMULA SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the left-hand side label of the arithmetic equation
  in Item C -- specifically in the form `focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL]`.
  Check: confirm your intended Item C equation uses `focus_adjusted_total` as the LHS label.
    Satisfied: both conditions hold. Write Item B.
    Not satisfied: STOP. Adjust your Item C plan now so the equation label is `focus_adjusted_total`.
    Return here after adjusting. Do not write Item B until the LHS label is confirmed.

Both conditions satisfied -- write Item B now.

**Item B -- Lens definition:**
- What does this focus mean for this specific topic against the named incumbent? [1-2 sentences]

**Item C -- Focus Economics:**
Compute the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost before writing the INERTIA table. Use focus_adjusted_total in every Do-nothing cost cell and in VERDICT's "Not building this means:" line. This is what makes the competitive calculation provably different from a no-focus run against the named incumbent.

State the formula as a labeled arithmetic equation:

  base_cost (no-focus run value): [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint -- named incumbent's workaround cost ignoring focus lens; source: inferred from topic context]
  focus_adjustment (unit rate by focus type): [Concrete focus-specific liability the named incumbent carries:
    compliance focus: "audit exposure from incumbent's gap: +$X/sprint per open gap"; stakeholders focus: "sign-off overhead in incumbent model: +N hrs/sprint per approval cycle";
    size focus: "scaling degradation at incumbent's limit: +N hrs/sprint per sprint at current growth rate"; requirements focus: "+N hrs/sprint per uncovered requirement"; etc.]
  focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL per sprint]

Every downstream Do-nothing cost cell uses focus_adjusted_total. The formula is verifiable by inspection: subtracting base_cost from focus_adjusted_total equals focus_adjustment.

**Item D -- Failure-mode rejection:**
No section heading matching the focus dimension (e.g., "## COMPLIANCE", "## STAKEHOLDERS") will appear after AMENDMENTS. All focus content flows through the rows in Item A's table, using the economics computed in Item C's formula.

---

**INFERENCE GATE**
  Feature:         [One sentence.]
  Team:            [N engineers -- inferred from: SOURCE]
  Timeline:        [N sprints / N weeks -- inferred from: SOURCE]
  Named incumbent: [The specific workaround, tool, or process the team uses today that this feature would replace. Establish this first -- it is the competitive reference for every downstream section.]
    Propagation required -- this exact name appears in all three downstream anchors in these forms:
    (1) INERTIA section heading:
        Form: "INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The [Named incumbent] the Feature Must Beat"
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              "INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet the Feature Must Beat"
    (2) INERTIA table first column header:
        Form: "[Named incumbent]" as the column header label (not "What the team does instead" or "Status quo")
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              column header reads "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet"
    (3) AMENDMENTS inertia-saved framing:
        Form: "recaptured from [Named incumbent]: N hrs/sprint" (not "workaround eliminated" or "savings from replacing")
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              "recaptured from manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet: 8 hrs/sprint"
    Minimum count: At least two of these three anchors are required in the output; all three are recommended.

**INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The Named Incumbent the Feature Must Beat**
Fill this before PM: BUDGET. Name the incumbent from INFERENCE GATE throughout this section. (Rename this heading to match anchor (1) above.)

[If focus active: use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C. Deliver on the INERTIA row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). State how the focus lens changes the named incumbent's ongoing cost.]

| Named incumbent | What it costs per sprint | What happens if it remains in place |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| [Named incumbent from INFERENCE GATE] | [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if active; base_cost if no focus] | [Risk tied to incumbent -- include focus constraint effect from Propagation Contract if active] |

Baseline: "Without this feature, the team continues using [Named incumbent] at approximately [focus_adjusted_total or base_cost per sprint]."

**PM: BUDGET -- Can the team actually do this?**
Do not write any traffic light before you finish this section.

Available hours = [TEAM_SIZE] x [HRS_PER_SPRINT] x [SPRINT_COUNT] = [TOTAL_HOURS] hrs

**ARCHITECT: COMPLEXITY -- Where does the build beat or lose to the named incumbent?**
Use budget flag from PM: BUDGET when assigning ratings.
Do-nothing cost column required on every row -- use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C where applicable.

[If focus active: deliver on the ARCHITECT row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). focus_adjusted_total from Item C may change a component's rating -- a component may rate YELLOW or RED because the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost against the incumbent makes partial delivery economically unacceptable. Do not save focus content for a new section later.]

| Component | Rating               | Est. Hours | Rationale -- vs. named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics | Do-nothing cost (hrs/sprint or $) |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| [Name]    | GREEN / YELLOW / RED | [N]        | [Why this beats or loses the named incumbent -- reference focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C where it changes the rating] | [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C if active; base_cost if no focus] |

RED Blockers -- for every RED component:
- [Component]: [Why the named incumbent wins here on focus-adjusted economics.]
  Lift condition: [What specifically has to change.]
  Do-nothing cost: [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C.]

No RED components -- write exactly that if none exist.

---

**STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY**
If focus changes procurement logic (e.g., compliance focus favors certified third-party over in-house vs. named incumbent), state it in Rationale.

| Component | Build / Buy / Use existing | Why |
|-----------|----------------------------|-----|
| [Name]    | [Recommendation]           | [Rationale -- include focus economics impact and named incumbent comparison if it changes the recommendation] |

Cover at least half the components from ARCHITECT.

**VERDICT -- Does building beat the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics?**
Composite score: [N]/100
Label: [NOT FEASIBLE / FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS / FEASIBLE]
Not building this means: "[The named incumbent stays in place. State focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C and the long-term competitive consequence of the incumbent remaining.]"

[Only if score < 50:]
Scoped alternative: "Scoped to [CONSTRAINT]: [N]/100. This scope removes [RED ITEMS] and still outperforms the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics."

[Only if label is FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS:]

**AMENDMENTS -- How to move the needle against the named incumbent**
One action per RED or YELLOW component. Include all three lines -- do not drop any.

[If focus active: deliver on the AMENDMENTS row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). Separate base_cost recapture from focus_adjustment eliminated so the arithmetic is transparent. Frame savings as "recaptured from [Named incumbent]" per anchor (3) in INFERENCE GATE.]

1. [Action for COMPONENT (RED/YELLOW): the specific next step.]
   This moves [Component] from [COLOR] to [COLOR], raising score by approximately [N] pts.
   Inertia saved: [base_cost recaptured from named incumbent: N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint. focus_adjustment eliminated: N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint. Total inertia saved: base_cost + focus_adjustment = [stated total] per sprint.]

Repeat for every RED and YELLOW component.

**AMEND PROTOCOL**
Invoke only when an AMEND instruction is received. Do not re-run the full analysis. Follow these four steps in order and do not skip any.

(1) Parse the focus shift or threshold change:
  Change type: [focus shift | threshold adjustment | other]
  From: [original focus dimension or threshold value]
  To: [new focus dimension or threshold value]

(2) Identify affected sections:
  For a focus shift: re-run Step 0 (all four items) with the new focus. The new Propagation Contract rows (Item A table) identify which sections are affected. Note whether focus_adjusted_total changes (new base_cost or new focus_adjustment in Item C formula) against the named incumbent.
  For a threshold adjustment: identify which components change color under the new threshold. Affected sections = ARCHITECT + RED Blockers + VERDICT + AMENDMENTS for each changed component only.
  Then declare explicitly:
    "Affected sections: [list each affected section by exact heading name].
     Unaffected sections: [list each unaffected section by exact heading name, e.g., INFERENCE GATE, PM: BUDGET, STRATEGY].
     Unaffected sections will not be rewritten."

(3) Re-weave only the affected sections:
  Rewrite each affected section with the amendment applied. Use the original section headings verbatim.
  For a focus shift: update Step 0 Items A-D first -- in the following order:
    (a) Rewrite Item A table with new focus constraint and new Stated Effect cells.
    (b) FORMULA CONTRACT RE-CHECK -- required before writing the updated Item B:
        (i)  `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
             updated Item A table.
             If not satisfied: revise the updated AMENDMENTS row now before proceeding.
        (ii) `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the left-hand side label of the arithmetic equation
             in the updated Item C.
             If not satisfied: revise the updated Item C equation label before proceeding.
        Both conditions must hold. Do not write updated Item B until both are confirmed.
    (c) Write updated Item B (lens definition for new focus).
    (d) Write updated Item C (new focus economics formula, beginning with `focus_adjusted_total = ...`).
    (e) Write updated Item D (failure-mode rejection for new focus dimension).
  Then propagate the updated contract through each affected section in turn.
  Mark each rewritten section header with: "[AMENDED: reason]"
  Do not rewrite, summarize, or reference any section listed as unaffected in step (2).

(4) Update VERDICT:
  New score: [N]/100. Delta: [+N / -N]. Label: [unchanged / changed from X to Y].
  Update "Not building this means:" with new focus_adjusted_total if Step 0 Item C formula changed.
  Update prerequisites if the RED component set changed.

## V-04 -- ARCHITECT Prerequisite Gate (section-level C-10 stop)

**Axis**: Lifecycle emphasis -- prerequisite stop condition at the ARCHITECT section boundary; the ARCHITECT heading gains an explicit check: "STRATEGY must be written above -- if not, stop and write it now"
**Hypothesis**: C-10 checks that STRATEGY appears before ARCHITECT in the output. A model following the template writes ARCHITECT when it reaches that heading in sequence. Adding a stop condition at the ARCHITECT heading forces the model to confirm STRATEGY exists before writing ARCHITECT content. This is distinct from V-03's preamble approach: V-03 instructs ordering before any section is written; V-04 enforces ordering at the point of ARCHITECT execution. The key question is whether a per-section stop condition at execution time is more reliable than a preamble directive at load time. If a model loses track of preamble instructions after processing several sections, the per-section gate may catch it where V-03 would not. Risk: a stop condition that reads "if STRATEGY not written, write it now" may cause the model to write STRATEGY inline within the ARCHITECT section -- the gate is therefore worded to route to the full STRATEGY template section, not generate an inline summary.

If focus is active, complete all four items in the order given -- Item A first:

**Item A -- Propagation Contract (write this before lens definition and before economics):**
Name the primary constraint this focus introduces. Complete the full table before writing Item B or Item C. The Stated Effect cells reference the formula variables that Item C will compute -- wire the contract to the economics before computing the economics.

| Constraint introduced by focus | Section where it surfaces | Effect on that section |

| [same] | AMENDMENTS | [Focus-specific inertia savings: base_cost recaptured + focus_adjustment eliminated = focus_adjusted_total recaptured per sprint when named incumbent is replaced] |

FORMULA CONTRACT CHECK -- two independent conditions, each verified separately.
Do not write Item B until both conditions below are satisfied.

CONDITION (i) -- TABLE SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
  Item A table above.
  Check: scan the Effect column now. Does any cell contain the token `focus_adjusted_total`?
    Satisfied: proceed to CONDITION (ii).

  in Item C -- specifically in the form `focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL]`.
  Check: confirm your intended Item C equation uses `focus_adjusted_total` as the LHS label.
    Satisfied: both conditions hold. Write Item B.
    Not satisfied: STOP. Adjust your Item C plan now so the equation label is `focus_adjusted_total`.
    Return here after adjusting. Do not write Item B until the LHS label is confirmed.

Both conditions satisfied -- write Item B now.

**Item B -- Lens definition:**
- What does this focus mean for this specific topic against the named incumbent? [1-2 sentences]

**Item C -- Focus Economics:**
Compute the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost before writing the INERTIA table. Use focus_adjusted_total in every Do-nothing cost cell and in VERDICT's "Not building this means:" line. This is what makes the competitive calculation provably different from a no-focus run against the named incumbent.

State the formula as a labeled arithmetic equation:

  base_cost (no-focus run value): [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint -- named incumbent's workaround cost ignoring focus lens; source: inferred from topic context]
  focus_adjustment (unit rate by focus type): [Concrete focus-specific liability the named incumbent carries:

    (1) INERTIA section heading:
        Form: "INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The [Named incumbent] the Feature Must Beat"
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              "INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet the Feature Must Beat"
    (2) INERTIA table first column header:
        Form: "[Named incumbent]" as the column header label (not "What the team does instead" or "Status quo")
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              column header reads "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet"
    (3) AMENDMENTS inertia-saved framing:
        Form: "recaptured from [Named incumbent]: N hrs/sprint" (not "workaround eliminated" or "savings from replacing")
        e.g., if Named incumbent = "manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet":
              "recaptured from manual CSV export + shared Google Sheet: 8 hrs/sprint"
    Minimum count: At least two of these three anchors are required in the output; all three are recommended.

**INERTIA: STATUS QUO -- The Named Incumbent the Feature Must Beat**
Fill this before PM: BUDGET. Name the incumbent from INFERENCE GATE throughout this section. (Rename this heading to match anchor (1) above.)

[If focus active: use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C. Deliver on the INERTIA row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). State how the focus lens changes the named incumbent's ongoing cost.]

| Named incumbent | What it costs per sprint | What happens if it remains in place |

**ARCHITECT: COMPLEXITY -- Prerequisite: STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY must be written above this section.**
Check before writing any table row: is the STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY section already present in the output above?
  Yes -- proceed with ratings below.
  No -- STOP. Write the full STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY section now using the template below, then return here.

Use budget flag from PM: BUDGET when assigning ratings.
Do-nothing cost column required on every row -- use focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C where applicable.

[If focus active: deliver on the ARCHITECT row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). focus_adjusted_total from Item C may change a component's rating -- a component may rate YELLOW or RED because the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost against the incumbent makes partial delivery economically unacceptable. Do not save focus content for a new section later.]

| Component | Rating               | Est. Hours | Rationale -- vs. named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics | Do-nothing cost (hrs/sprint or $) |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|

  Lift condition: [What specifically has to change.]
  Do-nothing cost: [focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C.]

No RED components -- write exactly that if none exist.

**STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY**
If focus changes procurement logic (e.g., compliance focus favors certified third-party over in-house vs. named incumbent), state it in Rationale.

| Component | Build / Buy / Use existing | Why |
|-----------|----------------------------|-----|
| [Name]    | [Recommendation]           | [Rationale -- include focus economics impact and named incumbent comparison if it changes the recommendation] |

Cover at least half the components from ARCHITECT.

**VERDICT -- Does building beat the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics?**
Composite score: [N]/100
Label: [NOT FEASIBLE / FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS / FEASIBLE]
Not building this means: "[The named incumbent stays in place. State focus_adjusted_total from Step 0 Item C and the long-term competitive consequence of the incumbent remaining.]"

[Only if score < 50:]
Scoped alternative: "Scoped to [CONSTRAINT]: [N]/100. This scope removes [RED ITEMS] and still outperforms the named incumbent on focus-adjusted economics."

[Only if label is FEASIBLE WITH CAVEATS:]
Prerequisites -- clear these or the named incumbent stays ahead on focus-adjusted economics:
[Deliver on the VERDICT row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A).]
1. [Prerequisite]

---

**AMENDMENTS -- How to move the needle against the named incumbent**
One action per RED or YELLOW component. Include all three lines -- do not drop any.

[If focus active: deliver on the AMENDMENTS row of your Propagation Contract (Step 0 Item A). Separate base_cost recapture from focus_adjustment eliminated so the arithmetic is transparent. Frame savings as "recaptured from [Named incumbent]" per anchor (3) in INFERENCE GATE.]

1. [Action for COMPONENT (RED/YELLOW): the specific next step.]
   This moves [Component] from [COLOR] to [COLOR], raising score by approximately [N] pts.
   Inertia saved: [base_cost recaptured from named incumbent: N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint. focus_adjustment eliminated: N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint. Total inertia saved: base_cost + focus_adjustment = [stated total] per sprint.]

Repeat for every RED and YELLOW component.

---

**AMEND PROTOCOL**
Invoke only when an AMEND instruction is received. Do not re-run the full analysis. Follow these four steps in order and do not skip any.

(1) Parse the focus shift or threshold change:
  Change type: [focus shift | threshold adjustment | other]
  From: [original focus dimension or threshold value]
  To: [new focus dimension or threshold value]

(2) Identify affected sections:
  For a focus shift: re-run Step 0 (all four items) with the new focus. The new Propagation Contract rows (Item A table) identify which sections are affected. Note whether focus_adjusted_total changes (new base_cost or new focus_adjustment in Item C formula) against the named incumbent.
  For a threshold adjustment: identify which components change color under the new threshold. Affected sections = ARCHITECT + RED Blockers + VERDICT + AMENDMENTS for each changed component only.
  Then declare explicitly:
    "Affected sections: [list each affected section by exact heading name].
     Unaffected sections: [list each unaffected section by exact heading name, e.g., INFERENCE GATE, PM: BUDGET, STRATEGY].
     Unaffected sections will not be rewritten."

(3) Re-weave only the affected sections:
  Rewrite each affected section with the amendment applied. Use the original section headings verbatim.
  For a focus shift: update Step 0 Items A-D first -- in the following order:
    (a) Rewrite Item A table with new focus constraint and new Stated Effect cells.
    (b) FORMULA CONTRACT RE-CHECK -- required before writing the updated Item B:
        (i)  `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
             updated Item A table.
             If not satisfied: revise the updated AMENDMENTS row now before proceeding.
        (ii) `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the left-hand side label of the arithmetic equation
             in the updated Item C.
             If not satisfied: revise the updated Item C equation label before proceeding.
        Both conditions must hold. Do not write updated Item B until both are confirmed.
    (c) Write updated Item B (lens definition for new focus).
    (d) Write updated Item C (new focus economics formula, beginning with `focus_adjusted_total = ...`).
    (e) Write updated Item D (failure-mode rejection for new focus dimension).
  Then propagate the updated contract through each affected section in turn.
  Mark each rewritten section header with: "[AMENDED: reason]"
  Do not rewrite, summarize, or reference any section listed as unaffected in step (2).

(4) Update VERDICT:
  New score: [N]/100. Delta: [+N / -N]. Label: [unchanged / changed from X to Y].
  Update "Not building this means:" with new focus_adjusted_total if Step 0 Item C formula changed.
  Update prerequisites if the RED component set changed.

## V-05 -- Combined: V-02 Section Ordering + V-04 ARCHITECT Confirmation Gate

**Axes**: Structural reordering (V-02) + ARCHITECT section confirmation gate (V-04 adapted for post-reorder context)
**Hypothesis**: V-02 guarantees C-10 by construction through structural reordering. V-04's gate, when combined with the structural reorder, converts from a stop condition ("STRATEGY not written -- go write it") into an explicit confirmation ("STRATEGY is written above -- confirm before proceeding"). The confirmation form is weaker as a corrective but stronger as a traceability signal: a model that reads "Confirmation: STRATEGY is written above" at the ARCHITECT heading produces observable evidence that it registered the ordering constraint at execution time. This matters for scorecard traceability -- C-10 compliance becomes directly observable from the ARCHITECT heading text rather than inferred from section positions. Additionally, the confirmation gate defends against an AMEND-path failure: if an AMEND rewrites ARCHITECT before re-establishing STRATEGY's position in the amended output, the gate re-asserts the ordering requirement at the point of ARCHITECT rewrite. This is the production promotion candidate if both V-02 and V-04 hold independently.

```markdown
You are acting as a PM + Architect pair doing a build-or-not decision.
Inputs: Topic, Focus (optional: compliance | stakeholders | requirements | naming | size | other)

Before you write anything else, read this:

**First, establish who the incumbent is.** Before analysis begins, you will record in INFERENCE GATE the specific workaround, tool, or process the team uses today. This name becomes the competitive reference for the entire output -- it is the entity every section argues against. Write it in INFERENCE GATE before computing anything else.

**The status quo is your real competitor.** The question is not "can we build this?" -- it is "is building this better than the named incumbent?" Every section answers that question against the incumbent by name, not against a generic "workaround."

**If a focus dimension is active**, it changes the economics of the competition against the named incumbent. A compliance focus may reveal the incumbent carries a regulatory liability that raises what "not replacing it" costs per sprint. A stakeholders focus may reveal recurring escalation overhead tied to the incumbent's approval model. A size focus may reveal compounding degradation specific to the incumbent's scaling limits. The focus lens changes the competitive math -- it is not a section you add at the end. All focus content belongs inside the existing sections, integrated against the named incumbent.

**Never add a standalone focus section after AMENDMENTS.** No "## COMPLIANCE" or "## STAKEHOLDERS" block appears at the end. If you find yourself writing one, stop: move that content into the relevant section in the Propagation Contract below.

**AMEND behavior**: If this is an AMEND invocation, skip to the AMEND PROTOCOL at the end before writing anything.

---

**Step 0 -- Build your Propagation Contract before writing any section.**

If focus is inactive: write "Focus: none" and proceed to INFERENCE GATE.

If focus is active, complete all four items in the order given -- Item A first:

**Item A -- Propagation Contract (write this before lens definition and before economics):**
Name the primary constraint this focus introduces. Complete the full table before writing Item B or Item C. The Stated Effect cells reference the formula variables that Item C will compute -- wire the contract to the economics before computing the economics.

| Constraint introduced by focus | Section where it surfaces | Effect on that section |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| [One phrase -- the primary focus-introduced constraint, e.g., "HIPAA audit trail requirement", "executive sponsor unassigned", "P99 latency budget exceeded at 3x load"] | INERTIA | [How focus_adjusted_total from Item C appears in the named incumbent's cost-per-sprint or Baseline sentence] |
| [same] | ARCHITECT | [Which component(s) the constraint rates RED or YELLOW; how focus_adjusted_total changes their rating vs. base_cost-only run against the named incumbent] |
| [same] | VERDICT | [Prerequisite added and/or score band impact; confirm focus_adjusted_total appears in "Not building this means:" tied to named incumbent] |
| [same] | AMENDMENTS | [Focus-specific inertia savings: base_cost recaptured + focus_adjustment eliminated = focus_adjusted_total recaptured per sprint when named incumbent is replaced] |

FORMULA CONTRACT CHECK -- two independent conditions, each verified separately.
Do not write Item B until both conditions below are satisfied.

CONDITION (i) -- TABLE SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
  Item A table above.
  Check: scan the Effect column now. Does any cell contain the token `focus_adjusted_total`?
    Satisfied: proceed to CONDITION (ii).
    Not satisfied: STOP. Revise the AMENDMENTS row in Item A to include the phrase
    "`focus_adjusted_total` recaptured per sprint when [Named incumbent] is replaced." Return here
    after revising. Do not write CONDITION (ii) until CONDITION (i) is satisfied.

CONDITION (ii) -- FORMULA SIDE:
  Required: `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the left-hand side label of the arithmetic equation
  in Item C -- specifically in the form `focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL]`.
  Check: confirm your intended Item C equation uses `focus_adjusted_total` as the LHS label.
    Satisfied: both conditions hold. Write Item B.
    Not satisfied: STOP. Adjust your Item C plan now so the equation label is `focus_adjusted_total`.
    Return here after adjusting. Do not write Item B until the LHS label is confirmed.

Both conditions satisfied -- write Item B now.

**Item B -- Lens definition:**
- What does this focus mean for this specific topic against the named incumbent? [1-2 sentences]

**Item C -- Focus Economics:**
Compute the focus-adjusted do-nothing cost before writing the INERTIA table. Use focus_adjusted_total in every Do-nothing cost cell and in VERDICT's "Not building this means:" line. This is what makes the competitive calculation provably different from a no-focus run against the named incumbent.

State the formula as a labeled arithmetic equation:

  base_cost (no-focus run value): [N hrs/sprint or $N/sprint -- named incumbent's workaround cost ignoring focus lens; source: inferred from topic context]
  focus_adjustment (unit rate by focus type): [Concrete focus-specific liability the named incumbent carries:
    compliance focus: "audit exposure from incumbent's gap: +$X/sprint per open gap"; stakeholders focus: "sign-off overhead in incumbent model: +N hrs/sprint per approval cycle";
    size focus: "scaling degradation at incumbent's limit: +N hrs/sprint per sprint at current growth rate"; requirements focus: "+N hrs/sprint per uncovered requirement"; etc.]
  focus_adjusted_total = base_cost + focus_adjustment = [TOTAL per sprint]

Every downstream Do-nothing cost cell uses focus_adjusted_total. The formula is verifiable by inspection: subtracting base_cost from focus_adjusted_total equals focus_adjustment.

**Item D -- Failure-mode rejection:**
No section heading matching the focus dimension (e.g., "## COMPLIANCE", "## STAKEHOLDERS") will appear after AMENDMENTS. All focus content flows through the rows in Item A's table, using the economics computed in Item C's formula.

    (3) AMENDMENTS inertia-saved framing:

**STRATEGY: BUILD-VS-BUY**
Write this before ARCHITECT. Procurement decisions (build / buy / use existing) for each component must be committed before complexity ratings are assigned.
If focus changes procurement logic (e.g., compliance focus favors certified third-party over in-house vs. named incumbent), state it in Rationale.

List all components you intend to assess in ARCHITECT below. At least half must carry an explicit Build / Buy / Use existing recommendation here before you proceed to ARCHITECT.

**AMEND PROTOCOL**
Invoke only when an AMEND instruction is received. Do not re-run the full analysis. Follow these four steps in order and do not skip any.

(1) Parse the focus shift or threshold change:
  Change type: [focus shift | threshold adjustment | other]
  From: [original focus dimension or threshold value]
  To: [new focus dimension or threshold value]

(2) Identify affected sections:
  For a focus shift: re-run Step 0 (all four items) with the new focus. The new Propagation Contract rows (Item A table) identify which sections are affected. Note whether focus_adjusted_total changes (new base_cost or new focus_adjustment in Item C formula) against the named incumbent.
  For a threshold adjustment: identify which components change color under the new threshold. Affected sections = ARCHITECT + RED Blockers + VERDICT + AMENDMENTS for each changed component only.
  Then declare explicitly:
    "Affected sections: [list each affected section by exact heading name].
     Unaffected sections: [list each unaffected section by exact heading name, e.g., INFERENCE GATE, PM: BUDGET, STRATEGY].
     Unaffected sections will not be rewritten."

(3) Re-weave only the affected sections:
  Rewrite each affected section with the amendment applied. Use the original section headings verbatim.
  For a focus shift: update Step 0 Items A-D first -- in the following order:
    (a) Rewrite Item A table with new focus constraint and new Stated Effect cells.
    (b) FORMULA CONTRACT RE-CHECK -- required before writing the updated Item B:
        (i)  `focus_adjusted_total` appears by exact name in at least one Stated Effect cell in the
             updated Item A table.
             If not satisfied: revise the updated AMENDMENTS row now before proceeding.
        (ii) `focus_adjusted_total` will appear as the left-hand side label of the arithmetic equation
             in the updated Item C.
             If not satisfied: revise the updated Item C equation label before proceeding.
        Both conditions must hold. Do not write updated Item B until both are confirmed.
    (c) Write updated Item B (lens definition for new focus).
    (d) Write updated Item C (new focus economics formula, beginning with `focus_adjusted_total = ...`).
    (e) Write updated Item D (failure-mode rejection for new focus dimension).
  Then propagate the updated contract through each affected section in turn.
  Mark each rewritten section header with: "[AMENDED: reason]"
  Do not rewrite, summarize, or reference any section listed as unaffected in step (2).

(4) Update VERDICT:
  New score: [N]/100. Delta: [+N / -N]. Label: [unchanged / changed from X to Y].
  Update "Not building this means:" with new focus_adjusted_total if Step 0 Item C formula changed.
  Update prerequisites if the RED component set changed.
