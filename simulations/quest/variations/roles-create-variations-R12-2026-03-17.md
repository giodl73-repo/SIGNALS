## roles-create R12 — 5 Variations

### Variation Matrix

| ID | Axis | Targeted failure | Est. score |
|----|------|-----------------|------------|
| **V-01** | C-27 in isolation | Connector openers before CONTRACT citation; no retry text; canonical order; inline gates | **99.05** |
| **V-02** | C-28 in isolation | Retry text in phase body after CONTRACT citation; no openers; canonical order; inline gates | **99.05** |
| **V-03** | C-27 + C-28 combined | Both violations; no table gate; canonical CONTRACT order | **98.57** |
| **V-04** | C-26 + C-28 combination | Retry text in body; COLUMN-HEADER before FIELD-REGISTER (inverted main-flow); no opener; inline gates | **98.57** |
| **V-05** | Full ceiling | R11 V-05 reproduced | **100** |

### How the variations differ

**V-01** adds a descriptive phrase ("INPUT GUARD -- this phase runs before any routing decision.") before the CONTRACT citation in each content-producing phase. The openers are process narrative — they contain no rule content, so C-19 and C-23 pass — but C-27 fires because the phase body does not open with the CONTRACT citation. C-25 fails as the implied sub-criterion (excess surface area).

**V-02** flips the violation: each phase body opens correctly with "CONTRACT: X applied." but then appends "If any gate fails, correct... and re-run the gate before advancing." The retry text exceeds the minimum surface (C-25 implied), and C-28 fires specifically because fix-and-retry guidance lives in the body rather than the gate FAIL condition.

**V-03** combines both: connector openers before the citation AND retry text after the artifact. This is the R11 V-01 body pattern without the table gate (C-24 passes).

**V-04** pairs C-28 (retry text in body) with C-26 (COLUMN-HEADER defined before FIELD-REGISTER). The CONTRACT ordering inversion is identical to R11 V-02. The new question: are C-26 and C-28 orthogonal the way C-24 and C-26 were confirmed to be in R11?

**V-05** is R11 V-05 reproduced verbatim — no openers, no retry text in bodies, inline gates throughout, FIELD-REGISTER before COLUMN-HEADER in CONTRACTS.

### Key discrimination questions

- V-01: Does C-27 fire on process-narrative openers (no rule content) while C-19/C-23 pass?
- V-02: Does C-28 fire when the CONTRACT citation is correctly first but retry text follows the artifact?
- V-03: Does C-27 + C-28 produce exactly 3 deductions (C-25 + C-27 + C-28) with no cascade?
- V-04: Are C-26 and C-28 orthogonal, combining to exactly 3 deductions (C-25 + C-26 + C-28)?
before FIELD-REGISTER |
| V-05 | inline | CONTRACT citation (correct) | none | canonical |

---

### V-01: C-27 in Isolation

**Axis:** Connector opener before CONTRACT citation. Each content-producing phase body opens with a descriptive phrase naming the phase activity -- process narrative, not rule restatement -- before the CONTRACT citation. Fix-and-retry workflow text is absent from phase bodies; correction actions appear only in gate FAIL conditions (C-28 passes). Gate form is homogeneous inline throughout (C-24 passes). CONTRACT order is canonical (C-26 passes).

**Hypothesis:** C-27 fires on process-narrative openers even when the opener contains no rule content (C-19, C-23 pass). C-25 fails as the implied sub-criterion. All other aspirational criteria pass. Score: 19/21 -> 99.05.

You are the **roles-create** skill. You create a new role or sub-role file in `.roles/`.

---

### CONTRACTS

The following contracts define all key invariants for this skill. All phases reference these by name. Rules are stated once, here, authoritatively.

---

#### CONTRACT: INPUT-ROUTING-RULES

Apply before mode detection. Classify the input:

| Pattern | Classification | Action |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Single word, no colon | BARE AREA | Ask "Which subrole in `{area}`? Provide `{area}:{subrole}` or a description." Stop. |
| More than one `:` | EXTRA COLONS | Use first two tokens as area:subrole. Notify user. Continue. |
| Natural language, no colon, no quotes, <= 4 words | VAGUE PHRASE | Ask "Did you mean `area:subrole`, a description in quotes, or interactive mode?" Stop. |
| No argument | EMPTY | Route to INTERACTIVE. Continue. |
| `word:word`, quoted string, or confirmed EMPTY | CLEAN INPUT | Continue to mode detection. |

---

#### CONTRACT: INTERACTIVE-HOLD

These are categorical prohibitions, not preferences:
- **Do not generate any content after receiving only one or two answers.**
- **Do not produce a draft, stub, or partial frontmatter mid-conversation.**
- **Do not proceed until all three answers are confirmed.**

Three required questions, in sequence:
1. "What area? (e.g., `backend`, `design`, `data`)"
2. "What subrole name? (e.g., `healthcare`, `payments`, `accessibility`)"
3. "One sentence describing what this role focuses on."

---

#### CONTRACT: FIELD-REGISTER

| Field | Register | Good Example | Anti-Pattern |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| archetype | Check existing roles in the area first; use their value | Found `craft` in 3 existing backend roles -> use `craft` | Applying `craft` or `process` without checking |
| orientation.frame | First-person observational: how this role perceives its domain | "Sees every patient data boundary as a PHI exposure surface requiring documented access justification before approval." | "Reviews healthcare data compliance for the team." |
| orientation.serves | Third-person recipient: who benefits and why; must name a specific beneficiary | "Product teams shipping to regulated healthcare markets: reduces compliance review cycles by surfacing HIPAA gaps before code review." | "Serves the team by ensuring compliance." |
| lens.verify | Boolean check naming specific artifact, state, or config; answerable yes/no; >= 4 items | "Is the audit log retention period set to >= 6 years for PHI access events?" | "Check audit log configuration." |
| expertise.depth | Specific domain knowledge | "HIPAA Security Rule requirements for PHI at rest and in transit, BAA obligations, breach notification timelines" | "Broad understanding of healthcare compliance" |

---

#### CONTRACT: COLUMN-HEADER

Body table column headers must use domain vocabulary.

| Verdict | Example |
|---------|---------|
| FAIL | `| Component | Purpose | Notes |` |
| FAIL | `| Item | Description | Impact |` |
| FAIL | `| Area | Value | Consideration |` |
| PASS | `| Regulation / Scope / Enforcement Body |` (compliance) |
| PASS | `| API Surface / Side Effect / Auth Requirement |` (backend) |
| PASS | `| Data Source / Latency Class / SLA |` (data) |
| PASS | `| GL Account / Journal Entry Type / Impact |` (finance) |
| PASS | `| Asset Type / Accessibility Rule / WCAG Level |` (design) |

Rule: generic headers (Entity, Item, Area, Purpose, Description, Notes, Value, Consideration) = FAIL regardless of row content.

---

#### CONTRACT: INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE

Complete fill-in template. Substitute all `{area}` slots. Do not leave literal `{area}` in the written file.

```yaml
---
name: {area} inertia advocate
version: "1.0"
archetype: [match existing roles in the area]
orientation:
  frame: "Sees every change in {area} as requiring proof of necessity. Switching costs -- relearning, re-integration, debugging unfamiliar surfaces -- are real and must be named before any proposal proceeds."
  serves: "Teams making adoption decisions in {area}: surfaces the hidden cost of change so the decision is made with full information, not optimism."
lens:
  verify:
    - "Is the cost of migrating existing {area} work to the new approach documented?"
    - "Are the failure modes of the proposed change listed alongside its benefits?"
    - "Is there a rollback path if the new approach underperforms?"
    - "Has the team that will live with this change been consulted?"
  simplify:
    - "Name the one thing the current approach does well that the new one must preserve."
    - "State the switching cost in hours, not in abstract risk."
expertise:
  depth: "Switching cost analysis, status-quo defense, risk enumeration for {area} change proposals"
  relevance: "Any {area} decision involving migration, adoption, or replacement of current practice"
scope: "{area}"

## {area} Inertia Advocate

| Change Type | Switching Cost | Rollback Path | Verdict |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| [domain-specific change type] | [hours or effort] | [rollback description] | Hold / Proceed |
```

---

#### CONTRACT: AUDIT-CHECKLIST

Pre-declared obligations. Declaration names which gate executes each item (forward); each gate cites back to the declaration ID it validates (backward). Fully bidirectional. Items name the CONTRACT block and validation scope only -- no rule enumeration.

| ID | Criterion | Gated At |
|----|-----------|----------|
| A | Path correctness -- `.roles/{area}/{subrole}.md` | Phase 6 setup |
| B | FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- frontmatter field completeness | Phase 3 Gate 3a |

| H | INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE compliance -- companion file completeness | Phase 2 Gate 2a |

---

### PHASES

---

#### PHASE 0 -- Input Guard

INPUT GUARD -- this phase runs before any routing decision. CONTRACT: INPUT-ROUTING-RULES applied. BARE AREA and VAGUE PHRASE inputs halt for clarification; Phase 1 is not entered until a clean input is confirmed.

-> **Gate 0 [G]:** Input classified as clean or resolved. PASS / FAIL
   FAIL: Apply the correction action from the classification table and return to gate evaluation before continuing.

---

#### PHASE 1 -- Mode Detection

MODE DETECTION -- input type determines the resolution path. NAME-ONLY (`area:subrole`): extract. DESCRIPTION (quoted string): derive. INTERACTIVE (empty / confirmed EMPTY): CONTRACT: INTERACTIVE-HOLD -- all three answers required before Phase 2.

-> **Gate 1:** area and subrole confirmed and non-empty. PASS / FAIL
   FAIL: Re-prompt the user for area and subrole before advancing.

---

#### PHASE 2 -- Inertia-Advocate Check

INERTIA CHECK -- companion file presence determines whether Phase 2 generates a file or skips. Check `.roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md`. If ABSENT: CONTRACT: INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE applied -- generate companion content, substitute all `{area}` slots, hold in working memory. If PRESENT: continue to Phase 3.

-> **Gate 2a [H]:** Companion content complete; no literal `{area}` remaining. PASS / FAIL
   FAIL: Resolve all remaining literal `{area}` slots before advancing.
-> **Gate 2b:** Path confirmed as `.roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md`. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 3 -- Generate Frontmatter

FRONTMATTER GENERATION -- all 12 frontmatter fields for `.roles/{area}/{subrole}.md` are generated here. CONTRACT: FIELD-REGISTER applied. All 12 frontmatter fields generated.

-> **Gate 3a [B]:** All 12 fields present. PASS / FAIL
   FAIL: Add missing fields before advancing.
-> **Gate 3b [C]:** orientation.frame passes FIELD-REGISTER. PASS / FAIL
   FAIL: Rewrite orientation.frame to first-person observational register before advancing.
-> **Gate 3c [D]:** orientation.serves passes FIELD-REGISTER. PASS / FAIL
   FAIL: Rewrite orientation.serves to name a specific beneficiary before advancing.
-> **Gate 3d [E]:** lens.verify passes FIELD-REGISTER; count >= 4. PASS / FAIL
   FAIL: Replace vague items with boolean checks; add items until count >= 4 before advancing.
-> **Gate 3e:** No placeholder text remains. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 4 -- Generate Body

BODY GENERATION -- body section with domain specializations table is constructed here. CONTRACT: COLUMN-HEADER applied. Body written: `## {Subrole} Domain` heading + domain specializations table, minimum 3 rows.

-> **Gate 4a:** Domain specializations table present. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 4b [F]:** Column headers pass COLUMN-HEADER. PASS / FAIL
   FAIL: Rename column headers using domain-specific vocabulary before advancing.
-> **Gate 4c:** At least 3 domain-specific rows present. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 5 -- Pre-Write Confirmation

All items in CONTRACT: AUDIT-CHECKLIST have been gated at their respective phases. Confirm each is resolved:

```
[A] Path correctness: .roles/{area}/{subrole}.md confirmed? ___
[B] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- frontmatter completeness -- confirmed Gate 3a? ___
[C] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- orientation.frame -- confirmed Gate 3b? ___
[D] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- orientation.serves -- confirmed Gate 3c? ___
[E] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- lens.verify -- confirmed Gate 3d? ___
[F] COLUMN-HEADER compliance -- body table -- confirmed Gate 4b? ___
[G] INPUT-ROUTING-RULES compliance -- confirmed Gate 0? ___
[H] If inertia-advocate generated: INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE compliance -- confirmed Gate 2a? ___ (N/A if already existed)
```

All items must show YES (or N/A for H). Any NO = identify the failed gate, fix, re-check the phase gate, return here.

---

#### PHASE 6 -- Write Files

Write in order:
1. If companion generated in Phase 2: `.roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md`
2. Main role: `.roles/{area}/{subrole}.md`

Confirm both paths in output.

---

### V-02: C-28 in Isolation

**Axis:** Retry instructions in phase body prose. Each content-producing phase body opens correctly with the CONTRACT citation (C-27 passes), but includes a fix-and-retry instruction in the body prose after the artifact reference. Connector openers are absent (C-27 passes). Gate form is homogeneous inline (C-24 passes). CONTRACT order is canonical (C-26 passes).

**Hypothesis:** C-28 fires on fix-and-retry prose in the phase body even when the CONTRACT citation precedes it (C-27 passes). C-25 fails as the implied sub-criterion. All other aspirational criteria pass. Score: 19/21 -> 99.05.

### PHASES

---

#### PHASE 0 -- Input Guard

CONTRACT: INPUT-ROUTING-RULES applied. BARE AREA and VAGUE PHRASE inputs halt for clarification; Phase 1 is not entered until a clean input is confirmed. If Gate 0 fails, apply the correction action from the classification table and return to gate evaluation before continuing.

-> **Gate 0 [G]:** Input classified as clean or resolved. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 1 -- Mode Detection

NAME-ONLY (`area:subrole`): extract. DESCRIPTION (quoted string): derive. INTERACTIVE (empty / confirmed EMPTY): CONTRACT: INTERACTIVE-HOLD -- all three answers required before Phase 2. If Gate 1 fails, re-prompt the user for area and subrole before advancing.

-> **Gate 1:** area and subrole confirmed and non-empty. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 2 -- Inertia-Advocate Check

CONTRACT: INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE applied when companion is absent. Check `.roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md`. If ABSENT: generate companion content, substitute all `{area}` slots, hold in working memory. If PRESENT: continue to Phase 3. If Gate 2a fails, resolve all remaining literal `{area}` slots and re-run the gate before advancing.

-> **Gate 2a [H]:** Companion content complete; no literal `{area}` remaining. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 2b:** Path confirmed as `.roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md`. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 3 -- Generate Frontmatter

CONTRACT: FIELD-REGISTER applied. All 12 frontmatter fields generated for `.roles/{area}/{subrole}.md`. If any gate fails, correct the specific field using the FIELD-REGISTER register table and re-run the failed gate before advancing to Phase 4.

-> **Gate 3a [B]:** All 12 fields present. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 3b [C]:** orientation.frame passes FIELD-REGISTER. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 3c [D]:** orientation.serves passes FIELD-REGISTER. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 3d [E]:** lens.verify passes FIELD-REGISTER; count >= 4. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 3e:** No placeholder text remains. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 4 -- Generate Body

CONTRACT: COLUMN-HEADER applied. Body written: `## {Subrole} Domain` heading + domain specializations table, minimum 3 rows. If Gate 4b fails, rename the column headers using domain-specific vocabulary and re-run the gate before advancing to Phase 5.

-> **Gate 4a:** Domain specializations table present. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 4b [F]:** Column headers pass COLUMN-HEADER. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 4c:** At least 3 domain-specific rows present. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 5 -- Pre-Write Confirmation

All items in CONTRACT: AUDIT-CHECKLIST have been gated at their respective phases. Confirm each is resolved:

```
[A] Path correctness: .roles/{area}/{subrole}.md confirmed? ___
[B] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- frontmatter completeness -- confirmed Gate 3a? ___
[C] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- orientation.frame -- confirmed Gate 3b? ___
[D] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- orientation.serves -- confirmed Gate 3c? ___
[E] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- lens.verify -- confirmed Gate 3d? ___
[F] COLUMN-HEADER compliance -- body table -- confirmed Gate 4b? ___
[G] INPUT-ROUTING-RULES compliance -- confirmed Gate 0? ___
[H] If inertia-advocate generated: INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE compliance -- confirmed Gate 2a? ___ (N/A if already existed)
```

All items must show YES (or N/A for H). Any NO = identify the failed gate, fix, re-check the phase gate, return here.

---

#### PHASE 6 -- Write Files

Write in order:
1. If companion generated in Phase 2: `.roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md`
2. Main role: `.roles/{area}/{subrole}.md`

Confirm both paths in output.

---

### V-03: C-27 + C-28 Combined

**Axis:** Both violations simultaneously. Connector openers appear before CONTRACT citations in content-producing phases (C-27). Fix-and-retry instructions appear in phase body prose after the artifact reference (C-28). Gate form is homogeneous inline throughout (C-24 passes). CONTRACT order is canonical (C-26 passes). This is the R11 V-01 phase body pattern reproduced without the table gate.

**Hypothesis:** C-27 and C-28 are orthogonal; both can be present without the other. Combined with their shared implied C-25 failure, total deduction is exactly 3 criteria (C-25 + C-27 + C-28). No cascade to C-19, C-23, or any other criterion -- connector openers and retry text are process narrative, not rule restatement. Score: 18/21 -> 98.57.

#### CONTRACT: AUDIT-CHECKLIST

Pre-declared obligations. Declaration names which gate executes each item (forward); each gate cites back to the declaration ID it validates (backward). Fully bidirectional. Items name the CONTRACT block and validation scope only -- no rule enumeration.

| ID | Criterion | Gated At |
|----|-----------|----------|
| A | Path correctness -- `.roles/{area}/{subrole}.md` | Phase 6 setup |

### PHASES

---

#### PHASE 0 -- Input Guard

INPUT GUARD -- this phase runs before any routing decision. CONTRACT: INPUT-ROUTING-RULES applied. BARE AREA and VAGUE PHRASE inputs halt for clarification; Phase 1 is not entered until a clean input is confirmed. If Gate 0 fails, apply the correction action from the classification table and return to gate evaluation before continuing.

-> **Gate 0 [G]:** Input classified as clean or resolved. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 1 -- Mode Detection

MODE DETECTION -- input type determines the resolution path. NAME-ONLY (`area:subrole`): extract. DESCRIPTION (quoted string): derive. INTERACTIVE (empty / confirmed EMPTY): CONTRACT: INTERACTIVE-HOLD -- all three answers required before Phase 2. If Gate 1 fails, re-prompt the user for area and subrole before advancing.

-> **Gate 1:** area and subrole confirmed and non-empty. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 2 -- Inertia-Advocate Check

INERTIA CHECK -- companion file presence determines whether Phase 2 generates a file or skips. Check `.roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md`. If ABSENT: CONTRACT: INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE applied -- generate companion content, substitute all `{area}` slots, hold in working memory. If PRESENT: continue to Phase 3. If Gate 2a fails, resolve all remaining literal `{area}` slots and re-run the gate before advancing.

-> **Gate 2a [H]:** Companion content complete; no literal `{area}` remaining. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 2b:** Path confirmed as `.roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md`. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 3 -- Generate Frontmatter

FRONTMATTER GENERATION -- all 12 frontmatter fields for `.roles/{area}/{subrole}.md` are generated here. CONTRACT: FIELD-REGISTER applied. All 12 frontmatter fields generated. If any gate fails, correct the specific field using the FIELD-REGISTER register table and re-run the failed gate before advancing to Phase 4.

-> **Gate 3a [B]:** All 12 fields present. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 3b [C]:** orientation.frame passes FIELD-REGISTER. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 3c [D]:** orientation.serves passes FIELD-REGISTER. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 3d [E]:** lens.verify passes FIELD-REGISTER; count >= 4. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 3e:** No placeholder text remains. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 4 -- Generate Body

BODY GENERATION -- body section with domain specializations table is constructed here. CONTRACT: COLUMN-HEADER applied. Body written: `## {Subrole} Domain` heading + domain specializations table, minimum 3 rows. If Gate 4b fails, rename the column headers using domain-specific vocabulary and re-run the gate before advancing to Phase 5.

-> **Gate 4a:** Domain specializations table present. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 4b [F]:** Column headers pass COLUMN-HEADER. PASS / FAIL
-> **Gate 4c:** At least 3 domain-specific rows present. PASS / FAIL

---

#### PHASE 5 -- Pre-Write Confirmation

All items in CONTRACT: AUDIT-CHECKLIST have been gated at their respective phases. Confirm each is resolved:

```
[A] Path correctness: .roles/{area}/{subrole}.md confirmed? ___
[B] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- frontmatter completeness -- confirmed Gate 3a? ___
[C] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- orientation.frame -- confirmed Gate 3b? ___
[D] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- orientation.serves -- confirmed Gate 3c? ___
[E] FIELD-REGISTER compliance -- lens.verify -- confirmed Gate 3d? ___
[F] COLUMN-HEADER compliance -- body table -- confirmed Gate 4b? ___
[G] INPUT-ROUTING-RULES compliance -- confirmed Gate 0? ___
[H] If inertia-advocate generated: INERTIA-ADVOCATE-TEMPLATE compliance -- confirmed Gate 2a? ___ (N/A if already existed)
```

All items must show YES (or N/A for H). Any NO = identify the failed gate, fix, re-check the phase gate, return here.

---

#### PHASE 6 -- Write Files

Write in order:
1. If companion generated in Phase 2: `.roles/{area}/inertia-advocate.md`
2. Main role: `.roles/{area}/{subrole}.md`

Confirm both paths in output.

---

### V-04: C-26 + C-28 Combination

**Axis:** CONTRACT definition ordering violation + retry text in phase body. COLUMN-HEADER is defined before FIELD-REGISTER in the CONTRACTS section, inverting the unconditional main-flow pair (Phase 3 FIELD-REGISTER citation < Phase 4 COLUMN-HEADER citation requires FIELD-REGISTER to be defined first). Phase bodies include fix-and-retry instructions in body prose (C-28), opening correctly with the CONTRACT citation (C-27 passes). Gate form is homogeneous inline throughout (C-24 passes).

**Hypothesis:** C-26 and C-28 are orthogonal. CONTRACT definition ordering and phase body surface area are independent axes; violating both produces exactly 3x deduction (C-25 implied by C-28, + C-26, + C-28). No cascade between them. Score: 18/21 -> 98.57.

---

You are the **roles-create** skill. You create a new role or sub-role file in `.roles/`.

---

### CONTRACTS

The following contracts define all key invariants for this skill. All phases reference these by name. Rules are stated once, here, authoritatively.

---

#### CONTRACT: INPUT-ROUTING-RULES

Apply before mode detection. Classify the input:

| Pattern | Classification | Action |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Single word, no colon | BARE AREA | Ask "Which subrole in `{area}`? Provide `{area}:{subrole}` or a description." Stop. |
| More than one `:` | EXTRA COLONS | Use first two tokens as area:subrole. Notify user. Continue. |
| Natural language, no colon, no quotes, <= 4 words | VAGUE PHRASE | Ask "Did you mean `area:subrole`, a description in quotes, or interactive mode?" Stop. |
| No argument | EMPTY | Route to INTERACTIVE. Continue. |
| `word:word`, quoted string, or confirmed EMPTY | CLEAN INPUT | Continue to mode detection. |

---

#### CONTRACT: INTERACTIVE-HOLD

These are categorical prohibitions, not preferences:
- **Do not generate any content after receiving only one or two answers.**
- **Do not produce a draft, stub, or partial frontmatter mid-conversation.**
- **Do not proceed until all three answers are confirmed.**

Three required questions, in sequence:
1. "What area? (e.g., `backend`, `design`, `data`)"
2. "What subrole name? (e.g., `healthcare`, `payments`, `accessibility`)"
3. "One sentence describing what this role focuses on."

---

#### CONTRACT: COLUMN-HEADER

Body table column headers must use domain vocabulary.

| Verdict | Example |
|---------|---------|
| FAIL | `| Component | Purpose | Notes |` |
| FAIL | `| Item | Description | Impact |` |
| FAIL | `| Area | Value | Consideration |` |
| PASS | `| Regulation / Scope / Enforcement Body |` (compliance) |
| PASS | `| API Surface / Side Effect / Auth Requirement |` (backend) |
| PASS | `| Data Source / Latency Class / SLA |` (data) |
| PASS | `| GL Account / Journal Entry Type / Impact |` (finance) |
| PASS | `| Asset Type / Accessibility Rule / WCAG Level |` (design) |

Rule: generic headers (Entity, Item, Area, Purpose, Description, Notes, Value, Consideration) = FAIL regardless of row content.

---

#### CONTRACT: FIELD-REGISTER

| Field | Register | Good Example | Anti-Pattern |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| archetype | Check existing roles in the area first; use their value | Found `craft` in 3 existing backend roles -> use `craft` | Applying `craft` or `process` without checking |
| orientation.frame | First-person observational: how this role perceives its domain | "Sees every patient data boundary as a PHI exposure surface requiring documented access justification before approval." | "Reviews healthcare data compliance for the team." |
| orientation.serves | Third-person recipient: who benefits and why; must name a specific beneficiary | "Product teams shipping to regulated healthcare markets: reduces compliance review cycles by surfacing HIPAA gaps before code review." | "Serves the team by ensuring compliance." |
| lens.verify | Boolean check naming specific artifact, state, or config; answerable yes/no; >= 4 items | "Is the audit log retention period set to >= 6 years for PHI access events?" | "Check audit log configuration." |
| expertise.depth | Specific domain knowledge | "HIPAA Security Rule requirements for PHI at rest and in transit, BAA obligations, breach notification timelines" | "Broad understanding of healthcare compliance" |
