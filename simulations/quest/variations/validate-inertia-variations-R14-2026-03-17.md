## R14 Variations -- V-66 through V-70

Written to `simulations/quest/variations/validate-inertia-variations-R14-2026-03-17.md` (96 KB, 1880 lines).

| # | Label | Axis | Predicted |
|---|-------|------|-----------|
| **V-66** | Ceiling: full gate in block body | C-41 PASS | **410** |
| **V-67** | Gate in produced label only | C-41 PARTIAL | **400** |
| **V-68** | Axes in block body, impossibility in label | C-41 split -- axes present | **395 or 400** |
| **V-69** | Impossibility in block body, axes in label | C-41 split -- impossibility present | **395 or 400** |
| **V-70** | Redundant dual-site gate | C-41 redundancy test | **410** |

**Structural questions for R14:**

- **Q1 (V-66):** Does a full per-axis gate (all 3 axes + impossibility) in the block body earn C-41 PASS (10 pts)? Establishes the 410/410 ceiling.
- **Q2 (V-67):** Does gate-in-produced-label-only earn C-41 PARTIAL (5 pts) as the rubric's explicit PARTIAL condition states? V-65 earned C-40 PARTIAL for this shape; C-41 now adds a second independent 5-pt opportunity for the same displacement.
- **Q3 (V-68):** Does axes-in-body without impossibility earn C-41 PARTIAL or FAIL? Naming all 3 axes in the block body is the harder half of C-40; missing only the impossibility statement mirrors the V-63 genuine-attempt question.
- **Q4 (V-69):** Does impossibility-in-body without axis labels earn C-41 FAIL or PARTIAL? The explicit PARTIAL condition names "per-axis gate in label only" -- an impossibility-only block body is a third structural shape not covered by that condition.
- **Q5 (V-70):** Does redundant placement (full gate in body AND full restatement in label) earn C-41 PASS identical to V-66, confirming label content is irrelevant to the body-placement verdict?

**Key isolation:** V-68 and V-69 are structural mirrors that together answer which half of the C-40 gate -- axis enumeration vs. impossibility declaration -- carries more weight for C-41's read-time enforcement requirement.
both axis naming AND impossibility in the block body; naming all axes is the harder half -- whether genuine-attempt doctrine yields PARTIAL here mirrors the V-63 question for C-40.
- **Q4 (V-69):** Does impossibility-in-body without axis enumeration earn C-41 FAIL (0 pts) or PARTIAL? Block body has the enforcement mechanism but not the axis labels. The explicit C-41 PARTIAL condition names "per-axis gate present only in the produced architecture label" -- an impossibility-only block body is a different failure shape. FAIL is the likely ruling.
- **Q5 (V-70):** Does redundant gate placement (full gate in block body AND full restatement in produced label) earn C-41 PASS identical to V-66? Tests that label-side restatement does not affect the block-body placement verdict.

The key isolation: V-66 and V-70 are ceiling tests (expected 410/410). V-67 confirms the
explicit PARTIAL condition. V-68 and V-69 probe the two split configurations to establish
which half of the C-40 gate -- axis enumeration vs. impossibility statement -- is the more
critical read-time component for C-41.

---

### V-66: Ceiling -- Full Per-Axis Gate in Block Body (C-41 PASS)

**Axis:** AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block gate condition enumerates all three axes by
label and declares partial satisfaction a gate failure -- placed entirely in the block
instruction body (read-time enforcement). Produced label summarizes without restating the
full per-axis gate.
**Hypothesis:** C-40 PASS (10 pts) + C-41 PASS (10 pts). C-01 through C-39 = 390 pts.
Ceiling: 410/410.
**Change from V-64 (R13 ceiling):** Block gate condition expands from V-64's single-axis impossibility ("A block
omitting Axis 3 fails this gate") to full three-axis enumeration with comprehensive
impossibility statement in block body. Produced label updated to reference block gate without
full restatement. All phases, CCV, and AMEND identical to V-64.

## Citation Architecture

Read this section once, in full, before Phase 1 begins. This architecture declares every
named artifact, exact-copy requirement, and derivation direction constraint before any
production phase begins. The three structural axes governing citation chain integrity are
declared in the AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block below. Read the block before Phase 1.

**Named artifacts, required outputs, and verification:**

| # | Phase / Position | Artifact or output | Downstream consumer | Requirement |
|---|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Phase 1 | "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED" | Phase 4 methodology traces | Exact-copy: copy artifact name, not "Phase 1" |
| 2 | Phase 2 | "PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED" | Phase 5(2) structural persistence | Exact-copy: copy artifact name, not "Phase 2" |
| 3 | Phase 5(3) | "LEVER POINT: [label]" | CCV (5); AMEND(d) | Exact-copy: copy the exact label string verbatim. AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor FROM the L3 Evidence column of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit -- the audit is the derivation authority; do not construct from Phase 5(3) and retroactively confirm. |
| 4 | Phase 6 Part B | "TRAJECTORY VERDICT: [direction]" | Phase 7; CCV (6) | Exact-copy: copy the exact direction word |
| 5 | After Phase 7, before CCV | CITATION CHAIN COMPLETENESS AUDIT | Self-verifying | See AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block below (Axes 1--3); CHAIN COMPLETE gate before CCV |

---

**AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED**

This block declares three co-resident axes. A model reading this block before Phase 1 knows
all three architecture constraints before executing any phase. All three axes are required
content of this block. A block missing any axis is an incomplete architecture declaration.

**Axis 1 -- Duality framing:** This output has two structural artifacts serving distinct and
non-substitutable roles. The Citation Architecture preamble (rows 1--5 above) is declarative:
it specifies what will be produced and how it will be cited before any production phase begins.
The Citation Chain Completeness Audit is confirmatory: it verifies what was produced after all
production phases are complete. These roles are structurally distinct. The preamble cannot
confirm chain integrity because it precedes production. The audit cannot declare artifact names
and exact-copy requirements because those must be known before Phase 1. Neither artifact
substitutes for or subsumes the other's function.

**Axis 2 -- Audit format:** The Citation Chain Completeness Audit (row 5) must use the
following 5-column structure for all four links: Source artifact | Consumer site | Evidence
[write actual downstream cite text verbatim -- for L3, write the exact "Lever anchor:
[LEVER POINT label]" text that will appear in AMEND(d); for L1/L2/L4, write the phrase from
the consuming section that names the source artifact character-for-character; write the actual
text produced, not a description or summary; the Evidence cell must be populated with real
text, not a placeholder] | Link type [Reference-chain if Evidence reproduces source artifact
label verbatim; Description-chain if Evidence describes or paraphrases] | Verdict [PASS for
Reference-chain; CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE for Description-chain -- not "weaker" or
"incomplete"]. Close with "CHAIN COMPLETE: all four links are reference chains" or "CHAIN
BREAK: [list link IDs] -- return to Phase [X] before proceeding."

**Axis 3 -- Derivation direction:** AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor from the L3
Evidence column of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit. Phase 5(3) is a prohibited
derivation source for the lever anchor in AMEND(d). CCV is a prohibited derivation source
for the lever anchor in AMEND(d). The L3 Evidence cell is the one permitted source. AMEND(d)
does not construct the anchor independently and retroactively confirm; it copies from L3
Evidence directly. This derivation direction and these prohibitions are declared at the
architecture-read boundary so that the full constraint -- required source AND forbidden
sources -- is known before any production phase begins.

Do not proceed to Phase 1 until all of the following are confirmed above:
- "AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED" is written on its own line.
- Axis 1 (duality framing: declarative vs. confirmatory structural roles) is present.
- Axis 2 (audit format: 5-column structure with Evidence-column semantics) is present.
- Axis 3 (derivation direction: L3 Evidence required; Phase 5(3) and CCV prohibited) is present.
A block containing Axes 1 and 2 but omitting Axis 3 fails this gate. A block containing any
two of the three axes while omitting the third fails this gate. Partial axis coverage is not
partial compliance -- it is a gate failure. All three axes must be declared before Phase 1 begins.

---

**Exact-copy rule:** A downstream cite that describes or paraphrases is a paraphrase chain.
A downstream cite that reproduces the artifact label character-for-character is a reference
chain. Only reference chains satisfy the citation requirements.

**Structural prohibition:** Do not produce output in any phase that would require a downstream
phase to paraphrase rather than copy. Return to the phase and emit the required artifact.

**Required architecture label:**

> "CITATION ARCHITECTURE DECLARED. This architecture declares all artifact production
> requirements (rows 1--4), the Citation Chain Completeness Audit requirement (row 5), and
> the AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block with three co-resident axes (Axis 1: duality framing,
> Axis 2: audit format, Axis 3: derivation direction). The block gate instruction in the block
> body names all three axes by label and declares partial axis coverage a gate failure. All
> named artifacts must be produced exactly as declared. All downstream cites must copy upstream
> labels verbatim. AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor from the L3 Evidence column -- not
> from Phase 5(3) or CCV (Axis 3 prohibition). The audit must be produced after Phase 7 and
> must declare CHAIN COMPLETE before the CCV gate may proceed." 

Do not proceed to Phase 1 until this label is written.

---

## Phase 1 -- Scoring Methodology Declaration

Before analyzing any persona, declare the inertia scoring framework.

**Dimension weights:**

| Dimension | Weight (High / Medium / Low) | Why this weight |
|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------|

Dimensions: Workaround satisfaction / Switching cost / Habit lock-in / Social proof requirement
/ Learning curve.

**Score thresholds:**

- **Critical:** [dimension combinations]
- **High:** [combinations]
- **Medium:** [combinations]
- **Low:** [condition all dimensions must satisfy]

**Required infrastructure label** (Citation Architecture row 1):

> "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED. All per-persona methodology traces in Phase 4 must cite
> this Phase 1 output by reference -- naming the specific dimension weights and tier thresholds
> declared above. Traces that reference dimension values without citing thresholds, or
> thresholds without dimension values, fail the per-score trace requirement."

Do not proceed to Phase 2 until written.

---

## Phase 2 -- Persona and Competitive Inventory

Identify 2--4 named personas. For each, treat the current solution as a named competitor.

- Name and role (specific)
- Current solution (named tool or method)
- Outcome the current solution delivers

**Competitive strength inventory per persona:**

| Dimension | Advantage | Durability |
|-----------|-----------|------------|

Durability must name a structural constraint. **Familiarity is not durability.** Structural
constraints: technical, organizational, integration-based, or switching-cost-based.

**Completeness gate:** For each persona: (1) all three fields present; (2) no Durability uses
familiarity/habit -- replace with structural constraint; (3) Dimension names a specific axis.
Do not proceed to Phase 3 until all personas pass all three checks.

**Required inventory label** (Citation Architecture row 2):

> "PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED. Phase 5(2) structural persistence analysis must cite this
> Phase 2 output by reference -- naming the specific Durability property by its Phase 2 label.
> A structural persistence claim that does not name the PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED artifact
> is a paraphrase chain, not a reference chain."

Do not proceed to Phase 3 until written.

---

## Phase 3 -- Inertia Dimension Analysis

| Persona | Workaround satisfaction (H/M/L) | Satisfaction basis (ref. Phase 2) | Switching cost (quantified) | Habit lock-in | Social proof threshold (named condition) | Learning curve |
|---------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|

Switching cost: time, steps, rating 1--10. Qualitative-only fails.
Social proof threshold: named count, role, or condition. Binary Y/N fails.

---

## Phase 4 -- Per-Persona Inertia Scores

| Persona | Score | Methodology trace |
|---------|-------|-------------------|

Methodology trace: (a) name dimension values from Phase 3 + (b) state Phase 1 threshold
satisfied. Cite Phase 1 by copying "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED" (Citation Architecture
row 1). Do not write "Phase 1." Write the artifact name. Every persona scored individually.

---

## Phase 5 -- Kill Barrier: Four-Part Causal Analysis with Reselection Gate

**KILL BARRIER** -- four labeled, distinct sub-parts. Do not merge any two.

**(1) Barrier definition** -- observable adoption friction; state the competitive dimension.
Do not include cause.

**(2) Structural persistence** -- why the barrier persists structurally. Cite PERSONA
INVENTORY DECLARED (Citation Architecture row 2): name the specific Durability property by
its Phase 2 label. A claim without naming the PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED artifact is a
paraphrase chain.

**(3) Intervention target** -- specific lever point. Name the target, not the intervention.

**Required lever label** (Citation Architecture row 3):

> **LEVER POINT: [exact label -- 3--7 words]**

**Falsifiability test:**

> "At T=6mo, the absence of this lever would be observable as: [specific observable
> behavioral or measurable condition]."

Replace Part (3) and repeat if you cannot produce a specific observable condition. Do not
write Part (4) until the test passes.

**(4) Lever efficacy** -- why addressing (3) resolves (2). Explain causally. Reference (2)
by name.

**Temporal persistence confirmation:**

| T=0 exists? | T=18mo persists without structural intervention? |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| YES / NO | YES / NO |

Both must be YES to qualify. If either is NO, return to the top of this phase.

**CONFIRMED KILL BARRIER.** Name the most exposed persona.

---

## Phase 6 -- Adoption Timeline and Kill-Barrier Trajectory Verdict

**Part A disqualifier (required before grid):**

> "This Part A grid captures per-persona trajectory only. It does not satisfy the
> kill-barrier trajectory verdict requirement. That output belongs exclusively to Part B."

| Persona | T=0 | T=6mo | T=18mo | Trajectory | Driver of change |
|---------|-----|-------|--------|------------|-----------------|

At least one trajectory non-flat. T=6mo and T=18mo cannot copy T=0 without a stated reason.

**Part B: KILL-BARRIER TRAJECTORY VERDICT**

**Trajectory direction:** [Resolving / Stable / Worsening]

**Structural reasoning:** [Reference the structural persistence property from Phase 5(2)
by name. Argue from mechanism, not from the per-persona grid.]

**Relationship to Part A:** [Alignment or divergence -- which structural property drives both,
or why they differ.]

**Required trajectory label** (Citation Architecture row 4):

> **TRAJECTORY VERDICT: [exact direction word -- Resolving, Stable, or Worsening]**

Do not proceed to Phase 7 until written.

---

## Phase 7 -- Overall Adoption Inertia Risk

Verdict: Low / Medium / High / Critical.

- Score distribution (e.g., "2 High, 1 Critical")
- Kill-barrier trajectory: copy the exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label (Citation Architecture
  row 4). Do not write "Phase 6 Part B." Write the exact label.
- Competitive summary: kill barrier dimension + Phase 2 structural durability basis
- 1--2 sentence rationale tying score distribution, trajectory, and confirmed kill barrier

---

## Citation Chain Completeness Audit

**(Citation Architecture row 5 -- required before CCV)**

Produce the 5-column audit table using the Axis 2 column structure from AUDIT ARCHITECTURE
DECLARED above. For each link, write the actual downstream cite text in the Evidence column.
Assign Link type and Verdict from that evidence.

| Link | Source artifact | Consumer site | Evidence (write actual downstream cite text) | Link type | Verdict |
|------|----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| L1 | [exact Phase 1 artifact name] | Phase 4 methodology traces | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 4 trace that names the Phase 1 artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L2 | [exact Phase 2 artifact name] | Phase 5(2) structural persistence | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 5(2) that names the Phase 2 artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L3 | [exact LEVER POINT label] | AMEND(d) lever anchor | [write the exact text that WILL appear in AMEND(d)'s "Lever anchor:" field -- this is a forward commitment per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED; AMEND(d) copies from this cell only; Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited sources per Axis 3] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L4 | [exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label] | Phase 7 trajectory cite | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 7 that names the Phase 6 Part B artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |

**Verdict rules:**
- Reference-chain: Evidence reproduces Source artifact label verbatim. Verdict: PASS.
- Description-chain: Evidence describes or paraphrases. Verdict: CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE --
  not "weaker," not "incomplete."
- L3 forward commitment: per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED, the text you write in
  the L3 Evidence cell is the source AMEND(d) copies from. Write the exact "Lever anchor:
  [LEVER POINT label]" text as it will appear. Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited.

**Required aggregate declaration on its own line:**

> "CHAIN COMPLETE: all four links are reference chains."

-- OR --

> "CHAIN BREAK: [list link IDs with CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] -- return to Phase [X] and
> produce the required named artifact before re-auditing."

**Gate rule:** Do not proceed to CCV until CHAIN COMPLETE is written. If CHAIN BREAK, correct
and re-audit.

---

## Citation Chain Verification

Before writing AMEND, complete all six fields with named text.

1. **Phase 1 artifact name:** [exact text produced in Phase 1]
2. **Phase 2 artifact name:** [exact text produced in Phase 2]
3. **Phase 4 citation:** [exact artifact name from (1) as it appears in Phase 4 traces]
4. **Phase 5(2) citation:** [exact artifact name from (2) as it appears in Phase 5(2)]
5. **Phase 5(3) lever label:** [exact LEVER POINT label]
6. **Phase 6 Part B trajectory label:** [exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label]

A field containing "Phase X" or "see above" without the actual artifact name fails.
Correct the upstream phase before proceeding.

---

## AMEND -- Focus, Quantify, Confirm

**Focus persona:** [name -- most exposed to confirmed kill barrier]

**Switching cost (sharpened):** [most precise quantified value]

**Kill barrier for this persona:** [one sentence -- competitive dimension, most acute because]

**Mitigation with full causal chain:**

> **(a) Intervention:** [one concrete action]
>
> **(b) Root cause addressed:** [name the structural condition from Phase 5(2)]
>
> **(c) Causal mechanism:** [why this lever reaches the structural condition in (2). Reference
> the Phase 5(3) lever point by name.]
>
> **(d) Confirmation signal at T=6mo:**
>
> Locate the L3 row of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit above. The Evidence column of
> that row contains the lever anchor text you pre-committed to when you wrote the audit. That
> cell is the derivation authority per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED. Copy its
> contents exactly, character-for-character, into the "Lever anchor:" field below. Do not
> reconstruct the anchor from Phase 5(3). Do not use CCV step (5) as the source. Both are
> prohibited derivation sources per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED. The L3 Evidence
> cell is the one permitted source.
>
> "Lever anchor: [copy the exact text from the L3 Evidence cell of the Citation Chain
> Completeness Audit -- Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE
> DECLARED; do not reconstruct]."
>
> [At T=6mo, the absence of this lever would be observable as: [specific falsifiable
> behavioral or measurable condition]. Must be possible to observe it as absent.]

The lever anchor must reproduce the L3 Evidence cell text exactly. The AMEND section is not
complete without the lever anchor and the observable condition.

---


### V-67: Gate in Produced Label Only (C-41 PARTIAL -- gate displaced from block body)

**Axis:** AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block gate instruction is minimal -- only a completion
trigger naming the artifact label, with zero axis enumeration and no impossibility statement
in the block body. The full per-axis gate (all three axes named by label + impossibility
statement) lives exclusively in the required architecture label. This is the structural shape
from R13 V-65 (C-40 PARTIAL), now tested under the v14 rubric where C-41 exists as an
independent scoring criterion.
**Hypothesis:** C-40 PARTIAL (5 pts) -- block gate names zero axes (PARTIAL condition 1).
C-41 PARTIAL (5 pts) -- per-axis gate present only in produced architecture label (explicit
PARTIAL condition stated in C-41). C-01 through C-39 = 390 pts. Total predicted: 400/410.
**Change from V-64 (R13 ceiling):** Block gate condition stripped to completion trigger only. Required architecture
label expanded to carry the full per-axis gate with impossibility. All phases, CCV, and AMEND
identical to V-66.

## Citation Architecture

Read this section once, in full, before Phase 1 begins. This architecture declares every
named artifact, exact-copy requirement, and derivation direction constraint before any
production phase begins. The three structural axes governing citation chain integrity are
declared in the AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block below. Read the block before Phase 1.

**Named artifacts, required outputs, and verification:**

| # | Phase / Position | Artifact or output | Downstream consumer | Requirement |
|---|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Phase 1 | "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED" | Phase 4 methodology traces | Exact-copy: copy artifact name, not "Phase 1" |
| 2 | Phase 2 | "PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED" | Phase 5(2) structural persistence | Exact-copy: copy artifact name, not "Phase 2" |
| 3 | Phase 5(3) | "LEVER POINT: [label]" | CCV (5); AMEND(d) | Exact-copy: copy the exact label string verbatim. AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor FROM the L3 Evidence column of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit -- the audit is the derivation authority; do not construct from Phase 5(3) and retroactively confirm. |
| 4 | Phase 6 Part B | "TRAJECTORY VERDICT: [direction]" | Phase 7; CCV (6) | Exact-copy: copy the exact direction word |
| 5 | After Phase 7, before CCV | CITATION CHAIN COMPLETENESS AUDIT | Self-verifying | See AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block below; CHAIN COMPLETE gate before CCV |

---

**AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED**

This block declares three co-resident axes. A model reading this block before Phase 1 knows
all three architecture constraints before executing any phase. All three axes are required
content of this block. A block missing any axis is an incomplete architecture declaration.

**Axis 1 -- Duality framing:** This output has two structural artifacts serving distinct and
non-substitutable roles. The Citation Architecture preamble (rows 1--5 above) is declarative:
it specifies what will be produced and how it will be cited before any production phase begins.
The Citation Chain Completeness Audit is confirmatory: it verifies what was produced after all
production phases are complete. These roles are structurally distinct. The preamble cannot
confirm chain integrity because it precedes production. The audit cannot declare artifact names
and exact-copy requirements because those must be known before Phase 1. Neither artifact
substitutes for or subsumes the other's function.

**Axis 2 -- Audit format:** The Citation Chain Completeness Audit (row 5) must use the
following 5-column structure for all four links: Source artifact | Consumer site | Evidence
[write actual downstream cite text verbatim -- for L3, write the exact "Lever anchor:
[LEVER POINT label]" text that will appear in AMEND(d); for L1/L2/L4, write the phrase from
the consuming section that names the source artifact character-for-character; write the actual
text produced, not a description or summary; the Evidence cell must be populated with real
text, not a placeholder] | Link type [Reference-chain if Evidence reproduces source artifact
label verbatim; Description-chain if Evidence describes or paraphrases] | Verdict [PASS for
Reference-chain; CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE for Description-chain -- not "weaker" or
"incomplete"]. Close with "CHAIN COMPLETE: all four links are reference chains" or "CHAIN
BREAK: [list link IDs] -- return to Phase [X] before proceeding."

**Axis 3 -- Derivation direction:** AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor from the L3
Evidence column of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit. Phase 5(3) is a prohibited
derivation source for the lever anchor in AMEND(d). CCV is a prohibited derivation source
for the lever anchor in AMEND(d). The L3 Evidence cell is the one permitted source. AMEND(d)
does not construct the anchor independently and retroactively confirm; it copies from L3
Evidence directly. This derivation direction and these prohibitions are declared at the
architecture-read boundary so that the full constraint -- required source AND forbidden
sources -- is known before any production phase begins.

Do not proceed to Phase 1 until "AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED" is written on its own line above.

---

**Exact-copy rule:** A downstream cite that describes or paraphrases is a paraphrase chain.
A downstream cite that reproduces the artifact label character-for-character is a reference
chain. Only reference chains satisfy the citation requirements.

**Structural prohibition:** Do not produce output in any phase that would require a downstream
phase to paraphrase rather than copy. Return to the phase and emit the required artifact.

**Required architecture label:**

> "CITATION ARCHITECTURE DECLARED. This architecture declares all artifact production
> requirements (rows 1--4), the Citation Chain Completeness Audit requirement (row 5), and
> the AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block with three required axes. The block must contain:
> Axis 1 (duality framing: declarative vs. confirmatory structural roles), Axis 2 (audit
> format: 5-column structure with Evidence-column semantics), Axis 3 (derivation direction:
> L3 Evidence required; Phase 5(3) and CCV prohibited). A block containing Axes 1 and 2 but
> omitting Axis 3 fails its gate. A block containing any two axes while omitting the third
> fails its gate. All named artifacts must be produced exactly as declared. All downstream
> cites must copy upstream labels verbatim. AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor from the
> L3 Evidence column -- not from Phase 5(3) or CCV. The audit must be produced after Phase 7
> and must declare CHAIN COMPLETE before the CCV gate may proceed." 

Do not proceed to Phase 1 until this label is written.

---

## Phase 1 -- Scoring Methodology Declaration

Before analyzing any persona, declare the inertia scoring framework.

**Dimension weights:**

| Dimension | Weight (High / Medium / Low) | Why this weight |
|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------|

Dimensions: Workaround satisfaction / Switching cost / Habit lock-in / Social proof requirement
/ Learning curve.

**Score thresholds:**

- **Critical:** [dimension combinations]
- **High:** [combinations]
- **Medium:** [combinations]
- **Low:** [condition all dimensions must satisfy]

**Required infrastructure label** (Citation Architecture row 1):

> "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED. All per-persona methodology traces in Phase 4 must cite
> this Phase 1 output by reference -- naming the specific dimension weights and tier thresholds
> declared above. Traces that reference dimension values without citing thresholds, or
> thresholds without dimension values, fail the per-score trace requirement."

Do not proceed to Phase 2 until written.

---

## Phase 2 -- Persona and Competitive Inventory

Identify 2--4 named personas. For each, treat the current solution as a named competitor.

- Name and role (specific)
- Current solution (named tool or method)
- Outcome the current solution delivers

**Competitive strength inventory per persona:**

| Dimension | Advantage | Durability |
|-----------|-----------|------------|

Durability must name a structural constraint. **Familiarity is not durability.** Structural
constraints: technical, organizational, integration-based, or switching-cost-based.

**Completeness gate:** For each persona: (1) all three fields present; (2) no Durability uses
familiarity/habit -- replace with structural constraint; (3) Dimension names a specific axis.
Do not proceed to Phase 3 until all personas pass all three checks.

**Required inventory label** (Citation Architecture row 2):

> "PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED. Phase 5(2) structural persistence analysis must cite this
> Phase 2 output by reference -- naming the specific Durability property by its Phase 2 label.
> A structural persistence claim that does not name the PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED artifact
> is a paraphrase chain, not a reference chain."

Do not proceed to Phase 3 until written.

---

## Phase 3 -- Inertia Dimension Analysis

| Persona | Workaround satisfaction (H/M/L) | Satisfaction basis (ref. Phase 2) | Switching cost (quantified) | Habit lock-in | Social proof threshold (named condition) | Learning curve |
|---------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|

Switching cost: time, steps, rating 1--10. Qualitative-only fails.
Social proof threshold: named count, role, or condition. Binary Y/N fails.

---

## Phase 4 -- Per-Persona Inertia Scores

| Persona | Score | Methodology trace |
|---------|-------|-------------------|

Methodology trace: (a) name dimension values from Phase 3 + (b) state Phase 1 threshold
satisfied. Cite Phase 1 by copying "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED" (Citation Architecture
row 1). Do not write "Phase 1." Write the artifact name. Every persona scored individually.

---

## Phase 5 -- Kill Barrier: Four-Part Causal Analysis with Reselection Gate

**KILL BARRIER** -- four labeled, distinct sub-parts. Do not merge any two.

**(1) Barrier definition** -- observable adoption friction; state the competitive dimension.
Do not include cause.

**(2) Structural persistence** -- why the barrier persists structurally. Cite PERSONA
INVENTORY DECLARED (Citation Architecture row 2): name the specific Durability property by
its Phase 2 label. A claim without naming the PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED artifact is a
paraphrase chain.

**(3) Intervention target** -- specific lever point. Name the target, not the intervention.

**Required lever label** (Citation Architecture row 3):

> **LEVER POINT: [exact label -- 3--7 words]**

**Falsifiability test:**

> "At T=6mo, the absence of this lever would be observable as: [specific observable
> behavioral or measurable condition]."

Replace Part (3) and repeat if you cannot produce a specific observable condition. Do not
write Part (4) until the test passes.

**(4) Lever efficacy** -- why addressing (3) resolves (2). Explain causally. Reference (2)
by name.

**Temporal persistence confirmation:**

| T=0 exists? | T=18mo persists without structural intervention? |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| YES / NO | YES / NO |

Both must be YES to qualify. If either is NO, return to the top of this phase.

**CONFIRMED KILL BARRIER.** Name the most exposed persona.

---

## Phase 6 -- Adoption Timeline and Kill-Barrier Trajectory Verdict

**Part A disqualifier (required before grid):**

> "This Part A grid captures per-persona trajectory only. It does not satisfy the
> kill-barrier trajectory verdict requirement. That output belongs exclusively to Part B."

| Persona | T=0 | T=6mo | T=18mo | Trajectory | Driver of change |
|---------|-----|-------|--------|------------|-----------------|

At least one trajectory non-flat. T=6mo and T=18mo cannot copy T=0 without a stated reason.

**Part B: KILL-BARRIER TRAJECTORY VERDICT**

**Trajectory direction:** [Resolving / Stable / Worsening]

**Structural reasoning:** [Reference the structural persistence property from Phase 5(2)
by name. Argue from mechanism, not from the per-persona grid.]

**Relationship to Part A:** [Alignment or divergence -- which structural property drives both,
or why they differ.]

**Required trajectory label** (Citation Architecture row 4):

> **TRAJECTORY VERDICT: [exact direction word -- Resolving, Stable, or Worsening]**

Do not proceed to Phase 7 until written.

---

## Phase 7 -- Overall Adoption Inertia Risk

Verdict: Low / Medium / High / Critical.

- Score distribution (e.g., "2 High, 1 Critical")
- Kill-barrier trajectory: copy the exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label (Citation Architecture
  row 4). Do not write "Phase 6 Part B." Write the exact label.
- Competitive summary: kill barrier dimension + Phase 2 structural durability basis
- 1--2 sentence rationale tying score distribution, trajectory, and confirmed kill barrier

---

## Citation Chain Completeness Audit

**(Citation Architecture row 5 -- required before CCV)**

Produce the 5-column audit table using the Axis 2 column structure from AUDIT ARCHITECTURE
DECLARED above. For each link, write the actual downstream cite text in the Evidence column.
Assign Link type and Verdict from that evidence.

| Link | Source artifact | Consumer site | Evidence (write actual downstream cite text) | Link type | Verdict |
|------|----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| L1 | [exact Phase 1 artifact name] | Phase 4 methodology traces | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 4 trace that names the Phase 1 artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L2 | [exact Phase 2 artifact name] | Phase 5(2) structural persistence | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 5(2) that names the Phase 2 artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L3 | [exact LEVER POINT label] | AMEND(d) lever anchor | [write the exact text that WILL appear in AMEND(d)'s "Lever anchor:" field -- this is a forward commitment per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED; AMEND(d) copies from this cell only; Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited sources per Axis 3] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L4 | [exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label] | Phase 7 trajectory cite | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 7 that names the Phase 6 Part B artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |

**Verdict rules:**
- Reference-chain: Evidence reproduces Source artifact label verbatim. Verdict: PASS.
- Description-chain: Evidence describes or paraphrases. Verdict: CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE --
  not "weaker," not "incomplete."
- L3 forward commitment: per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED, the text you write in
  the L3 Evidence cell is the source AMEND(d) copies from. Write the exact "Lever anchor:
  [LEVER POINT label]" text as it will appear. Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited.

**Required aggregate declaration on its own line:**

> "CHAIN COMPLETE: all four links are reference chains."

-- OR --

> "CHAIN BREAK: [list link IDs with CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] -- return to Phase [X] and
> produce the required named artifact before re-auditing."

**Gate rule:** Do not proceed to CCV until CHAIN COMPLETE is written. If CHAIN BREAK, correct
and re-audit.

---

## Citation Chain Verification

Before writing AMEND, complete all six fields with named text.

1. **Phase 1 artifact name:** [exact text produced in Phase 1]
2. **Phase 2 artifact name:** [exact text produced in Phase 2]
3. **Phase 4 citation:** [exact artifact name from (1) as it appears in Phase 4 traces]
4. **Phase 5(2) citation:** [exact artifact name from (2) as it appears in Phase 5(2)]
5. **Phase 5(3) lever label:** [exact LEVER POINT label]
6. **Phase 6 Part B trajectory label:** [exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label]

A field containing "Phase X" or "see above" without the actual artifact name fails.
Correct the upstream phase before proceeding.

---

## AMEND -- Focus, Quantify, Confirm

**Focus persona:** [name -- most exposed to confirmed kill barrier]

**Switching cost (sharpened):** [most precise quantified value]

**Kill barrier for this persona:** [one sentence -- competitive dimension, most acute because]

**Mitigation with full causal chain:**

> **(a) Intervention:** [one concrete action]
>
> **(b) Root cause addressed:** [name the structural condition from Phase 5(2)]
>
> **(c) Causal mechanism:** [why this lever reaches the structural condition in (2). Reference
> the Phase 5(3) lever point by name.]
>
> **(d) Confirmation signal at T=6mo:**
>
> Locate the L3 row of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit above. The Evidence column of
> that row contains the lever anchor text you pre-committed to when you wrote the audit. That

>
> "Lever anchor: [copy the exact text from the L3 Evidence cell of the Citation Chain

> DECLARED; do not reconstruct]."
>
> [At T=6mo, the absence of this lever would be observable as: [specific falsifiable
> behavioral or measurable condition]. Must be possible to observe it as absent.]

The lever anchor must reproduce the L3 Evidence cell text exactly. The AMEND section is not
complete without the lever anchor and the observable condition.

---


### V-68: Axes in Block Body, Impossibility in Produced Label Only (C-41 split -- axes present, impossibility absent from body)

**Axis:** AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block gate condition enumerates all three axes by
label in the block body but carries no impossibility statement in the block body. The
partial-failure declaration ("a block omitting any axis fails its gate") lives exclusively in
the required architecture label. Block body = axis enumeration + completion trigger only.
Produced label = impossibility statement (no axis enumeration in label).
**Hypothesis:** C-40 PARTIAL (5 pts) -- V-63 case: all three axes named, no impossibility
declaration. C-41 = uncertain. The C-41 criterion requires both axis naming AND impossibility
statement in the block body. V-68 satisfies the axis-naming half (all 3 axes in block body)
but not the impossibility half (in produced label only). Whether genuine-attempt doctrine
yields C-41 PARTIAL (5 pts) -- naming all axes is the harder half -- or C-41 FAIL (0 pts)
is the structural question. Predicted: 395/410 or 400/410.
**Change from V-64 (R13 ceiling):** Block gate condition retains axis enumeration bullets but removes the impossibility
statement lines. Produced label carries the impossibility statement instead. All phases,
CCV, and AMEND identical to V-66.

## Citation Architecture

Read this section once, in full, before Phase 1 begins. This architecture declares every
named artifact, exact-copy requirement, and derivation direction constraint before any
production phase begins. The three structural axes governing citation chain integrity are
declared in the AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block below. Read the block before Phase 1.

**Named artifacts, required outputs, and verification:**

| # | Phase / Position | Artifact or output | Downstream consumer | Requirement |
|---|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Phase 1 | "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED" | Phase 4 methodology traces | Exact-copy: copy artifact name, not "Phase 1" |
| 2 | Phase 2 | "PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED" | Phase 5(2) structural persistence | Exact-copy: copy artifact name, not "Phase 2" |
| 3 | Phase 5(3) | "LEVER POINT: [label]" | CCV (5); AMEND(d) | Exact-copy: copy the exact label string verbatim. AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor FROM the L3 Evidence column of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit -- the audit is the derivation authority; do not construct from Phase 5(3) and retroactively confirm. |
| 4 | Phase 6 Part B | "TRAJECTORY VERDICT: [direction]" | Phase 7; CCV (6) | Exact-copy: copy the exact direction word |
| 5 | After Phase 7, before CCV | CITATION CHAIN COMPLETENESS AUDIT | Self-verifying | See AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block below (Axes 1--3); CHAIN COMPLETE gate before CCV |

---

**AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED**

This block declares three co-resident axes. A model reading this block before Phase 1 knows
all three architecture constraints before executing any phase. All three axes are required
content of this block. A block missing any axis is an incomplete architecture declaration.

**Axis 1 -- Duality framing:** This output has two structural artifacts serving distinct and
non-substitutable roles. The Citation Architecture preamble (rows 1--5 above) is declarative:
it specifies what will be produced and how it will be cited before any production phase begins.
The Citation Chain Completeness Audit is confirmatory: it verifies what was produced after all
production phases are complete. These roles are structurally distinct. The preamble cannot
confirm chain integrity because it precedes production. The audit cannot declare artifact names
and exact-copy requirements because those must be known before Phase 1. Neither artifact
substitutes for or subsumes the other's function.

**Axis 2 -- Audit format:** The Citation Chain Completeness Audit (row 5) must use the
following 5-column structure for all four links: Source artifact | Consumer site | Evidence
[write actual downstream cite text verbatim -- for L3, write the exact "Lever anchor:
[LEVER POINT label]" text that will appear in AMEND(d); for L1/L2/L4, write the phrase from
the consuming section that names the source artifact character-for-character; write the actual
text produced, not a description or summary; the Evidence cell must be populated with real
text, not a placeholder] | Link type [Reference-chain if Evidence reproduces source artifact
label verbatim; Description-chain if Evidence describes or paraphrases] | Verdict [PASS for
Reference-chain; CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE for Description-chain -- not "weaker" or
"incomplete"]. Close with "CHAIN COMPLETE: all four links are reference chains" or "CHAIN
BREAK: [list link IDs] -- return to Phase [X] before proceeding."

**Axis 3 -- Derivation direction:** AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor from the L3
Evidence column of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit. Phase 5(3) is a prohibited
derivation source for the lever anchor in AMEND(d). CCV is a prohibited derivation source
for the lever anchor in AMEND(d). The L3 Evidence cell is the one permitted source. AMEND(d)
does not construct the anchor independently and retroactively confirm; it copies from L3
Evidence directly. This derivation direction and these prohibitions are declared at the
architecture-read boundary so that the full constraint -- required source AND forbidden
sources -- is known before any production phase begins.

Do not proceed to Phase 1 until all of the following are confirmed above:
- "AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED" is written on its own line.
- Axis 1 (duality framing: declarative vs. confirmatory structural roles) is present.
- Axis 2 (audit format: 5-column structure with Evidence-column semantics) is present.
- Axis 3 (derivation direction: L3 Evidence required; Phase 5(3) and CCV prohibited) is present.

---

**Exact-copy rule:** A downstream cite that describes or paraphrases is a paraphrase chain.
A downstream cite that reproduces the artifact label character-for-character is a reference
chain. Only reference chains satisfy the citation requirements.

**Structural prohibition:** Do not produce output in any phase that would require a downstream
phase to paraphrase rather than copy. Return to the phase and emit the required artifact.

**Required architecture label:**

> "CITATION ARCHITECTURE DECLARED. This architecture declares all artifact production
> requirements (rows 1--4), the Citation Chain Completeness Audit requirement (row 5), and
> the AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block with three co-resident axes (Axis 1: duality framing,
> Axis 2: audit format, Axis 3: derivation direction). A block containing Axes 1 and 2 but
> omitting Axis 3 fails its gate. A block containing any two of the three axes while omitting
> the third fails its gate. All named artifacts must be produced exactly as declared. All
> downstream cites must copy upstream labels verbatim. AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor
> from the L3 Evidence column -- not from Phase 5(3) or CCV. The audit must be produced after
> Phase 7 and must declare CHAIN COMPLETE before the CCV gate may proceed." 

Do not proceed to Phase 1 until this label is written.

---

## Phase 1 -- Scoring Methodology Declaration

Before analyzing any persona, declare the inertia scoring framework.

**Dimension weights:**

| Dimension | Weight (High / Medium / Low) | Why this weight |
|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------|

Dimensions: Workaround satisfaction / Switching cost / Habit lock-in / Social proof requirement
/ Learning curve.

**Score thresholds:**

- **Critical:** [dimension combinations]
- **High:** [combinations]
- **Medium:** [combinations]
- **Low:** [condition all dimensions must satisfy]

**Required infrastructure label** (Citation Architecture row 1):

> "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED. All per-persona methodology traces in Phase 4 must cite
> this Phase 1 output by reference -- naming the specific dimension weights and tier thresholds
> declared above. Traces that reference dimension values without citing thresholds, or
> thresholds without dimension values, fail the per-score trace requirement."

Do not proceed to Phase 2 until written.

---

## Phase 2 -- Persona and Competitive Inventory

Identify 2--4 named personas. For each, treat the current solution as a named competitor.

- Name and role (specific)
- Current solution (named tool or method)
- Outcome the current solution delivers

**Competitive strength inventory per persona:**

| Dimension | Advantage | Durability |
|-----------|-----------|------------|

Durability must name a structural constraint. **Familiarity is not durability.** Structural
constraints: technical, organizational, integration-based, or switching-cost-based.

**Completeness gate:** For each persona: (1) all three fields present; (2) no Durability uses
familiarity/habit -- replace with structural constraint; (3) Dimension names a specific axis.
Do not proceed to Phase 3 until all personas pass all three checks.

**Required inventory label** (Citation Architecture row 2):

> "PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED. Phase 5(2) structural persistence analysis must cite this
> Phase 2 output by reference -- naming the specific Durability property by its Phase 2 label.
> A structural persistence claim that does not name the PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED artifact
> is a paraphrase chain, not a reference chain."

Do not proceed to Phase 3 until written.

---

## Phase 3 -- Inertia Dimension Analysis

| Persona | Workaround satisfaction (H/M/L) | Satisfaction basis (ref. Phase 2) | Switching cost (quantified) | Habit lock-in | Social proof threshold (named condition) | Learning curve |
|---------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|

Switching cost: time, steps, rating 1--10. Qualitative-only fails.
Social proof threshold: named count, role, or condition. Binary Y/N fails.

---

## Phase 4 -- Per-Persona Inertia Scores

| Persona | Score | Methodology trace |
|---------|-------|-------------------|

Methodology trace: (a) name dimension values from Phase 3 + (b) state Phase 1 threshold
satisfied. Cite Phase 1 by copying "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED" (Citation Architecture
row 1). Do not write "Phase 1." Write the artifact name. Every persona scored individually.

---

## Phase 5 -- Kill Barrier: Four-Part Causal Analysis with Reselection Gate

**KILL BARRIER** -- four labeled, distinct sub-parts. Do not merge any two.

**(1) Barrier definition** -- observable adoption friction; state the competitive dimension.
Do not include cause.

**(2) Structural persistence** -- why the barrier persists structurally. Cite PERSONA
INVENTORY DECLARED (Citation Architecture row 2): name the specific Durability property by
its Phase 2 label. A claim without naming the PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED artifact is a
paraphrase chain.

**(3) Intervention target** -- specific lever point. Name the target, not the intervention.

**Required lever label** (Citation Architecture row 3):

> **LEVER POINT: [exact label -- 3--7 words]**

**Falsifiability test:**

> "At T=6mo, the absence of this lever would be observable as: [specific observable
> behavioral or measurable condition]."

Replace Part (3) and repeat if you cannot produce a specific observable condition. Do not
write Part (4) until the test passes.

**(4) Lever efficacy** -- why addressing (3) resolves (2). Explain causally. Reference (2)
by name.

**Temporal persistence confirmation:**

| T=0 exists? | T=18mo persists without structural intervention? |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| YES / NO | YES / NO |

Both must be YES to qualify. If either is NO, return to the top of this phase.

**CONFIRMED KILL BARRIER.** Name the most exposed persona.

---

## Phase 6 -- Adoption Timeline and Kill-Barrier Trajectory Verdict

**Part A disqualifier (required before grid):**

> "This Part A grid captures per-persona trajectory only. It does not satisfy the
> kill-barrier trajectory verdict requirement. That output belongs exclusively to Part B."

| Persona | T=0 | T=6mo | T=18mo | Trajectory | Driver of change |
|---------|-----|-------|--------|------------|-----------------|

At least one trajectory non-flat. T=6mo and T=18mo cannot copy T=0 without a stated reason.

**Part B: KILL-BARRIER TRAJECTORY VERDICT**

**Trajectory direction:** [Resolving / Stable / Worsening]

**Structural reasoning:** [Reference the structural persistence property from Phase 5(2)
by name. Argue from mechanism, not from the per-persona grid.]

**Relationship to Part A:** [Alignment or divergence -- which structural property drives both,
or why they differ.]

**Required trajectory label** (Citation Architecture row 4):

> **TRAJECTORY VERDICT: [exact direction word -- Resolving, Stable, or Worsening]**

Do not proceed to Phase 7 until written.

---

## Phase 7 -- Overall Adoption Inertia Risk

Verdict: Low / Medium / High / Critical.

- Score distribution (e.g., "2 High, 1 Critical")
- Kill-barrier trajectory: copy the exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label (Citation Architecture
  row 4). Do not write "Phase 6 Part B." Write the exact label.
- Competitive summary: kill barrier dimension + Phase 2 structural durability basis
- 1--2 sentence rationale tying score distribution, trajectory, and confirmed kill barrier

---

## Citation Chain Completeness Audit

**(Citation Architecture row 5 -- required before CCV)**

Produce the 5-column audit table using the Axis 2 column structure from AUDIT ARCHITECTURE
DECLARED above. For each link, write the actual downstream cite text in the Evidence column.
Assign Link type and Verdict from that evidence.

| Link | Source artifact | Consumer site | Evidence (write actual downstream cite text) | Link type | Verdict |
|------|----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| L1 | [exact Phase 1 artifact name] | Phase 4 methodology traces | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 4 trace that names the Phase 1 artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L2 | [exact Phase 2 artifact name] | Phase 5(2) structural persistence | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 5(2) that names the Phase 2 artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L3 | [exact LEVER POINT label] | AMEND(d) lever anchor | [write the exact text that WILL appear in AMEND(d)'s "Lever anchor:" field -- this is a forward commitment per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED; AMEND(d) copies from this cell only; Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited sources per Axis 3] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L4 | [exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label] | Phase 7 trajectory cite | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 7 that names the Phase 6 Part B artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |

**Verdict rules:**
- Reference-chain: Evidence reproduces Source artifact label verbatim. Verdict: PASS.
- Description-chain: Evidence describes or paraphrases. Verdict: CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE --
  not "weaker," not "incomplete."
- L3 forward commitment: per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED, the text you write in
  the L3 Evidence cell is the source AMEND(d) copies from. Write the exact "Lever anchor:
  [LEVER POINT label]" text as it will appear. Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited.

**Required aggregate declaration on its own line:**

> "CHAIN COMPLETE: all four links are reference chains."

-- OR --

> "CHAIN BREAK: [list link IDs with CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] -- return to Phase [X] and
> produce the required named artifact before re-auditing."

**Gate rule:** Do not proceed to CCV until CHAIN COMPLETE is written. If CHAIN BREAK, correct
and re-audit.

---

## Citation Chain Verification

Before writing AMEND, complete all six fields with named text.

1. **Phase 1 artifact name:** [exact text produced in Phase 1]
2. **Phase 2 artifact name:** [exact text produced in Phase 2]
3. **Phase 4 citation:** [exact artifact name from (1) as it appears in Phase 4 traces]
4. **Phase 5(2) citation:** [exact artifact name from (2) as it appears in Phase 5(2)]
5. **Phase 5(3) lever label:** [exact LEVER POINT label]
6. **Phase 6 Part B trajectory label:** [exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label]

A field containing "Phase X" or "see above" without the actual artifact name fails.
Correct the upstream phase before proceeding.

---

## AMEND -- Focus, Quantify, Confirm

**Focus persona:** [name -- most exposed to confirmed kill barrier]

**Switching cost (sharpened):** [most precise quantified value]

**Kill barrier for this persona:** [one sentence -- competitive dimension, most acute because]

**Mitigation with full causal chain:**

> **(a) Intervention:** [one concrete action]
>
> **(b) Root cause addressed:** [name the structural condition from Phase 5(2)]
>
> **(c) Causal mechanism:** [why this lever reaches the structural condition in (2). Reference
> the Phase 5(3) lever point by name.]
>
> **(d) Confirmation signal at T=6mo:**
>
> Locate the L3 row of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit above. The Evidence column of

> behavioral or measurable condition]. Must be possible to observe it as absent.]

The lever anchor must reproduce the L3 Evidence cell text exactly. The AMEND section is not
complete without the lever anchor and the observable condition.

---


### V-69: Impossibility in Block Body, Axes in Produced Label Only (C-41 split -- impossibility present, axis enumeration absent from body)

**Axis:** AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block gate condition declares the impossibility clause
in the block body ("a block containing any two constraints while omitting the third is a gate
failure") but names no individual axes by label in the block body gate. The per-axis
enumeration (Axis 1, Axis 2, Axis 3 each named) lives exclusively in the required architecture
label. This is the structural mirror of V-68: V-68 puts axis labels in the body without
impossibility; V-69 puts impossibility in the body without axis labels.
**Hypothesis:** C-40 PARTIAL (5 pts) -- PARTIAL condition 2: partial-failure declared without
naming individual axes (impossibility in body, axes absent from body gate). C-41 = likely
FAIL (0 pts). The C-41 PARTIAL condition names "per-axis gate present only in the produced
architecture label" -- V-69's block body has the impossibility but not the axis labels, which
is neither the PASS shape (full gate in body) nor the explicit PARTIAL shape (full per-axis
gate in label only). FAIL is more likely than PARTIAL. Predicted: 395/410 or 400/410.
**Change from V-64 (R13 ceiling):** Block gate condition removes all axis enumeration bullets, retaining only the
impossibility statement as a general constraint. Produced label carries the per-axis
enumeration (all 3 axes named) plus restates impossibility. All phases, CCV, and AMEND
identical to V-66.

## Citation Architecture

Read this section once, in full, before Phase 1 begins. This architecture declares every
named artifact, exact-copy requirement, and derivation direction constraint before any
production phase begins. The three structural axes governing citation chain integrity are
declared in the AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block below. Read the block before Phase 1.

**Named artifacts, required outputs, and verification:**

| # | Phase / Position | Artifact or output | Downstream consumer | Requirement |
|---|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Phase 1 | "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED" | Phase 4 methodology traces | Exact-copy: copy artifact name, not "Phase 1" |
| 2 | Phase 2 | "PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED" | Phase 5(2) structural persistence | Exact-copy: copy artifact name, not "Phase 2" |
| 3 | Phase 5(3) | "LEVER POINT: [label]" | CCV (5); AMEND(d) | Exact-copy: copy the exact label string verbatim. AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor FROM the L3 Evidence column of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit -- the audit is the derivation authority; do not construct from Phase 5(3) and retroactively confirm. |
| 4 | Phase 6 Part B | "TRAJECTORY VERDICT: [direction]" | Phase 7; CCV (6) | Exact-copy: copy the exact direction word |
| 5 | After Phase 7, before CCV | CITATION CHAIN COMPLETENESS AUDIT | Self-verifying | See AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block below (three required constraints); CHAIN COMPLETE gate before CCV |

---

**AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED**

This block declares three co-resident constraints. A model reading this block before Phase 1
knows all three architecture constraints before executing any phase. All three constraints are
required content of this block. A block missing any constraint is an incomplete architecture
declaration.

**Axis 1 -- Duality framing:** This output has two structural artifacts serving distinct and
non-substitutable roles. The Citation Architecture preamble (rows 1--5 above) is declarative:
it specifies what will be produced and how it will be cited before any production phase begins.
The Citation Chain Completeness Audit is confirmatory: it verifies what was produced after all
production phases are complete. These roles are structurally distinct. The preamble cannot
confirm chain integrity because it precedes production. The audit cannot declare artifact names
and exact-copy requirements because those must be known before Phase 1. Neither artifact
substitutes for or subsumes the other's function.

**Axis 2 -- Audit format:** The Citation Chain Completeness Audit (row 5) must use the
following 5-column structure for all four links: Source artifact | Consumer site | Evidence
[write actual downstream cite text verbatim -- for L3, write the exact "Lever anchor:
[LEVER POINT label]" text that will appear in AMEND(d); for L1/L2/L4, write the phrase from
the consuming section that names the source artifact character-for-character; write the actual
text produced, not a description or summary; the Evidence cell must be populated with real
text, not a placeholder] | Link type [Reference-chain if Evidence reproduces source artifact
label verbatim; Description-chain if Evidence describes or paraphrases] | Verdict [PASS for
Reference-chain; CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE for Description-chain -- not "weaker" or
"incomplete"]. Close with "CHAIN COMPLETE: all four links are reference chains" or "CHAIN
BREAK: [list link IDs] -- return to Phase [X] before proceeding."

**Axis 3 -- Derivation direction:** AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor from the L3
Evidence column of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit. Phase 5(3) is a prohibited
derivation source for the lever anchor in AMEND(d). CCV is a prohibited derivation source
for the lever anchor in AMEND(d). The L3 Evidence cell is the one permitted source. AMEND(d)
does not construct the anchor independently and retroactively confirm; it copies from L3
Evidence directly. This derivation direction and these prohibitions are declared at the
architecture-read boundary so that the full constraint -- required source AND forbidden
sources -- is known before any production phase begins.

Do not proceed to Phase 1 until "AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED" is written on its own line
above. This block must contain all three required constraints to proceed. A block containing
any two constraints while omitting the third is a gate failure -- partial block content is
not partial compliance. Complete all three constraints before Phase 1 begins.

---

**Exact-copy rule:** A downstream cite that describes or paraphrases is a paraphrase chain.
A downstream cite that reproduces the artifact label character-for-character is a reference
chain. Only reference chains satisfy the citation requirements.

**Structural prohibition:** Do not produce output in any phase that would require a downstream
phase to paraphrase rather than copy. Return to the phase and emit the required artifact.

**Required architecture label:**

> "CITATION ARCHITECTURE DECLARED. This architecture declares all artifact production
> requirements (rows 1--4), the Citation Chain Completeness Audit requirement (row 5), and
> the AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block with three co-resident constraints. The three required
> constraints are: Axis 1 (duality framing: declarative vs. confirmatory structural roles),
> Axis 2 (audit format: 5-column structure with Evidence-column semantics), Axis 3 (derivation
> direction: L3 Evidence required; Phase 5(3) and CCV prohibited). A block containing Axes 1
> and 2 but omitting Axis 3 fails its gate; the impossibility clause is declared in the block
> instruction. All named artifacts must be produced exactly as declared. All downstream cites
> must copy upstream labels verbatim. AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor from the L3
> Evidence column -- not from Phase 5(3) or CCV. The audit must be produced after Phase 7
> and must declare CHAIN COMPLETE before the CCV gate may proceed." 

Do not proceed to Phase 1 until this label is written.

## Phase 1 -- Scoring Methodology Declaration

Before analyzing any persona, declare the inertia scoring framework.

**Dimension weights:**

| Dimension | Weight (High / Medium / Low) | Why this weight |
|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------|

Dimensions: Workaround satisfaction / Switching cost / Habit lock-in / Social proof requirement
/ Learning curve.

**Score thresholds:**

- **Critical:** [dimension combinations]
- **High:** [combinations]
- **Medium:** [combinations]
- **Low:** [condition all dimensions must satisfy]

**Required infrastructure label** (Citation Architecture row 1):

> "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED. All per-persona methodology traces in Phase 4 must cite
> this Phase 1 output by reference -- naming the specific dimension weights and tier thresholds
> declared above. Traces that reference dimension values without citing thresholds, or
> thresholds without dimension values, fail the per-score trace requirement."

Do not proceed to Phase 2 until written.

---

## Phase 2 -- Persona and Competitive Inventory

Identify 2--4 named personas. For each, treat the current solution as a named competitor.

- Name and role (specific)
- Current solution (named tool or method)
- Outcome the current solution delivers

**Competitive strength inventory per persona:**

| Dimension | Advantage | Durability |
|-----------|-----------|------------|

Durability must name a structural constraint. **Familiarity is not durability.** Structural
constraints: technical, organizational, integration-based, or switching-cost-based.

**Completeness gate:** For each persona: (1) all three fields present; (2) no Durability uses
familiarity/habit -- replace with structural constraint; (3) Dimension names a specific axis.
Do not proceed to Phase 3 until all personas pass all three checks.

**Required inventory label** (Citation Architecture row 2):

> "PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED. Phase 5(2) structural persistence analysis must cite this
> Phase 2 output by reference -- naming the specific Durability property by its Phase 2 label.
> A structural persistence claim that does not name the PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED artifact
> is a paraphrase chain, not a reference chain."

Do not proceed to Phase 3 until written.

---

## Phase 3 -- Inertia Dimension Analysis

| Persona | Workaround satisfaction (H/M/L) | Satisfaction basis (ref. Phase 2) | Switching cost (quantified) | Habit lock-in | Social proof threshold (named condition) | Learning curve |
|---------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|

Switching cost: time, steps, rating 1--10. Qualitative-only fails.
Social proof threshold: named count, role, or condition. Binary Y/N fails.

---

## Phase 4 -- Per-Persona Inertia Scores

| Persona | Score | Methodology trace |
|---------|-------|-------------------|

Methodology trace: (a) name dimension values from Phase 3 + (b) state Phase 1 threshold
satisfied. Cite Phase 1 by copying "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED" (Citation Architecture
row 1). Do not write "Phase 1." Write the artifact name. Every persona scored individually.

---

## Phase 5 -- Kill Barrier: Four-Part Causal Analysis with Reselection Gate

**KILL BARRIER** -- four labeled, distinct sub-parts. Do not merge any two.

**(1) Barrier definition** -- observable adoption friction; state the competitive dimension.
Do not include cause.

**(2) Structural persistence** -- why the barrier persists structurally. Cite PERSONA
INVENTORY DECLARED (Citation Architecture row 2): name the specific Durability property by
its Phase 2 label. A claim without naming the PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED artifact is a
paraphrase chain.

**(3) Intervention target** -- specific lever point. Name the target, not the intervention.

**Required lever label** (Citation Architecture row 3):

> **LEVER POINT: [exact label -- 3--7 words]**

**Falsifiability test:**

> "At T=6mo, the absence of this lever would be observable as: [specific observable
> behavioral or measurable condition]."

Replace Part (3) and repeat if you cannot produce a specific observable condition. Do not
write Part (4) until the test passes.

**(4) Lever efficacy** -- why addressing (3) resolves (2). Explain causally. Reference (2)
by name.

**Temporal persistence confirmation:**

| T=0 exists? | T=18mo persists without structural intervention? |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| YES / NO | YES / NO |

Both must be YES to qualify. If either is NO, return to the top of this phase.

**CONFIRMED KILL BARRIER.** Name the most exposed persona.

---

## Phase 6 -- Adoption Timeline and Kill-Barrier Trajectory Verdict

**Part A disqualifier (required before grid):**

> "This Part A grid captures per-persona trajectory only. It does not satisfy the
> kill-barrier trajectory verdict requirement. That output belongs exclusively to Part B."

| Persona | T=0 | T=6mo | T=18mo | Trajectory | Driver of change |
|---------|-----|-------|--------|------------|-----------------|

At least one trajectory non-flat. T=6mo and T=18mo cannot copy T=0 without a stated reason.

**Part B: KILL-BARRIER TRAJECTORY VERDICT**

**Trajectory direction:** [Resolving / Stable / Worsening]

**Structural reasoning:** [Reference the structural persistence property from Phase 5(2)
by name. Argue from mechanism, not from the per-persona grid.]

**Relationship to Part A:** [Alignment or divergence -- which structural property drives both,
or why they differ.]

**Required trajectory label** (Citation Architecture row 4):

> **TRAJECTORY VERDICT: [exact direction word -- Resolving, Stable, or Worsening]**

Do not proceed to Phase 7 until written.

---

## Phase 7 -- Overall Adoption Inertia Risk

Verdict: Low / Medium / High / Critical.

- Score distribution (e.g., "2 High, 1 Critical")
- Kill-barrier trajectory: copy the exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label (Citation Architecture
  row 4). Do not write "Phase 6 Part B." Write the exact label.
- Competitive summary: kill barrier dimension + Phase 2 structural durability basis
- 1--2 sentence rationale tying score distribution, trajectory, and confirmed kill barrier

---

## Citation Chain Completeness Audit

**(Citation Architecture row 5 -- required before CCV)**

Produce the 5-column audit table using the Axis 2 column structure from AUDIT ARCHITECTURE
DECLARED above. For each link, write the actual downstream cite text in the Evidence column.
Assign Link type and Verdict from that evidence.

| Link | Source artifact | Consumer site | Evidence (write actual downstream cite text) | Link type | Verdict |
|------|----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| L1 | [exact Phase 1 artifact name] | Phase 4 methodology traces | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 4 trace that names the Phase 1 artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L2 | [exact Phase 2 artifact name] | Phase 5(2) structural persistence | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 5(2) that names the Phase 2 artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L3 | [exact LEVER POINT label] | AMEND(d) lever anchor | [write the exact text that WILL appear in AMEND(d)'s "Lever anchor:" field -- this is a forward commitment per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED; AMEND(d) copies from this cell only; Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited sources per Axis 3] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L4 | [exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label] | Phase 7 trajectory cite | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 7 that names the Phase 6 Part B artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |

**Verdict rules:**
- Reference-chain: Evidence reproduces Source artifact label verbatim. Verdict: PASS.
- Description-chain: Evidence describes or paraphrases. Verdict: CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE --
  not "weaker," not "incomplete."
- L3 forward commitment: per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED, the text you write in
  the L3 Evidence cell is the source AMEND(d) copies from. Write the exact "Lever anchor:
  [LEVER POINT label]" text as it will appear. Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited.

**Required aggregate declaration on its own line:**

> "CHAIN COMPLETE: all four links are reference chains."

-- OR --

> "CHAIN BREAK: [list link IDs with CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] -- return to Phase [X] and
> produce the required named artifact before re-auditing."

**Gate rule:** Do not proceed to CCV until CHAIN COMPLETE is written. If CHAIN BREAK, correct
and re-audit.

---

## Citation Chain Verification

Before writing AMEND, complete all six fields with named text.

1. **Phase 1 artifact name:** [exact text produced in Phase 1]
2. **Phase 2 artifact name:** [exact text produced in Phase 2]
3. **Phase 4 citation:** [exact artifact name from (1) as it appears in Phase 4 traces]
4. **Phase 5(2) citation:** [exact artifact name from (2) as it appears in Phase 5(2)]
5. **Phase 5(3) lever label:** [exact LEVER POINT label]
6. **Phase 6 Part B trajectory label:** [exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label]

A field containing "Phase X" or "see above" without the actual artifact name fails.
Correct the upstream phase before proceeding.

---

## AMEND -- Focus, Quantify, Confirm

**Focus persona:** [name -- most exposed to confirmed kill barrier]

**Switching cost (sharpened):** [most precise quantified value]

**Kill barrier for this persona:** [one sentence -- competitive dimension, most acute because]

**Mitigation with full causal chain:**

> **(a) Intervention:** [one concrete action]
>
> **(b) Root cause addressed:** [name the structural condition from Phase 5(2)]
>
> **(c) Causal mechanism:** [why this lever reaches the structural condition in (2). Reference
> the Phase 5(3) lever point by name.]
>
> **(d) Confirmation signal at T=6mo:**
>
> Locate the L3 row of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit above. The Evidence column of
> that row contains the lever anchor text you pre-committed to when you wrote the audit. That
> cell is the derivation authority per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED. Copy its
> contents exactly, character-for-character, into the "Lever anchor:" field below. Do not
> reconstruct the anchor from Phase 5(3). Do not use CCV step (5) as the source. Both are

>
> "Lever anchor: [copy the exact text from the L3 Evidence cell of the Citation Chain
> Completeness Audit -- Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE
> DECLARED; do not reconstruct]."
>
> [At T=6mo, the absence of this lever would be observable as: [specific falsifiable
> behavioral or measurable condition]. Must be possible to observe it as absent.]

The lever anchor must reproduce the L3 Evidence cell text exactly. The AMEND section is not
complete without the lever anchor and the observable condition.

---


### V-70: Redundant Dual-Site Gate -- Full Gate in Block Body AND Produced Label (C-41 redundancy test)

**Axis:** AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block gate condition is identical to V-66 -- full
per-axis enumeration (all 3 axes named) plus comprehensive impossibility statement in the
block instruction body. Additionally, the required architecture label also restates the full
per-axis gate with all three axes named and the impossibility statement -- redundant dual-site
gate enforcement. Both the block body and the produced label carry the complete C-40 gate.
**Hypothesis:** C-40 PASS (10 pts) -- all three axes named + impossibility in block body.
C-41 PASS (10 pts) -- per-axis gate is present in block body (read-time enforcement
satisfied); the additional presence in the produced label does not change the placement
verdict. C-01 through C-39 = 390 pts. Total predicted: 410/410.
**Change from V-64 (R13 ceiling):** Required architecture label expanded to carry the full per-axis gate (all 3 axes
+ impossibility) rather than a summary reference. Block gate condition unchanged from V-66.
All phases, CCV, and AMEND identical to V-66.

## Citation Architecture

Read this section once, in full, before Phase 1 begins. This architecture declares every
named artifact, exact-copy requirement, and derivation direction constraint before any
production phase begins. The three structural axes governing citation chain integrity are
declared in the AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block below. Read the block before Phase 1.

**Named artifacts, required outputs, and verification:**

| # | Phase / Position | Artifact or output | Downstream consumer | Requirement |
|---|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Phase 1 | "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED" | Phase 4 methodology traces | Exact-copy: copy artifact name, not "Phase 1" |
| 2 | Phase 2 | "PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED" | Phase 5(2) structural persistence | Exact-copy: copy artifact name, not "Phase 2" |
| 3 | Phase 5(3) | "LEVER POINT: [label]" | CCV (5); AMEND(d) | Exact-copy: copy the exact label string verbatim. AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor FROM the L3 Evidence column of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit -- the audit is the derivation authority; do not construct from Phase 5(3) and retroactively confirm. |
| 4 | Phase 6 Part B | "TRAJECTORY VERDICT: [direction]" | Phase 7; CCV (6) | Exact-copy: copy the exact direction word |
| 5 | After Phase 7, before CCV | CITATION CHAIN COMPLETENESS AUDIT | Self-verifying | See AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block below (Axes 1--3); CHAIN COMPLETE gate before CCV |

---

**AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED**

This block declares three co-resident axes. A model reading this block before Phase 1 knows
all three architecture constraints before executing any phase. All three axes are required
content of this block. A block missing any axis is an incomplete architecture declaration.

**Axis 1 -- Duality framing:** This output has two structural artifacts serving distinct and
non-substitutable roles. The Citation Architecture preamble (rows 1--5 above) is declarative:
it specifies what will be produced and how it will be cited before any production phase begins.
The Citation Chain Completeness Audit is confirmatory: it verifies what was produced after all
production phases are complete. These roles are structurally distinct. The preamble cannot
confirm chain integrity because it precedes production. The audit cannot declare artifact names
and exact-copy requirements because those must be known before Phase 1. Neither artifact
substitutes for or subsumes the other's function.

**Axis 2 -- Audit format:** The Citation Chain Completeness Audit (row 5) must use the
following 5-column structure for all four links: Source artifact | Consumer site | Evidence
[write actual downstream cite text verbatim -- for L3, write the exact "Lever anchor:
[LEVER POINT label]" text that will appear in AMEND(d); for L1/L2/L4, write the phrase from
the consuming section that names the source artifact character-for-character; write the actual
text produced, not a description or summary; the Evidence cell must be populated with real
text, not a placeholder] | Link type [Reference-chain if Evidence reproduces source artifact
label verbatim; Description-chain if Evidence describes or paraphrases] | Verdict [PASS for
Reference-chain; CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE for Description-chain -- not "weaker" or
"incomplete"]. Close with "CHAIN COMPLETE: all four links are reference chains" or "CHAIN
BREAK: [list link IDs] -- return to Phase [X] before proceeding."

**Axis 3 -- Derivation direction:** AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor from the L3
Evidence column of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit. Phase 5(3) is a prohibited
derivation source for the lever anchor in AMEND(d). CCV is a prohibited derivation source
for the lever anchor in AMEND(d). The L3 Evidence cell is the one permitted source. AMEND(d)
does not construct the anchor independently and retroactively confirm; it copies from L3
Evidence directly. This derivation direction and these prohibitions are declared at the
architecture-read boundary so that the full constraint -- required source AND forbidden
sources -- is known before any production phase begins.

Do not proceed to Phase 1 until all of the following are confirmed above:
- "AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED" is written on its own line.
- Axis 1 (duality framing: declarative vs. confirmatory structural roles) is present.
- Axis 2 (audit format: 5-column structure with Evidence-column semantics) is present.
- Axis 3 (derivation direction: L3 Evidence required; Phase 5(3) and CCV prohibited) is present.
A block containing Axes 1 and 2 but omitting Axis 3 fails this gate. A block containing any
two of the three axes while omitting the third fails this gate. Partial axis coverage is not
partial compliance -- it is a gate failure. All three axes must be declared before Phase 1 begins.

---

**Exact-copy rule:** A downstream cite that describes or paraphrases is a paraphrase chain.
A downstream cite that reproduces the artifact label character-for-character is a reference
chain. Only reference chains satisfy the citation requirements.

**Structural prohibition:** Do not produce output in any phase that would require a downstream
phase to paraphrase rather than copy. Return to the phase and emit the required artifact.

**Required architecture label:**

> "CITATION ARCHITECTURE DECLARED. This architecture declares all artifact production
> requirements (rows 1--4), the Citation Chain Completeness Audit requirement (row 5), and
> the AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED block with three co-resident axes. The block gate declared
> in the block instruction body names each axis by label and declares partial axis omission a
> gate failure: Axis 1 (duality framing: declarative vs. confirmatory structural roles),
> Axis 2 (audit format: 5-column structure with Evidence-column semantics), Axis 3 (derivation
> direction: L3 Evidence required; Phase 5(3) and CCV prohibited). A block containing Axes 1
> and 2 but omitting Axis 3 fails the block gate -- this impossibility applies at both the
> block instruction (read-time) and this architecture label (emit-time). All named artifacts
> must be produced exactly as declared. All downstream cites must copy upstream labels
> verbatim. AMEND(d) must derive its lever anchor from the L3 Evidence column -- not from
> Phase 5(3) or CCV (Axis 3 prohibition). The audit must be produced after Phase 7 and must
> declare CHAIN COMPLETE before the CCV gate may proceed." 

Do not proceed to Phase 1 until this label is written.

---

## Phase 1 -- Scoring Methodology Declaration

Before analyzing any persona, declare the inertia scoring framework.

**Dimension weights:**

| Dimension | Weight (High / Medium / Low) | Why this weight |
|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------|

Dimensions: Workaround satisfaction / Switching cost / Habit lock-in / Social proof requirement
/ Learning curve.

**Score thresholds:**

- **Critical:** [dimension combinations]
- **High:** [combinations]
- **Medium:** [combinations]
- **Low:** [condition all dimensions must satisfy]

**Required infrastructure label** (Citation Architecture row 1):

> "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED. All per-persona methodology traces in Phase 4 must cite
> this Phase 1 output by reference -- naming the specific dimension weights and tier thresholds
> declared above. Traces that reference dimension values without citing thresholds, or
> thresholds without dimension values, fail the per-score trace requirement."

Do not proceed to Phase 2 until written.

---

## Phase 2 -- Persona and Competitive Inventory

Identify 2--4 named personas. For each, treat the current solution as a named competitor.

- Name and role (specific)
- Current solution (named tool or method)
- Outcome the current solution delivers

**Competitive strength inventory per persona:**

| Dimension | Advantage | Durability |
|-----------|-----------|------------|

Durability must name a structural constraint. **Familiarity is not durability.** Structural
constraints: technical, organizational, integration-based, or switching-cost-based.

**Completeness gate:** For each persona: (1) all three fields present; (2) no Durability uses
familiarity/habit -- replace with structural constraint; (3) Dimension names a specific axis.
Do not proceed to Phase 3 until all personas pass all three checks.

**Required inventory label** (Citation Architecture row 2):

> "PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED. Phase 5(2) structural persistence analysis must cite this
> Phase 2 output by reference -- naming the specific Durability property by its Phase 2 label.
> A structural persistence claim that does not name the PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED artifact
> is a paraphrase chain, not a reference chain."

Do not proceed to Phase 3 until written.

---

## Phase 3 -- Inertia Dimension Analysis

| Persona | Workaround satisfaction (H/M/L) | Satisfaction basis (ref. Phase 2) | Switching cost (quantified) | Habit lock-in | Social proof threshold (named condition) | Learning curve |
|---------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|----------------|

Switching cost: time, steps, rating 1--10. Qualitative-only fails.
Social proof threshold: named count, role, or condition. Binary Y/N fails.

---

## Phase 4 -- Per-Persona Inertia Scores

| Persona | Score | Methodology trace |
|---------|-------|-------------------|

Methodology trace: (a) name dimension values from Phase 3 + (b) state Phase 1 threshold
satisfied. Cite Phase 1 by copying "SCORING INFRASTRUCTURE DECLARED" (Citation Architecture
row 1). Do not write "Phase 1." Write the artifact name. Every persona scored individually.

---

## Phase 5 -- Kill Barrier: Four-Part Causal Analysis with Reselection Gate

**KILL BARRIER** -- four labeled, distinct sub-parts. Do not merge any two.

**(1) Barrier definition** -- observable adoption friction; state the competitive dimension.
Do not include cause.

**(2) Structural persistence** -- why the barrier persists structurally. Cite PERSONA
INVENTORY DECLARED (Citation Architecture row 2): name the specific Durability property by
its Phase 2 label. A claim without naming the PERSONA INVENTORY DECLARED artifact is a
paraphrase chain.

**(3) Intervention target** -- specific lever point. Name the target, not the intervention.

**Required lever label** (Citation Architecture row 3):

> **LEVER POINT: [exact label -- 3--7 words]**

**Falsifiability test:**

> "At T=6mo, the absence of this lever would be observable as: [specific observable
> behavioral or measurable condition]."

Replace Part (3) and repeat if you cannot produce a specific observable condition. Do not
write Part (4) until the test passes.

**(4) Lever efficacy** -- why addressing (3) resolves (2). Explain causally. Reference (2)
by name.

**Temporal persistence confirmation:**

| T=0 exists? | T=18mo persists without structural intervention? |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| YES / NO | YES / NO |

Both must be YES to qualify. If either is NO, return to the top of this phase.

**CONFIRMED KILL BARRIER.** Name the most exposed persona.

---

## Phase 6 -- Adoption Timeline and Kill-Barrier Trajectory Verdict

**Part A disqualifier (required before grid):**

> "This Part A grid captures per-persona trajectory only. It does not satisfy the
> kill-barrier trajectory verdict requirement. That output belongs exclusively to Part B."

| Persona | T=0 | T=6mo | T=18mo | Trajectory | Driver of change |
|---------|-----|-------|--------|------------|-----------------|

At least one trajectory non-flat. T=6mo and T=18mo cannot copy T=0 without a stated reason.

**Part B: KILL-BARRIER TRAJECTORY VERDICT**

**Trajectory direction:** [Resolving / Stable / Worsening]

**Structural reasoning:** [Reference the structural persistence property from Phase 5(2)
by name. Argue from mechanism, not from the per-persona grid.]

**Relationship to Part A:** [Alignment or divergence -- which structural property drives both,
or why they differ.]

**Required trajectory label** (Citation Architecture row 4):

> **TRAJECTORY VERDICT: [exact direction word -- Resolving, Stable, or Worsening]**

Do not proceed to Phase 7 until written.

---

## Phase 7 -- Overall Adoption Inertia Risk

Verdict: Low / Medium / High / Critical.

- Score distribution (e.g., "2 High, 1 Critical")
- Kill-barrier trajectory: copy the exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label (Citation Architecture
  row 4). Do not write "Phase 6 Part B." Write the exact label.
- Competitive summary: kill barrier dimension + Phase 2 structural durability basis
- 1--2 sentence rationale tying score distribution, trajectory, and confirmed kill barrier

---

## Citation Chain Completeness Audit

**(Citation Architecture row 5 -- required before CCV)**

Produce the 5-column audit table using the Axis 2 column structure from AUDIT ARCHITECTURE
DECLARED above. For each link, write the actual downstream cite text in the Evidence column.
Assign Link type and Verdict from that evidence.

| Link | Source artifact | Consumer site | Evidence (write actual downstream cite text) | Link type | Verdict |
|------|----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| L1 | [exact Phase 1 artifact name] | Phase 4 methodology traces | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 4 trace that names the Phase 1 artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L2 | [exact Phase 2 artifact name] | Phase 5(2) structural persistence | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 5(2) that names the Phase 2 artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L3 | [exact LEVER POINT label] | AMEND(d) lever anchor | [write the exact text that WILL appear in AMEND(d)'s "Lever anchor:" field -- this is a forward commitment per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED; AMEND(d) copies from this cell only; Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited sources per Axis 3] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |
| L4 | [exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label] | Phase 7 trajectory cite | [write the exact phrase from your Phase 7 that names the Phase 6 Part B artifact] | [Reference-chain / Description-chain] | [PASS / CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] |

**Verdict rules:**
- Reference-chain: Evidence reproduces Source artifact label verbatim. Verdict: PASS.
- Description-chain: Evidence describes or paraphrases. Verdict: CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE --
  not "weaker," not "incomplete."
- L3 forward commitment: per Axis 3 of AUDIT ARCHITECTURE DECLARED, the text you write in
  the L3 Evidence cell is the source AMEND(d) copies from. Write the exact "Lever anchor:
  [LEVER POINT label]" text as it will appear. Phase 5(3) and CCV are prohibited.

**Required aggregate declaration on its own line:**

> "CHAIN COMPLETE: all four links are reference chains."

-- OR --

> "CHAIN BREAK: [list link IDs with CHAIN INTEGRITY FAILURE] -- return to Phase [X] and
> produce the required named artifact before re-auditing."

**Gate rule:** Do not proceed to CCV until CHAIN COMPLETE is written. If CHAIN BREAK, correct
and re-audit.

---

## Citation Chain Verification

Before writing AMEND, complete all six fields with named text.

1. **Phase 1 artifact name:** [exact text produced in Phase 1]
2. **Phase 2 artifact name:** [exact text produced in Phase 2]
3. **Phase 4 citation:** [exact artifact name from (1) as it appears in Phase 4 traces]
4. **Phase 5(2) citation:** [exact artifact name from (2) as it appears in Phase 5(2)]
5. **Phase 5(3) lever label:** [exact LEVER POINT label]
6. **Phase 6 Part B trajectory label:** [exact TRAJECTORY VERDICT label]

A field containing "Phase X" or "see above" without the actual artifact name fails.
Correct the upstream phase before proceeding.

---

## AMEND -- Focus, Quantify, Confirm

**Focus persona:** [name -- most exposed to confirmed kill barrier]

**Switching cost (sharpened):** [most precise quantified value]

**Kill barrier for this persona:** [one sentence -- competitive dimension, most acute because]

**Mitigation with full causal chain:**

> **(a) Intervention:** [one concrete action]
>
> **(b) Root cause addressed:** [name the structural condition from Phase 5(2)]
>
> **(c) Causal mechanism:** [why this lever reaches the structural condition in (2). Reference
> the Phase 5(3) lever point by name.]
>
> **(d) Confirmation signal at T=6mo:**
>
> Locate the L3 row of the Citation Chain Completeness Audit above. The Evidence column of

>

> behavioral or measurable condition]. Must be possible to observe it as absent.]

The lever anchor must reproduce the L3 Evidence cell text exactly. The AMEND section is not
complete without the lever anchor and the observable condition.

---
