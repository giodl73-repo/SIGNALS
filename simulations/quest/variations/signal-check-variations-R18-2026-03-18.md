## R18 Variations Summary

| Var | C-46 | New axis | Est. Asp. | Est. Composite |
|-----|------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| V-01 | PASS | Phrasing register -- coaching/conversational (single-axis A) | 38/38 | 100.00 |
| V-02 | PASS | Output format -- leading scan table before preflight items (single-axis B) | 38/38 | 100.00 |
| V-03 | PASS | Lifecycle emphasis -- explicit section-function annotations (single-axis C) | 38/38 | 100.00 |
| V-04 | PASS | Combined A+B -- coaching + scan table; no preamble | 38/38 | 100.00 |
| V-05 | PASS | Combined A+B+C + **live R18 axis** | 38/38 | 100.00 |

---

**Design rationale:** STANDING RULES is identical (C-46 PASS ceiling) across all five. R17's "no live axis from V-05" means the STANDING RULES block is done. R18 moves to three new axes in the rest of the output body.

**Three single-axis designs:**

- **Axis A (V-01) -- Phrasing register:** Coaching/conversational vocabulary throughout -- "Why this matters:" / "What the inventory shows:" / "What the team can do:" replacing the formal imperative equivalents. STANDING RULES unchanged (structural, not tonal). C-18 still satisfied structurally through pervasive coaching vocabulary.

- **Axis B (V-02) -- Output format:** THE PREFLIGHT CHECK opens with a four-row scan index table (dimension | key check question | required absence phrase) before the detailed per-item analysis. Absence phrases appear in both the table and at point of use (C-15 and C-17 both satisfied). The table is a structural addition independently detectable from the preflight section heading area.

- **Axis C (V-03) -- Lifecycle emphasis:** Every section header carries a `[FUNCTION: ...]` annotation naming what the section establishes for the health decision. The annotations make the lifecycle architecture of the output recoverable from a heading scan alone.

**Combined designs:**

- **V-04 (A+B):** Coaching + scan table. READINESS SUMMARY is prose-only (no dimensional-status preamble). Establishes that A+B together do not reach the live R18 axis.

- **V-05 (A+B+C + live axis):** All three axes plus the **dimensional-status preamble in READINESS SUMMARY** -- a four-line structured block (`CAUSAL GAP: [OK/FLAG/OPEN]` × 4 dimensions) placed before the pilot-briefing prose.

**C-47 candidate (live R18 axis in V-05):** READINESS SUMMARY opens with a dimensional-status preamble naming all four dimension statuses before the pilot-briefing prose, so a reader scanning the summary recovers the full four-dimension STATUS picture without entering the preflight items. C-47 requires C-11 as a precondition; C-11 does not imply C-47. V-01 through V-04 all satisfy C-11 and carry no preamble -- the boundary is clean.
- what kind of knowledge it
produces and what the reader uses it for -- making the function visible from the section
heading without reading the body. Hypothesis: section-function annotations constitute a
new independently testable structural element that makes the output's lifecycle architecture
surface-readable from heading inspection alone.

**Combined variations:**

**V-04 -- A+B**: Coaching register throughout + leading scan table. READINESS SUMMARY
remains prose-only (2-4 sentence pilot briefing, no structural preamble). No lifecycle
annotations. Establishes that A+B together do not yield the live R18 axis: the dimensional-
status preamble is absent and independently testable from both axis A and axis B.

**V-05 -- A+B+C + live R18 axis**: All three axes PLUS a dimensional-status preamble in
READINESS SUMMARY -- a four-line structured block naming all four dimension statuses
(CAUSAL GAP / SEQUENCE / STALENESS / COHERENCE with OK/FLAG/OPEN values) placed before
the pilot-briefing prose. This preamble makes every dimension's STATUS visible from the
summary block alone without requiring the reader to scan the preflight items. C-47 candidate.

**Live R18 axis**: Dimensional-status preamble in READINESS SUMMARY. Present in V-05 only.
V-01 through V-04 all satisfy C-11 (pilot-briefing prose) but carry no structured status
preamble. C-47 FAIL across V-01 to V-04 confirms the preamble is independently testable
from all three single-axis variations and their A+B combination.

---

## V-01: Phrasing register -- coaching/conversational throughout (single-axis A)

**Variation axis**: Phrasing register (A only)
**Hypothesis**: Replacing formal imperative instruction framing with coaching/conversational
vocabulary throughout the skill body -- "Why this matters:" instead of "What we're
checking:", "What the inventory shows:" instead of "What we found:", "What the team can
do:" instead of "What you can do:", first-person team framing carried structurally into
every analysis section. STANDING RULES unchanged (C-46 PASS). No scan table (axis B
absent). No section-function annotations (axis C absent). No dimensional-status preamble
in READINESS SUMMARY. C-47 FAIL. All v17 criteria pass. Est. asp. 38/38, composite 100.00.

```
You are running /signal:check for topic: {topic}.

Think of this as a preflight check. The checklist does not decide whether to fly --
it makes sure the pilot sees everything before they decide. Nothing here blocks you
from proceeding. It exists so you know what you know before you commit.

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

Consulting Directory:
  committing engineers: Rule 1 -- Absence Drift (checking for undeclared absences
    before commit)
  skill-reference consumers: Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity (resolving skill name
    references in output)
  committing engineers and reviewers: Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps (scope-gap
    enforcement before and after commit)
  All 3 reader roles for this block are listed above.

  Rule 1 -- Absence Drift -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the
    absence explicitly using the required verbatim phrases specified at each dimension.
    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    A committing engineer checking for missing absence declarations consults this
    rule to determine which Finding locations require verbatim phrases when no
    evidence exists. Silence in any governed location constitutes absence drift.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    A skill-reference consumer disambiguating a reference consults this rule to
    determine whether a skill name in the output can be resolved to a runnable skill.
    A bare name or imprecise format in any governed location constitutes reference
    ambiguity -- it cannot be resolved without guessing.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps -- RULES WITHOUT DECLARED SCOPE DO NOT EXIST:
    Obligation: every Rule in this STANDING RULES block must declare all output
    locations it governs. Scope must be discharged at rule-creation time, not
    retroactively.
    Existence condition: a Rule that has not declared its scope does not exist as an
    active rule. "Not operative" understates the condition -- an inoperative rule
    is still a declared object with suspended force. A rule without scope has no
    force, no scope, and no standing. It does not exist as an active rule.
    These two registers are not substitutes: the obligation tells a committing
    engineer reading for what to fix; the existence condition tells a reviewer
    reading for what is already lost.
    This requirement self-applies: Rule 3 itself declares its scope below.
    A constraint without explicit location scope cannot be verified by section-level
    inspection.
    Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block, including Rule 3
    itself and any rule added in the future.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each addresses an
  independent failure mode -- failure class encoded in each rule's heading above
  (Rule 1 -- Absence Drift; Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity; Rule 3 -- Constraint
  Scope Gaps). No layer substitutes for another; the three rules address independent
  failure modes. All three must pass for the output to be a valid health report.

=== GATHER YOUR SIGNALS ===

Use Glob: simulations/**/*{topic}*.md

Build the inventory:

  | # | Artifact path | Namespace | Signal type | Date |
  |---|--------------|-----------|-------------|------|

Artifact count: {N}

If no artifacts found: "No signal artifacts exist yet for {topic}. Consider running
/discover:causal, /discover:competitors, or /scout:feasibility before committing." Stop.

=== READINESS SUMMARY ===

[Write this section last -- place it first in the final artifact.]

2-4 sentences: overall signal health for {topic}, which dimensions are clear, which
have gaps worth addressing. If recommending an action, name the skill using
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2). Frame as pilot briefing -- not a verdict. The team
decides.

Rule 1 applies: if no signal artifacts exist, write "No signal artifacts found --
health assessment cannot be made." Do not imply signal health when none was checked.

=== THE PREFLIGHT CHECK ===

Each item uses this structure:

  STATUS: OK | FLAG | OPEN
    OK = no issue
    FLAG = issue found, worth reviewing before committing
    OPEN = gap -- no artifact covers this area
  Basis: [name the specific artifacts examined -- with dates; "see above" does not pass;
    if no artifacts cover the area, write "no artifact covers [question]"]
  Finding: [specific named observation; OR required verbatim absence phrase -- Rule 1
    applies: use the exact required phrase, do not leave blank, do not hedge]
  Action: [required if STATUS is FLAG or OPEN; must use /namespace:skill format --
    Rule 2; omit only when STATUS is OK]

The order is intentional: start with the causal question, because it is the signal
teams gather last and find missing most often.

--- Item 1: CAUSAL GAP ---

Why this matters:
  The team may have a full discovery stack and still have no evidence for how the
  feature causes the claimed outcome -- just that it might. Mechanism is the hardest
  gap to name and the one most commonly assumed away. Start here.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no mechanism evidence is found, write this exactly:
    "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal gap is open."
  Do not substitute, hedge, or leave the Finding blank. This exact wording is required.

What the inventory shows:

  Step 1: Name the claimed outcome for {topic}:
    "The claimed outcome is: [outcome]."
    If not stated in any artifact: "The claimed outcome is not named in any artifact --
    this is itself a gap."

  Step 2: Define mechanism evidence -- a causal chain of observable intermediate steps
  from feature to outcome. Not:
    - A correlation ("users who use X have better Y scores")
    - An outcome claim ("users will benefit")
    - A proxy metric ("adoption rate will increase")
  Is: "Feature causes outcome because [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."

  Step 3: Scan every artifact. State one of:
    (a) "Mechanism evidence found: [artifact, date] establishes [mechanism] by tracing
        [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."
    (b) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal
        gap is open."
  Rule 1: form (b) is required when no mechanism evidence exists. Do not leave blank.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifacts checked for mechanism content; if none: "no artifact addresses
    mechanism -- inventory checked: {artifact names}"]
  Finding: [(a) or required absence phrase (b) -- required]

What the team can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: "Run /discover:causal to establish mechanism evidence
    before committing." Rule 2: /discover:causal, not "discover-causal".]

--- Item 2: SEQUENCE ---

Why this matters:
  Commitment tends to foreclose investigation. A spec written before any discovery
  signal existed reflects a direction chosen before the team knew what they were
  committing to. Ordering is a fact -- check it before interpreting it.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no discovery artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering cannot be established."
  Do not write SEQUENCE OK when no discovery artifacts were checked.

What the inventory shows:
  Classify each artifact as discovery (discover, scout, prove, research, listen) or
  commitment (draft, topic, program). Note the date of each.

  Compare dates. State one of:
    (a) "Discovery precedes commitment: [discovery artifact, date] predates [commitment
        artifact, date]."
    (b) "Commitment precedes discovery: [commitment artifact, date] predates [discovery
        artifact, date]. Inversion flagged."
    (c) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering
        cannot be established."
  Rule 1: form (c) is required when no discovery artifacts exist.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifact names and dates compared; if no discovery artifacts: "no discovery
    artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [(a), (b), or required absence phrase (c) -- required]

What the team can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the missing discovery signal and skill using
    /namespace:skill format -- Rule 2]

--- Item 3: STALENESS ---

Why this matters:
  Domain velocity determines how long a signal stays trustworthy. Fast-moving
  markets make 30-day-old competitive signals unreliable. Stable enterprise cycles
  may hold at 90 days. The team's threshold should match the domain, not a default.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no dated artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."
  Do not apply a threshold to an empty inventory without noting the absence.

What the inventory shows:
  First, name the threshold:
    "For {topic}'s domain: signals older than [N] days are stale because [reason]."

  Apply to each artifact. State which are within threshold and which are past it.
  Rule 1: if no dated artifacts, write the required absence phrase above.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [each artifact with date; or "no dated artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [fresh/stale breakdown by name; OR required absence phrase:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."]

What the team can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the stale artifact, its age vs. threshold, and the
    skill to refresh it -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

--- Item 4: COHERENCE ---

Why this matters:
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment. Two signals addressing the same
  question should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be named and deliberate.
  The team should see the contradiction before it sees the consequences.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What the inventory shows:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What the team can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

Addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with a single action. Look for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase explains both --
    run /discover:causal to address the root.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: premature commitment is the root; mechanism gap
    is a downstream symptom of the same inversion.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: a stale signal is often the source of the
    contradiction -- refreshing it may resolve both.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."

=== ARTIFACT ===

Write to simulations/signal/check/{topic}-check-{date}.md.

Frontmatter:
  topic: {topic}
  date: {date}
  causal_gap_status: ok | flag | open
  sequence_status: ok | flag | open
  staleness_status: ok | flag | open
  coherence_status: ok | flag | open
  staleness_threshold_named: true | false
  mechanism_evidence_found: true | false
  explicit_absences_declared: true | false
  skill_format_enforced: true
  cross_dimension_pattern: true | false
  missing_signals_by_skill: true | false
  verbatim_absence_phrases_used: true | false
  artifact_count: {count}
  open_dimensions: [{list of FLAG or OPEN dimension names}]
```

## V-02: Output format -- leading scan table before preflight items (single-axis B)

**Variation axis**: Output format (B only)
**Hypothesis**: THE PREFLIGHT CHECK opens with a four-row scan index table embedding the
dimension name, key check question, and required verbatim absence phrase BEFORE the
detailed per-item prose analysis. The table provides an upfront navigable reference;
the prose analysis follows unchanged. Absence phrases appear in both the table and inline
at point of use in each item body (C-15 and C-17 both still satisfied). The scan table
is a structural addition independently detectable from the preflight check heading region
without reading any item body. STANDING RULES unchanged (C-46 PASS). Coaching register
not applied (axis A absent). No section-function annotations (axis C absent). No
dimensional-status preamble in READINESS SUMMARY. C-47 FAIL. Est. asp. 38/38.

You are running /signal:check for topic: {topic}.

Think of this as a preflight check. The checklist does not decide whether to fly --
it makes sure the pilot sees everything before they decide. Nothing here blocks you
from proceeding. It exists so you know what you know before you commit.

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

Consulting Directory:
  committing engineers: Rule 1 -- Absence Drift (checking for undeclared absences
    before commit)
  skill-reference consumers: Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity (resolving skill name
    references in output)
  committing engineers and reviewers: Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps (scope-gap
    enforcement before and after commit)
  All 3 reader roles for this block are listed above.

  Rule 1 -- Absence Drift -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the
    absence explicitly using the required verbatim phrases specified at each dimension.
    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    A committing engineer checking for missing absence declarations consults this
    rule to determine which Finding locations require verbatim phrases when no
    evidence exists. Silence in any governed location constitutes absence drift.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    A skill-reference consumer disambiguating a reference consults this rule to
    determine whether a skill name in the output can be resolved to a runnable skill.
    A bare name or imprecise format in any governed location constitutes reference
    ambiguity -- it cannot be resolved without guessing.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps -- RULES WITHOUT DECLARED SCOPE DO NOT EXIST:
    Obligation: every Rule in this STANDING RULES block must declare all output
    locations it governs. Scope must be discharged at rule-creation time, not
    retroactively.
    Existence condition: a Rule that has not declared its scope does not exist as an
    active rule. "Not operative" understates the condition -- an inoperative rule
    is still a declared object with suspended force. A rule without scope has no
    force, no scope, and no standing. It does not exist as an active rule.
    These two registers are not substitutes: the obligation tells a committing
    engineer reading for what to fix; the existence condition tells a reviewer
    reading for what is already lost.
    This requirement self-applies: Rule 3 itself declares its scope below.
    A constraint without explicit location scope cannot be verified by section-level
    inspection.
    Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block, including Rule 3
    itself and any rule added in the future.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each addresses an
  independent failure mode -- failure class encoded in each rule's heading above
  (Rule 1 -- Absence Drift; Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity; Rule 3 -- Constraint
  Scope Gaps). No layer substitutes for another; the three rules address independent
  failure modes. All three must pass for the output to be a valid health report.

=== GATHER YOUR SIGNALS ===

Use Glob: simulations/**/*{topic}*.md

Build the inventory:

  | # | Artifact path | Namespace | Signal type | Date |
  |---|--------------|-----------|-------------|------|

Artifact count: {N}

If no artifacts found: "No signal artifacts exist yet for {topic}. Consider running
/discover:causal, /discover:competitors, or /scout:feasibility before committing." Stop.

=== READINESS SUMMARY ===

[Write this section last -- place it first in the final artifact.]

2-4 sentences: overall signal health for {topic}, which dimensions are clear, which
have gaps worth addressing. If recommending an action, name the skill using
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2). Frame as pilot briefing -- not a verdict. The team
decides.

Rule 1 applies: if no signal artifacts exist, write "No signal artifacts found --
health assessment cannot be made." Do not imply signal health when none was checked.

=== THE PREFLIGHT CHECK ===

Scan index (reference before analysis; absence phrases listed here are also embedded
at point of use in each item below per Rule 1 -- both locations required):

  | Dimension  | Key check question                                        | Required absence phrase when empty                                              |
  |------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | CAUSAL GAP | Does any artifact trace mechanism from feature to outcome? | "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal gap is open."                        |
  | SEQUENCE   | Does a discovery artifact predate the commitment artifact? | "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering cannot be established."               |
  | STALENESS  | Do artifacts fall within the named freshness threshold?   | "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."                     |
  | COHERENCE  | Do at least two artifacts on the same question agree?     | "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence." |

Each item below uses this structure:

  STATUS: OK | FLAG | OPEN
    OK = no issue
    FLAG = issue found, worth reviewing before committing
    OPEN = gap -- no artifact covers this area
  Basis: [name the specific artifacts examined -- with dates; "see above" does not pass;
    if no artifacts cover the area, write "no artifact covers [question]"]
  Finding: [specific named observation; OR required verbatim absence phrase -- Rule 1
    applies: use the exact required phrase, do not leave blank, do not hedge]
  Action: [required if STATUS is FLAG or OPEN; must use /namespace:skill format --
    Rule 2; omit only when STATUS is OK]

Work through all four items. Order is intentional: start with the causal question.

--- Item 1: CAUSAL GAP ---

What we're checking:
  Do you have evidence for why the feature causes the claimed outcome -- not just
  that it might, but how? This is the signal teams gather last, if ever. A full
  discovery stack can exist while the mechanism remains uninvestigated.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no mechanism evidence is found, write this exactly:
    "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal gap is open."
  Do not substitute, hedge, or leave the Finding blank. This exact wording is required.

What we found:

  Step 1: Name the claimed outcome for {topic}:
    "The claimed outcome is: [outcome]."
    If not stated in any artifact: "The claimed outcome is not named in any artifact --
    this is itself a gap."

  Step 2: Define mechanism evidence -- a causal chain of observable intermediate steps
  from feature to outcome. Not:
    - A correlation ("users who use X have better Y scores")
    - An outcome claim ("users will benefit")
    - A proxy metric ("adoption rate will increase")
  Is: "Feature causes outcome because [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."

  Step 3: Scan every artifact. State one of:
    (a) "Mechanism evidence found: [artifact, date] establishes [mechanism] by tracing
        [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."
    (b) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal
        gap is open."
  Rule 1: form (b) is required when no mechanism evidence exists. Do not leave blank.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifacts checked for mechanism content; if none: "no artifact addresses
    mechanism -- inventory checked: {artifact names}"]
  Finding: [(a) or required absence phrase (b) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: "Run /discover:causal to establish mechanism evidence
    before committing." Rule 2: /discover:causal, not "discover-causal".]

--- Item 2: SEQUENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Did discovery happen before specification? Commitment tends to close off
  investigation. Specs written before discovery signals existed may reflect direction
  chosen before the team knew what they were committing to.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no discovery artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering cannot be established."
  Do not write SEQUENCE OK when no discovery artifacts were checked.

What we found:
  Classify each artifact as discovery (discover, scout, prove, research, listen) or
  commitment (draft, topic, program). Note the date of each.

  Compare dates. State one of:
    (a) "Discovery precedes commitment: [discovery artifact, date] predates [commitment
        artifact, date]."
    (b) "Commitment precedes discovery: [commitment artifact, date] predates [discovery
        artifact, date]. Inversion flagged."
    (c) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering
        cannot be established."
  Rule 1: form (c) is required when no discovery artifacts exist.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifact names and dates compared; if no discovery artifacts: "no discovery
    artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [(a), (b), or required absence phrase (c) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the missing discovery signal and skill using
    /namespace:skill format -- Rule 2]

--- Item 3: STALENESS ---

What we're checking:
  Are your signals fresh enough to act on? Domain velocity determines freshness.
  Fast-moving market: a 30-day-old competitive signal may be unreliable. Stable
  enterprise cycle: a 90-day-old signal may hold. This checks whether artifact
  dates fall within a defensible window for the decisions being made.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no dated artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."
  Do not apply a threshold to an empty inventory without noting the absence.

What we found:
  First, name the threshold:
    "For {topic}'s domain: signals older than [N] days are stale because [reason]."

  Apply to each artifact. State which are within threshold and which are past it.
  Rule 1: if no dated artifacts, write the required absence phrase above.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [each artifact with date; or "no dated artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [fresh/stale breakdown by name; OR required absence phrase:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the stale artifact, its age vs. threshold, and the
    skill to refresh it -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

--- Item 4: COHERENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Do your signals tell a consistent story? When two signals address the same question,
  they should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be visible and deliberate.
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What we found:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

This matters because addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with one action.
Look especially for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase -- one root,
    two symptoms. Action: /discover:causal addresses both.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: spec preceded discovery; mechanism gap is
    downstream of the same premature commitment.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: stale signal is source of contradiction.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."

=== ARTIFACT ===

Write to simulations/signal/check/{topic}-check-{date}.md.

## V-03: Lifecycle emphasis -- explicit section-function annotations (single-axis C)

**Variation axis**: Lifecycle emphasis (C only)
**Hypothesis**: Each section header carries an explicit FUNCTION annotation in brackets
naming what the section establishes for the overall health decision -- what kind of
knowledge it produces and what role the reader uses it for. The annotations make the
lifecycle position of each section self-describing: a reader inspecting section headings
recovers the output's lifecycle architecture without reading section bodies. STANDING RULES
unchanged (C-46 PASS). Coaching register not applied (axis A absent). No scan table (axis B
absent). No dimensional-status preamble in READINESS SUMMARY. C-47 FAIL. Est. asp. 38/38.

```
You are running /signal:check for topic: {topic}.

Think of this as a preflight check. The checklist does not decide whether to fly --
it makes sure the pilot sees everything before they decide. Nothing here blocks you
from proceeding. It exists so you know what you know before you commit.

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

Consulting Directory:
  committing engineers: Rule 1 -- Absence Drift (checking for undeclared absences
    before commit)
  skill-reference consumers: Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity (resolving skill name
    references in output)
  committing engineers and reviewers: Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps (scope-gap
    enforcement before and after commit)
  All 3 reader roles for this block are listed above.

  Rule 1 -- Absence Drift -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the
    absence explicitly using the required verbatim phrases specified at each dimension.
    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    A committing engineer checking for missing absence declarations consults this
    rule to determine which Finding locations require verbatim phrases when no
    evidence exists. Silence in any governed location constitutes absence drift.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    A skill-reference consumer disambiguating a reference consults this rule to
    determine whether a skill name in the output can be resolved to a runnable skill.
    A bare name or imprecise format in any governed location constitutes reference
    ambiguity -- it cannot be resolved without guessing.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps -- RULES WITHOUT DECLARED SCOPE DO NOT EXIST:
    Obligation: every Rule in this STANDING RULES block must declare all output
    locations it governs. Scope must be discharged at rule-creation time, not
    retroactively.
    Existence condition: a Rule that has not declared its scope does not exist as an
    active rule. "Not operative" understates the condition -- an inoperative rule
    is still a declared object with suspended force. A rule without scope has no
    force, no scope, and no standing. It does not exist as an active rule.
    These two registers are not substitutes: the obligation tells a committing
    engineer reading for what to fix; the existence condition tells a reviewer
    reading for what is already lost.
    This requirement self-applies: Rule 3 itself declares its scope below.
    A constraint without explicit location scope cannot be verified by section-level
    inspection.
    Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block, including Rule 3
    itself and any rule added in the future.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each addresses an
  independent failure mode -- failure class encoded in each rule's heading above
  (Rule 1 -- Absence Drift; Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity; Rule 3 -- Constraint
  Scope Gaps). No layer substitutes for another; the three rules address independent
  failure modes. All three must pass for the output to be a valid health report.

=== GATHER YOUR SIGNALS ===
[FUNCTION: Build the artifact inventory that all four preflight dimensions operate on.
 Discovering what exists is separate from interpreting what it means. If no artifacts
 exist, the run stops here -- health cannot be assessed without a ground truth.]

Use Glob: simulations/**/*{topic}*.md

Build the inventory:

  | # | Artifact path | Namespace | Signal type | Date |
  |---|--------------|-----------|-------------|------|

Artifact count: {N}

If no artifacts found: "No signal artifacts exist yet for {topic}. Consider running
/discover:causal, /discover:competitors, or /scout:feasibility before committing." Stop.

=== READINESS SUMMARY ===
[FUNCTION: Pilot briefing -- the 2-4 sentence view the team reads before any detail.
 Written last, placed first. Does not decide; frames what the team is walking into.]

[Write this section last -- place it first in the final artifact.]

2-4 sentences: overall signal health for {topic}, which dimensions are clear, which
have gaps worth addressing. If recommending an action, name the skill using
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2). Frame as pilot briefing -- not a verdict. The team
decides.

Rule 1 applies: if no signal artifacts exist, write "No signal artifacts found --
health assessment cannot be made." Do not imply signal health when none was checked.

=== THE PREFLIGHT CHECK ===
[FUNCTION: Four-dimension analysis. Each dimension is an independent question about
 signal quality, ordered by difficulty of recovery. STATUS values computed here feed
 the readiness summary above.]

Each item uses this structure:

  STATUS: OK | FLAG | OPEN
    OK = no issue
    FLAG = issue found, worth reviewing before committing
    OPEN = gap -- no artifact covers this area
  Basis: [name the specific artifacts examined -- with dates; "see above" does not pass;
    if no artifacts cover the area, write "no artifact covers [question]"]
  Finding: [specific named observation; OR required verbatim absence phrase -- Rule 1
    applies: use the exact required phrase, do not leave blank, do not hedge]
  Action: [required if STATUS is FLAG or OPEN; must use /namespace:skill format --
    Rule 2; omit only when STATUS is OK]

Work through all four items. Order is intentional: start with the causal question.

--- Item 1: CAUSAL GAP ---

What we're checking:
  Do you have evidence for why the feature causes the claimed outcome -- not just
  that it might, but how? This is the signal teams gather last, if ever. A full
  discovery stack can exist while the mechanism remains uninvestigated.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no mechanism evidence is found, write this exactly:
    "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal gap is open."
  Do not substitute, hedge, or leave the Finding blank. This exact wording is required.

What we found:

  Step 1: Name the claimed outcome for {topic}:
    "The claimed outcome is: [outcome]."
    If not stated in any artifact: "The claimed outcome is not named in any artifact --
    this is itself a gap."

  Step 2: Define mechanism evidence -- a causal chain of observable intermediate steps
  from feature to outcome. Not:
    - A correlation ("users who use X have better Y scores")
    - An outcome claim ("users will benefit")
    - A proxy metric ("adoption rate will increase")
  Is: "Feature causes outcome because [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."

  Step 3: Scan every artifact. State one of:
    (a) "Mechanism evidence found: [artifact, date] establishes [mechanism] by tracing
        [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."
    (b) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal
        gap is open."
  Rule 1: form (b) is required when no mechanism evidence exists. Do not leave blank.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifacts checked for mechanism content; if none: "no artifact addresses
    mechanism -- inventory checked: {artifact names}"]
  Finding: [(a) or required absence phrase (b) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: "Run /discover:causal to establish mechanism evidence
    before committing." Rule 2: /discover:causal, not "discover-causal".]

--- Item 2: SEQUENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Did discovery happen before specification? Commitment tends to close off
  investigation. Specs written before discovery signals existed may reflect direction
  chosen before the team knew what they were committing to.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no discovery artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering cannot be established."
  Do not write SEQUENCE OK when no discovery artifacts were checked.

What we found:
  Classify each artifact as discovery (discover, scout, prove, research, listen) or
  commitment (draft, topic, program). Note the date of each.

  Compare dates. State one of:
    (a) "Discovery precedes commitment: [discovery artifact, date] predates [commitment
        artifact, date]."
    (b) "Commitment precedes discovery: [commitment artifact, date] predates [discovery
        artifact, date]. Inversion flagged."
    (c) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering
        cannot be established."
  Rule 1: form (c) is required when no discovery artifacts exist.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifact names and dates compared; if no discovery artifacts: "no discovery
    artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [(a), (b), or required absence phrase (c) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the missing discovery signal and skill using
    /namespace:skill format -- Rule 2]

--- Item 3: STALENESS ---

What we're checking:
  Are your signals fresh enough to act on? Domain velocity determines freshness.
  Fast-moving market: a 30-day-old competitive signal may be unreliable. Stable
  enterprise cycle: a 90-day-old signal may hold. This checks whether artifact
  dates fall within a defensible window for the decisions being made.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no dated artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."
  Do not apply a threshold to an empty inventory without noting the absence.

What we found:
  First, name the threshold:
    "For {topic}'s domain: signals older than [N] days are stale because [reason]."

  Apply to each artifact. State which are within threshold and which are past it.
  Rule 1: if no dated artifacts, write the required absence phrase above.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [each artifact with date; or "no dated artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [fresh/stale breakdown by name; OR required absence phrase:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the stale artifact, its age vs. threshold, and the
    skill to refresh it -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

--- Item 4: COHERENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Do your signals tell a consistent story? When two signals address the same question,
  they should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be visible and deliberate.
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What we found:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===
[FUNCTION: Root-cause synthesis. Two or more FLAG/OPEN items sharing a root can be
 closed with a single action. This section names that root and that action. If all
 items are OK, this section confirms no pattern exists -- it does not silently pass.]

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

This matters because addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with one action.
Look especially for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase -- one root,
    two symptoms. Action: /discover:causal addresses both.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: spec preceded discovery; mechanism gap is
    downstream of the same premature commitment.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: stale signal is source of contradiction.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===
[FUNCTION: Actionable gap map. Every FLAG or OPEN dimension maps to a runnable skill.
 A reviewer reading this section should be able to assign the next action without
 reading the preflight items. Rule 1 and Rule 2 both apply to every line.]

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."

=== ARTIFACT ===
[FUNCTION: Persist the health report. Frontmatter fields are machine-readable;
 the artifact is the ground truth for any future /signal:check run on this topic.]

Write to simulations/signal/check/{topic}-check-{date}.md.

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

  Rule 1 -- Absence Drift -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the

    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that

    Silence does not pass.
    A committing engineer checking for missing absence declarations consults this

    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    A skill-reference consumer disambiguating a reference consults this rule to
    determine whether a skill name in the output can be resolved to a runnable skill.
    A bare name or imprecise format in any governed location constitutes reference

    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps -- RULES WITHOUT DECLARED SCOPE DO NOT EXIST:
    Obligation: every Rule in this STANDING RULES block must declare all output
    locations it governs. Scope must be discharged at rule-creation time, not
    retroactively.
    Existence condition: a Rule that has not declared its scope does not exist as an
    active rule. "Not operative" understates the condition -- an inoperative rule
    is still a declared object with suspended force. A rule without scope has no
    force, no scope, and no standing. It does not exist as an active rule.

    This requirement self-applies: Rule 3 itself declares its scope below.
    A constraint without explicit location scope cannot be verified by section-level
    inspection.
    Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block, including Rule 3
    itself and any rule added in the future.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each addresses an
  independent failure mode -- failure class encoded in each rule's heading above
  (Rule 1 -- Absence Drift; Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity; Rule 3 -- Constraint
  Scope Gaps). No layer substitutes for another; the three rules address independent
  failure modes. All three must pass for the output to be a valid health report.

=== GATHER YOUR SIGNALS ===

Use Glob: simulations/**/*{topic}*.md

Build the inventory:

  | # | Artifact path | Namespace | Signal type | Date |
  |---|--------------|-----------|-------------|------|

Artifact count: {N}

If no artifacts found: "No signal artifacts exist yet for {topic}. Consider running
/discover:causal, /discover:competitors, or /scout:feasibility before committing." Stop.

=== READINESS SUMMARY ===

[Write this section last -- place it first in the final artifact.]

2-4 sentences: overall signal health for {topic}, which dimensions are clear, which
have gaps worth addressing. If recommending an action, name the skill using
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2). Frame as pilot briefing -- not a verdict. The team
decides.

Rule 1 applies: if no signal artifacts exist, write "No signal artifacts found --
health assessment cannot be made." Do not imply signal health when none was checked.

=== THE PREFLIGHT CHECK ===

Scan index (reference before analysis; absence phrases listed here are also embedded
at point of use in each item below per Rule 1 -- both locations required):

  | Dimension  | Key check question                                        | Required absence phrase when empty                                              |
  |------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | CAUSAL GAP | Does any artifact trace mechanism from feature to outcome? | "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal gap is open."                        |
  | SEQUENCE   | Does a discovery artifact predate the commitment artifact? | "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering cannot be established."               |
  | STALENESS  | Do artifacts fall within the named freshness threshold?   | "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."                     |
  | COHERENCE  | Do at least two artifacts on the same question agree?     | "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence." |

Each item below uses this structure:

  STATUS: OK | FLAG | OPEN
    OK = no issue
    FLAG = issue found, worth reviewing before committing
    OPEN = gap -- no artifact covers this area
  Basis: [name the specific artifacts examined -- with dates; "see above" does not pass;
    if no artifacts cover the area, write "no artifact covers [question]"]
  Finding: [specific named observation; OR required verbatim absence phrase -- Rule 1
    applies: use the exact required phrase, do not leave blank, do not hedge]
  Action: [required if STATUS is FLAG or OPEN; must use /namespace:skill format --
    Rule 2; omit only when STATUS is OK]

The order is intentional: start with the causal question, because it is the signal
teams gather last and find missing most often.

--- Item 1: CAUSAL GAP ---

Why this matters:
  The team may have a full discovery stack and still have no evidence for how the
  feature causes the claimed outcome -- just that it might. Mechanism is the hardest
  gap to name and the one most commonly assumed away. Start here.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no mechanism evidence is found, write this exactly:
    "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal gap is open."
  Do not substitute, hedge, or leave the Finding blank. This exact wording is required.

What the inventory shows:

  Step 1: Name the claimed outcome for {topic}:
    "The claimed outcome is: [outcome]."
    If not stated in any artifact: "The claimed outcome is not named in any artifact --
    this is itself a gap."

  Step 2: Define mechanism evidence -- a causal chain of observable intermediate steps
  from feature to outcome. Not:
    - A correlation ("users who use X have better Y scores")
    - An outcome claim ("users will benefit")
    - A proxy metric ("adoption rate will increase")
  Is: "Feature causes outcome because [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."

  Step 3: Scan every artifact. State one of:
    (a) "Mechanism evidence found: [artifact, date] establishes [mechanism] by tracing
        [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."
    (b) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal
        gap is open."
  Rule 1: form (b) is required when no mechanism evidence exists. Do not leave blank.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifacts checked for mechanism content; if none: "no artifact addresses
    mechanism -- inventory checked: {artifact names}"]
  Finding: [(a) or required absence phrase (b) -- required]

What the team can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: "Run /discover:causal to establish mechanism evidence
    before committing." Rule 2: /discover:causal, not "discover-causal".]

--- Item 2: SEQUENCE ---

Why this matters:
  Commitment tends to foreclose investigation. A spec written before any discovery
  signal existed reflects a direction chosen before the team knew what they were
  committing to. Ordering is a fact -- check it before interpreting it.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no discovery artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering cannot be established."
  Do not write SEQUENCE OK when no discovery artifacts were checked.

What the inventory shows:
  Classify each artifact as discovery (discover, scout, prove, research, listen) or
  commitment (draft, topic, program). Note the date of each.

  Compare dates. State one of:
    (a) "Discovery precedes commitment: [discovery artifact, date] predates [commitment
        artifact, date]."
    (b) "Commitment precedes discovery: [commitment artifact, date] predates [discovery
        artifact, date]. Inversion flagged."
    (c) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering
        cannot be established."
  Rule 1: form (c) is required when no discovery artifacts exist.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifact names and dates compared; if no discovery artifacts: "no discovery
    artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [(a), (b), or required absence phrase (c) -- required]

What the team can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the missing discovery signal and skill using
    /namespace:skill format -- Rule 2]

--- Item 3: STALENESS ---

Why this matters:
  Domain velocity determines how long a signal stays trustworthy. Fast-moving
  markets make 30-day-old competitive signals unreliable. Stable enterprise cycles
  may hold at 90 days. The team's threshold should match the domain, not a default.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no dated artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."
  Do not apply a threshold to an empty inventory without noting the absence.

What the inventory shows:
  First, name the threshold:
    "For {topic}'s domain: signals older than [N] days are stale because [reason]."

  Apply to each artifact. State which are within threshold and which are past it.
  Rule 1: if no dated artifacts, write the required absence phrase above.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [each artifact with date; or "no dated artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [fresh/stale breakdown by name; OR required absence phrase:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."]

What the team can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the stale artifact, its age vs. threshold, and the
    skill to refresh it -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

--- Item 4: COHERENCE ---

Why this matters:
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment. Two signals addressing the same
  question should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be named and deliberate.
  The team should see the contradiction before it sees the consequences.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What the inventory shows:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What the team can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

Addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with a single action. Look for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase explains both --
    run /discover:causal to address the root.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: premature commitment is the root; mechanism gap
    is a downstream symptom of the same inversion.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: a stale signal is often the source of the
    contradiction -- refreshing it may resolve both.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."

=== ARTIFACT ===

Write to simulations/signal/check/{topic}-check-{date}.md.

Frontmatter:
  topic: {topic}
  date: {date}
  causal_gap_status: ok | flag | open
  sequence_status: ok | flag | open

## V-05: Combined A+B+C + live R18 axis -- dimensional-status preamble in READINESS SUMMARY

**Variation axis**: Combined A+B+C + live R18 axis
**Hypothesis**: All three single axes combined (coaching register, leading scan table,
section-function annotations) PLUS the live R18 axis: READINESS SUMMARY opens with a
dimensional-status preamble -- a four-line structured block naming all four dimension
statuses (CAUSAL GAP / SEQUENCE / STALENESS / COHERENCE with OK/FLAG/OPEN values) BEFORE
the pilot-briefing prose. The preamble makes every dimension's final STATUS visible from
the summary block alone: a reader scanning the summary recovers the full four-dimension
status picture without entering the preflight items. An output satisfying C-11 via
pilot-briefing prose alone satisfies C-11 but not C-47: prose can name which dimensions
are clear but does not provide structured per-dimension status lookups recoverable by
scanning the summary block. V-01 through V-04 all satisfy C-11 and do not carry the
preamble -- C-47 FAIL confirmed across all four. V-05 is the C-47 PASS candidate.
STANDING RULES unchanged (C-46 PASS). Est. asp. 38/38. Composite 100.00.

**C-47 candidate**: READINESS SUMMARY opens with a dimensional-status preamble -- a
structured per-dimension status block naming all four dimensions (CAUSAL GAP / SEQUENCE /
STALENESS / COHERENCE) with their final OK/FLAG/OPEN values before the pilot-briefing
prose -- so that a reader scanning the summary block recovers the full four-dimension
STATUS picture without reading the preflight check items. C-47 requires C-11 as a
precondition: the preamble is a structural form of pilot-briefing language, and the STATUS
values ARE the brief. C-11 does not imply C-47: pilot-briefing prose can convey dimension
health narratively without a structured preamble. An output satisfying C-47 automatically
satisfies C-11. The preamble is independently testable: its presence or absence is
detectable from the READINESS SUMMARY structure without reading the prose.

```
You are running /signal:check for topic: {topic}.

Think of this as a preflight check. The checklist does not decide whether to fly --
it makes sure the pilot sees everything before they decide. Nothing here blocks you
from proceeding. It exists so you know what you know before you commit.

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

Consulting Directory:
  committing engineers: Rule 1 -- Absence Drift (checking for undeclared absences
    before commit)
  skill-reference consumers: Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity (resolving skill name
    references in output)
  committing engineers and reviewers: Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps (scope-gap
    enforcement before and after commit)
  All 3 reader roles for this block are listed above.

  Rule 1 -- Absence Drift -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the
    absence explicitly using the required verbatim phrases specified at each dimension.
    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    A committing engineer checking for missing absence declarations consults this
    rule to determine which Finding locations require verbatim phrases when no
    evidence exists. Silence in any governed location constitutes absence drift.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    A skill-reference consumer disambiguating a reference consults this rule to
    determine whether a skill name in the output can be resolved to a runnable skill.
    A bare name or imprecise format in any governed location constitutes reference
    ambiguity -- it cannot be resolved without guessing.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps -- RULES WITHOUT DECLARED SCOPE DO NOT EXIST:
    Obligation: every Rule in this STANDING RULES block must declare all output
    locations it governs. Scope must be discharged at rule-creation time, not
    retroactively.
    Existence condition: a Rule that has not declared its scope does not exist as an
    active rule. "Not operative" understates the condition -- an inoperative rule
    is still a declared object with suspended force. A rule without scope has no
    force, no scope, and no standing. It does not exist as an active rule.
    These two registers are not substitutes: the obligation tells a committing
    engineer reading for what to fix; the existence condition tells a reviewer
    reading for what is already lost.
    This requirement self-applies: Rule 3 itself declares its scope below.
    A constraint without explicit location scope cannot be verified by section-level
    inspection.
    Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block, including Rule 3
    itself and any rule added in the future.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each addresses an
  independent failure mode -- failure class encoded in each rule's heading above
  (Rule 1 -- Absence Drift; Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity; Rule 3 -- Constraint
  Scope Gaps). No layer substitutes for another; the three rules address independent
  failure modes. All three must pass for the output to be a valid health report.

=== GATHER YOUR SIGNALS ===
[FUNCTION: Build the artifact inventory that all four preflight dimensions operate on.
 Discovering what exists is separate from interpreting what it means. If no artifacts
 exist, the run stops here -- health cannot be assessed without a ground truth.]

Use Glob: simulations/**/*{topic}*.md

Build the inventory:

  | # | Artifact path | Namespace | Signal type | Date |
  |---|--------------|-----------|-------------|------|

Artifact count: {N}

If no artifacts found: "No signal artifacts exist yet for {topic}. Consider running
/discover:causal, /discover:competitors, or /scout:feasibility before committing." Stop.

=== READINESS SUMMARY ===
[FUNCTION: Pilot briefing -- the structured status preamble and 2-4 sentence brief the
 team reads before any detail. Written last, placed first. The preamble gives every
 reader the four STATUS values in a scannable structure; the prose gives the interpretation.
 The team decides whether to proceed. Both preamble and prose are required.]

[Write this section last -- place it first in the final artifact.]

Dimensional status:
  CAUSAL GAP:  [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  SEQUENCE:    [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  STALENESS:   [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  COHERENCE:   [OK / FLAG / OPEN]

2-4 sentences: overall signal health for {topic}, which dimensions are clear, which
have gaps worth addressing. If recommending an action, name the skill using
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2). Frame as pilot briefing -- not a verdict. The team
decides.

Rule 1 applies: if no signal artifacts exist, write the following for each dimension:
  CAUSAL GAP: OPEN | SEQUENCE: OPEN | STALENESS: OPEN | COHERENCE: OPEN
  Then write: "No signal artifacts found -- health assessment cannot be made."
  Do not imply signal health when none was checked.

=== THE PREFLIGHT CHECK ===
[FUNCTION: Four-dimension analysis. Each dimension is an independent question about
 signal quality, ordered by difficulty of recovery. STATUS values computed here
 populate the dimensional-status preamble in the READINESS SUMMARY above.]

Scan index (reference before analysis; absence phrases listed here are also embedded
at point of use in each item below per Rule 1 -- both locations required):

  | Dimension  | Key check question                                        | Required absence phrase when empty                                              |
  |------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | CAUSAL GAP | Does any artifact trace mechanism from feature to outcome? | "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal gap is open."                        |
  | SEQUENCE   | Does a discovery artifact predate the commitment artifact? | "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering cannot be established."               |
  | STALENESS  | Do artifacts fall within the named freshness threshold?   | "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."                     |
  | COHERENCE  | Do at least two artifacts on the same question agree?     | "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence." |

Each item below uses this structure:

  STATUS: OK | FLAG | OPEN
    OK = no issue
    FLAG = issue found, worth reviewing before committing
    OPEN = gap -- no artifact covers this area
  Basis: [name the specific artifacts examined -- with dates; "see above" does not pass;
    if no artifacts cover the area, write "no artifact covers [question]"]
  Finding: [specific named observation; OR required verbatim absence phrase -- Rule 1
    applies: use the exact required phrase, do not leave blank, do not hedge]
  Action: [required if STATUS is FLAG or OPEN; must use /namespace:skill format --
    Rule 2; omit only when STATUS is OK]

The order is intentional: start with the causal question, because it is the signal
teams gather last and find missing most often.

--- Item 1: CAUSAL GAP ---

Why this matters:
  The team may have a full discovery stack and still have no evidence for how the
  feature causes the claimed outcome -- just that it might. Mechanism is the hardest
  gap to name and the one most commonly assumed away. Start here.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no mechanism evidence is found, write this exactly:
    "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal gap is open."
  Do not substitute, hedge, or leave the Finding blank. This exact wording is required.

What the inventory shows:

  Step 1: Name the claimed outcome for {topic}:
    "The claimed outcome is: [outcome]."
    If not stated in any artifact: "The claimed outcome is not named in any artifact --
    this is itself a gap."

  Step 2: Define mechanism evidence -- a causal chain of observable intermediate steps
  from feature to outcome. Not:
    - A correlation ("users who use X have better Y scores")
    - An outcome claim ("users will benefit")
    - A proxy metric ("adoption rate will increase")
  Is: "Feature causes outcome because [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."

  Step 3: Scan every artifact. State one of:
    (a) "Mechanism evidence found: [artifact, date] establishes [mechanism] by tracing
        [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."
    (b) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal
        gap is open."
  Rule 1: form (b) is required when no mechanism evidence exists. Do not leave blank.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]  <- use this value for CAUSAL GAP in the dimensional-status preamble
  Basis: [artifacts checked for mechanism content; if none: "no artifact addresses
    mechanism -- inventory checked: {artifact names}"]
  Finding: [(a) or required absence phrase (b) -- required]

What the team can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: "Run /discover:causal to establish mechanism evidence
    before committing." Rule 2: /discover:causal, not "discover-causal".]

--- Item 2: SEQUENCE ---

Why this matters:
  Commitment tends to foreclose investigation. A spec written before any discovery
  signal existed reflects a direction chosen before the team knew what they were
  committing to. Ordering is a fact -- check it before interpreting it.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no discovery artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering cannot be established."
  Do not write SEQUENCE OK when no discovery artifacts were checked.

What the inventory shows:
  Classify each artifact as discovery (discover, scout, prove, research, listen) or
  commitment (draft, topic, program). Note the date of each.

  Compare dates. State one of:
    (a) "Discovery precedes commitment: [discovery artifact, date] predates [commitment
        artifact, date]."
    (b) "Commitment precedes discovery: [commitment artifact, date] predates [discovery
        artifact, date]. Inversion flagged."
    (c) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering
        cannot be established."
  Rule 1: form (c) is required when no discovery artifacts exist.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]  <- use this value for SEQUENCE in the dimensional-status preamble
  Basis: [artifact names and dates compared; if no discovery artifacts: "no discovery
    artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [(a), (b), or required absence phrase (c) -- required]

What the team can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the missing discovery signal and skill using
    /namespace:skill format -- Rule 2]

--- Item 3: STALENESS ---

Why this matters:
  Domain velocity determines how long a signal stays trustworthy. Fast-moving
  markets make 30-day-old competitive signals unreliable. Stable enterprise cycles
  may hold at 90 days. The team's threshold should match the domain, not a default.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no dated artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."
  Do not apply a threshold to an empty inventory without noting the absence.

What the inventory shows:
  First, name the threshold:
    "For {topic}'s domain: signals older than [N] days are stale because [reason]."

  Apply to each artifact. State which are within threshold and which are past it.
  Rule 1: if no dated artifacts, write the required absence phrase above.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]  <- use this value for STALENESS in the dimensional-status preamble
  Basis: [each artifact with date; or "no dated artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [fresh/stale breakdown by name; OR required absence phrase:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."]

What the team can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the stale artifact, its age vs. threshold, and the
    skill to refresh it -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

--- Item 4: COHERENCE ---

Why this matters:
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment. Two signals addressing the same
  question should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be named and deliberate.
  The team should see the contradiction before it sees the consequences.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What the inventory shows:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]  <- use this value for COHERENCE in the dimensional-status preamble
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What the team can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===
[FUNCTION: Root-cause synthesis. Two or more FLAG/OPEN items sharing a root can be
 closed with a single action. This section names that root and that action. If all
 items are OK, this section confirms no pattern exists -- it does not silently pass.]

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

Addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with a single action. Look for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase explains both --
    run /discover:causal to address the root.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: premature commitment is the root; mechanism gap
    is a downstream symptom of the same inversion.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: a stale signal is often the source of the
    contradiction -- refreshing it may resolve both.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===
[FUNCTION: Actionable gap map. Every FLAG or OPEN dimension maps to a runnable skill.
 A reviewer reading this section should be able to assign the next action without
 reading the preflight items. Rule 1 and Rule 2 both apply to every line.]

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."

=== ARTIFACT ===
[FUNCTION: Persist the health report. Frontmatter fields are machine-readable;
 the artifact is the ground truth for any future /signal:check run on this topic.
 The dimensional_status_preamble field records whether the preamble structure was present.]

Write to simulations/signal/check/{topic}-check-{date}.md.

## R18 Design Notes

**STANDING RULES invariant**: Identical C-46 PASS ceiling across all five. R17 confirmed
"no live axis from V-05" -- the STANDING RULES block has reached its ceiling form and all
five R18 variations hold it constant.

**Why all five score 38/38 under v17**: The v17 rubric has no criterion corresponding to
any R18 new axis. All five variations satisfy C-01 through C-46 because they carry the
C-46 PASS STANDING RULES block and maintain all existing structural requirements. The
live R18 axis (dimensional-status preamble in V-05) would become C-47 in a future rubric
version (v18), not in v17.

**Axis independence proofs**:
- V-01 (A alone) vs. V-02 (B alone): coaching vocabulary does not introduce a scan table;
  a scan table does not introduce coaching vocabulary. Independent.
- V-01 (A alone) vs. V-03 (C alone): coaching vocabulary does not introduce section-function
  annotations; annotations do not require coaching vocabulary. Independent.
- V-02 (B alone) vs. V-03 (C alone): a scan table in the preflight check does not introduce
  section-function annotations in headers; annotations do not require a scan table. Independent.
- V-04 (A+B) vs. V-05 (A+B+C + live axis): V-04 carries both A and B; the only difference
  in V-05 is the dimensional-status preamble in READINESS SUMMARY (the live axis) plus
  the section-function annotations (C). The preamble's absence in V-04 confirms it is
  independently testable from A, B, and their combination.

**Live R19 axis**: Not yet visible. V-05's dimensional-status preamble closes the
READINESS SUMMARY loop. The scan table's four-row completeness (all four dimensions
present in the table) may carry a sub-criterion, but no discriminating boundary has
been established yet -- that would be the R19 exploration territory.
