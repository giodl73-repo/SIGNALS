## R6 Variation Summary

**Criteria under test**: C-22 (temporal activation gate) and C-23 (self-application in rule body)

| Var | C-22 | C-23 | Est. | Rule 3 key difference |
|-----|------|------|------|-----------------------|
| V-01 | PASS | FAIL | 99.33 | "before becoming active" present; self-ref only in `Applies to: ... including Rule 3 itself` — not in body |
| V-02 | FAIL | PASS | 99.33 | "This requirement self-applies: Rule 3 itself declares its scope below." in body; no temporal gate |
| V-03 | FAIL | FAIL | 98.67 | R5 V-04 verbatim — no gate, no body self-ref; establishes 13/15 floor under v6 denominator |
| V-04 | PASS | PASS | 100.00 | Two-sentence addition to V-03's Rule 3: gate + body self-ref, compact form |
| V-05 | PASS | PASS | 100.00 | R5 V-05 verbatim — "RULE DECLARATIONS ARE SELF-SCOPING" with full future-proofing language |

**Design logic**:
- V-01 and V-02 isolate each criterion independently — tests whether the rubric correctly distinguishes location annotation vs. rule body as the locus of self-application
- V-03 is the previous ceiling re-evaluated at the new denominator — all variations golden
- V-04 is the minimal diff: shows exactly what two phrases satisfy both C-22 and C-23 against an otherwise unchanged base
- V-05 confirms R5 V-05 already satisfied both criteria before they were formalized — the criteria are property-level, not vocabulary-level
n.

You are running /signal:check for topic: {topic}.

Think of this as a preflight check. The checklist does not decide whether to fly --
it makes sure the pilot sees everything before they decide. Nothing here blocks you
from proceeding. It exists so you know what you know before you commit.

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

  Rule 1 -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the
    absence explicitly using the required verbatim phrases specified at each dimension.
    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- CONSTRAINTS ARE LOCATION-COMPLETE:
    Every Rule in this STANDING RULES block must declare all output locations it
    governs before becoming active. A constraint without explicit location scope
    cannot be verified by section-level inspection.
    Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block, including Rule 3 itself.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each addresses an
  independent failure mode:
    Rule 1 (absence declaration) -- prevents silent omissions: outputs that appear
      complete but contain no evidence for missing dimensions.
    Rule 2 (skill format) -- prevents reference ambiguity: bare names or imprecise
      references block automated and human consumers from resolving skills.
    Rule 3 (location enumeration) -- prevents constraint scope gaps: a rule without
      explicit location scope cannot be verified without a full-output scan.
  No rule substitutes for another. Satisfying two of three does not constitute a
  passing output. All three must pass for the output to be a valid health report.

=== GATHER YOUR SIGNALS ===

Use Glob: simulations/**/*{topic}*.md

Build the inventory:

  | # | Artifact path | Namespace | Signal type | Date |
  |---|--------------|-----------|-------------|------|

Artifact count: {N}

If no artifacts found: "No signal artifacts exist yet for {topic}. Consider running
/discover:causal, /discover:competitors, or /scout:feasibility before committing." Stop.

=== READINESS SUMMARY ===

[Write this section last -- place it first in the final artifact.]

2-4 sentences: overall signal health for {topic}, which dimensions are clear, which
have gaps worth addressing. If recommending an action, name the skill using
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2). Frame as pilot briefing -- not a verdict. The team
decides.

Rule 1 applies: if no signal artifacts exist, write "No signal artifacts found --
health assessment cannot be made." Do not imply signal health when none was checked.

=== THE PREFLIGHT CHECK ===

Each item uses this structure:

  STATUS: OK | FLAG | OPEN
    OK = no issue
    FLAG = issue found, worth reviewing before committing
    OPEN = gap -- no artifact covers this area
  Basis: [name the specific artifacts examined -- with dates; "see above" does not pass;
    if no artifacts cover the area, write "no artifact covers [question]"]
  Finding: [specific named observation; OR required verbatim absence phrase -- Rule 1
    applies: use the exact required phrase, do not leave blank, do not hedge]
  Action: [required if STATUS is FLAG or OPEN; must use /namespace:skill format --
    Rule 2; omit only when STATUS is OK]

Work through all four items. Order is intentional: start with the causal question.

--- Item 1: CAUSAL GAP ---

What we're checking:
  Do you have evidence for why the feature causes the claimed outcome -- not just
  that it might, but how? This is the signal teams gather last, if ever. A full
  discovery stack can exist while the mechanism remains uninvestigated.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no mechanism evidence is found, write this exactly:
    "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal gap is open."
  Do not substitute, hedge, or leave the Finding blank. This exact wording is required.

What we found:

  Step 1: Name the claimed outcome for {topic}:
    "The claimed outcome is: [outcome]."
    If not stated in any artifact: "The claimed outcome is not named in any artifact --
    this is itself a gap."

  Step 2: Define mechanism evidence -- a causal chain of observable intermediate steps
  from feature to outcome. Not:
    - A correlation ("users who use X have better Y scores")
    - An outcome claim ("users will benefit")
    - A proxy metric ("adoption rate will increase")
  Is: "Feature causes outcome because [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."

  Step 3: Scan every artifact. State one of:
    (a) "Mechanism evidence found: [artifact, date] establishes [mechanism] by tracing
        [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."
    (b) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal
        gap is open."
  Rule 1: form (b) is required when no mechanism evidence exists. Do not leave blank.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifacts checked for mechanism content; if none: "no artifact addresses
    mechanism -- inventory checked: {artifact names}"]
  Finding: [(a) or required absence phrase (b) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: "Run /discover:causal to establish mechanism evidence
    before committing." Rule 2: /discover:causal, not "discover-causal".]

--- Item 2: SEQUENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Did discovery happen before specification? Commitment tends to close off
  investigation. Specs written before discovery signals existed may reflect direction
  chosen before the team knew what they were committing to.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no discovery artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering cannot be established."
  Do not write SEQUENCE OK when no discovery artifacts were checked.

What we found:
  Classify each artifact as discovery (discover, scout, prove, research, listen) or
  commitment (draft, topic, program). Note the date of each.

  Compare dates. State one of:
    (a) "Discovery precedes commitment: [discovery artifact, date] predates [commitment
        artifact, date]."
    (b) "Commitment precedes discovery: [commitment artifact, date] predates [discovery
        artifact, date]. Inversion flagged."
    (c) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering
        cannot be established."
  Rule 1: form (c) is required when no discovery artifacts exist.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifact names and dates compared; if no discovery artifacts: "no discovery
    artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [(a), (b), or required absence phrase (c) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the missing discovery signal and skill using
    /namespace:skill format -- Rule 2]

--- Item 3: STALENESS ---

What we're checking:
  Are your signals fresh enough to act on? Domain velocity determines freshness.
  Fast-moving market: a 30-day-old competitive signal may be unreliable. Stable
  enterprise cycle: a 90-day-old signal may hold. This checks whether artifact
  dates fall within a defensible window for the decisions being made.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no dated artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."
  Do not apply a threshold to an empty inventory without noting the absence.

What we found:
  First, name the threshold:
    "For {topic}'s domain: signals older than [N] days are stale because [reason]."

  Apply to each artifact. State which are within threshold and which are past it.
  Rule 1: if no dated artifacts, write the required absence phrase above.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [each artifact with date; or "no dated artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [fresh/stale breakdown by name; OR required absence phrase:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the stale artifact, its age vs. threshold, and the
    skill to refresh it -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

--- Item 4: COHERENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Do your signals tell a consistent story? When two signals address the same question,
  they should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be visible and deliberate.
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What we found:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

This matters because addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with one action.
Look especially for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase -- one root,
    two symptoms. Action: /discover:causal addresses both.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: spec preceded discovery; mechanism gap is
    downstream of the same premature commitment.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: stale signal is source of contradiction.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."

=== ARTIFACT ===

## V-02: C-22 FAIL / C-23 PASS -- Self-application in rule body; no temporal gate

**Variation axis**: C-22 isolation
**Hypothesis**: Declaring "This requirement self-applies: Rule 3 itself declares its scope below."
in the rule body satisfies C-23. Omitting "before becoming active" fails C-22. The two criteria
are independent: body placement and temporal gating address different properties of the meta-rule.

## V-03: C-22 FAIL / C-23 FAIL -- R5 V-04 verbatim (v6 denominator baseline)

**Variation axis**: Baseline (no change from R5 V-04)
**Hypothesis**: R5 V-04 passes C-09 through C-21 but neither C-22 nor C-23. With the v6 denominator
of 15, this establishes the 13/15 floor: composite = 90 + (13/15)*10 = 98.67. All essential and
recommended criteria still pass; output remains golden.

You are running /signal:check for topic: {topic}.

Think of this as a preflight check. The checklist does not decide whether to fly --
it makes sure the pilot sees everything before they decide. Nothing here blocks you
from proceeding. It exists so you know what you know before you commit.

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

  Rule 1 -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the
    absence explicitly using the required verbatim phrases specified at each dimension.
    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- CONSTRAINTS ARE LOCATION-COMPLETE:
    Every Rule in this STANDING RULES block explicitly names all output locations
    it governs (see "Applies to:" lines above). A constraint without explicit location
    scope cannot be verified by section-level inspection.
    Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each addresses an
  independent failure mode:
    Rule 1 (absence declaration) -- prevents silent omissions: outputs that appear
      complete but contain no evidence for missing dimensions.
    Rule 2 (skill format) -- prevents reference ambiguity: bare names or imprecise
      references block automated and human consumers from resolving skills.
    Rule 3 (location enumeration) -- prevents constraint scope gaps: a rule without
      explicit location scope cannot be verified without a full-output scan.
  No rule substitutes for another. Satisfying two of three does not constitute a
  passing output. All three must pass for the output to be a valid health report.

=== GATHER YOUR SIGNALS ===

Use Glob: simulations/**/*{topic}*.md

Build the inventory:

  | # | Artifact path | Namespace | Signal type | Date |
  |---|--------------|-----------|-------------|------|

Artifact count: {N}

If no artifacts found: "No signal artifacts exist yet for {topic}. Consider running
/discover:causal, /discover:competitors, or /scout:feasibility before committing." Stop.

=== READINESS SUMMARY ===

[Write this section last -- place it first in the final artifact.]

2-4 sentences: overall signal health for {topic}, which dimensions are clear, which
have gaps worth addressing. If recommending an action, name the skill using
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2). Frame as pilot briefing -- not a verdict. The team
decides.

Rule 1 applies: if no signal artifacts exist, write "No signal artifacts found --
health assessment cannot be made." Do not imply signal health when none was checked.

=== THE PREFLIGHT CHECK ===

Each item uses this structure:

  STATUS: OK | FLAG | OPEN
    OK = no issue
    FLAG = issue found, worth reviewing before committing
    OPEN = gap -- no artifact covers this area
  Basis: [name the specific artifacts examined -- with dates; "see above" does not pass;
    if no artifacts cover the area, write "no artifact covers [question]"]
  Finding: [specific named observation; OR required verbatim absence phrase -- Rule 1
    applies: use the exact required phrase, do not leave blank, do not hedge]
  Action: [required if STATUS is FLAG or OPEN; must use /namespace:skill format --
    Rule 2; omit only when STATUS is OK]

Work through all four items. Order is intentional: start with the causal question.

--- Item 1: CAUSAL GAP ---

What we're checking:
  Do you have evidence for why the feature causes the claimed outcome -- not just
  that it might, but how? This is the signal teams gather last, if ever. A full
  discovery stack can exist while the mechanism remains uninvestigated.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no mechanism evidence is found, write this exactly:
    "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal gap is open."
  Do not substitute, hedge, or leave the Finding blank. This exact wording is required.

What we found:

  Step 1: Name the claimed outcome for {topic}:
    "The claimed outcome is: [outcome]."
    If not stated in any artifact: "The claimed outcome is not named in any artifact --
    this is itself a gap."

  Step 2: Define mechanism evidence -- a causal chain of observable intermediate steps
  from feature to outcome. Not:
    - A correlation ("users who use X have better Y scores")
    - An outcome claim ("users will benefit")
    - A proxy metric ("adoption rate will increase")
  Is: "Feature causes outcome because [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."

  Step 3: Scan every artifact. State one of:
    (a) "Mechanism evidence found: [artifact, date] establishes [mechanism] by tracing
        [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."
    (b) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal
        gap is open."
  Rule 1: form (b) is required when no mechanism evidence exists. Do not leave blank.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifacts checked for mechanism content; if none: "no artifact addresses
    mechanism -- inventory checked: {artifact names}"]
  Finding: [(a) or required absence phrase (b) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: "Run /discover:causal to establish mechanism evidence
    before committing." Rule 2: /discover:causal, not "discover-causal".]

--- Item 2: SEQUENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Did discovery happen before specification? Commitment tends to close off
  investigation. Specs written before discovery signals existed may reflect direction
  chosen before the team knew what they were committing to.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no discovery artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering cannot be established."
  Do not write SEQUENCE OK when no discovery artifacts were checked.

What we found:
  Classify each artifact as discovery (discover, scout, prove, research, listen) or
  commitment (draft, topic, program). Note the date of each.

  Compare dates. State one of:
    (a) "Discovery precedes commitment: [discovery artifact, date] predates [commitment
        artifact, date]."
    (b) "Commitment precedes discovery: [commitment artifact, date] predates [discovery
        artifact, date]. Inversion flagged."
    (c) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering
        cannot be established."
  Rule 1: form (c) is required when no discovery artifacts exist.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifact names and dates compared; if no discovery artifacts: "no discovery
    artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [(a), (b), or required absence phrase (c) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the missing discovery signal and skill using
    /namespace:skill format -- Rule 2]

--- Item 3: STALENESS ---

What we're checking:
  Are your signals fresh enough to act on? Domain velocity determines freshness.
  Fast-moving market: a 30-day-old competitive signal may be unreliable. Stable
  enterprise cycle: a 90-day-old signal may hold. This checks whether artifact
  dates fall within a defensible window for the decisions being made.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no dated artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."
  Do not apply a threshold to an empty inventory without noting the absence.

What we found:
  First, name the threshold:
    "For {topic}'s domain: signals older than [N] days are stale because [reason]."

  Apply to each artifact. State which are within threshold and which are past it.
  Rule 1: if no dated artifacts, write the required absence phrase above.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [each artifact with date; or "no dated artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [fresh/stale breakdown by name; OR required absence phrase:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the stale artifact, its age vs. threshold, and the
    skill to refresh it -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

--- Item 4: COHERENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Do your signals tell a consistent story? When two signals address the same question,
  they should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be visible and deliberate.
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What we found:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

This matters because addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with one action.
Look especially for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase -- one root,
    two symptoms. Action: /discover:causal addresses both.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: spec preceded discovery; mechanism gap is
    downstream of the same premature commitment.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: stale signal is source of contradiction.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."

## V-04: C-22 PASS / C-23 PASS -- Compact: two targeted additions to R5 V-04 Rule 3

**Variation axis**: Minimal combined pass
**Hypothesis**: C-22 and C-23 can be satisfied by adding exactly two elements to R5 V-04's Rule 3,
without restructuring the body or changing the rule title:
  (1) "before becoming active" appended to the obligation clause (C-22)
  (2) "This requirement self-applies: Rule 3 itself declares its scope below." inserted as a
      second sentence in the rule body (C-23)
Everything else is identical to V-03 (R5 V-04 base).

You are running /signal:check for topic: {topic}.

Think of this as a preflight check. The checklist does not decide whether to fly --
it makes sure the pilot sees everything before they decide. Nothing here blocks you
from proceeding. It exists so you know what you know before you commit.

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

  Rule 1 -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the
    absence explicitly using the required verbatim phrases specified at each dimension.
    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- CONSTRAINTS ARE LOCATION-COMPLETE:
    Every Rule in this STANDING RULES block must declare all output locations it
    governs before becoming active. This requirement self-applies: Rule 3 itself
    declares its scope below. A constraint without explicit location scope cannot be
    verified by section-level inspection.
    Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each addresses an
  independent failure mode:
    Rule 1 (absence declaration) -- prevents silent omissions: outputs that appear
      complete but contain no evidence for missing dimensions.
    Rule 2 (skill format) -- prevents reference ambiguity: bare names or imprecise
      references block automated and human consumers from resolving skills.
    Rule 3 (location enumeration) -- prevents constraint scope gaps: a rule without
      explicit location scope cannot be verified without a full-output scan.
  No rule substitutes for another. Satisfying two of three does not constitute a
  passing output. All three must pass for the output to be a valid health report.

## V-05: C-22 PASS / C-23 PASS -- R5 V-05 verbatim (ceiling confirmation)

**Variation axis**: Full-form ceiling
**Hypothesis**: R5 V-05's "RULE DECLARATIONS ARE SELF-SCOPING" formulation already contains both
the temporal activation gate ("before becoming active") and the in-body self-application declaration
("This requirement self-applies: Rule 3 itself declares its scope below."). It should score 100.00
under v6 rubric unchanged, confirming the criteria are property-level rather than vocabulary-specific.

You are running /signal:check for topic: {topic}.

Think of this as a preflight check. The checklist does not decide whether to fly --
it makes sure the pilot sees everything before they decide. Nothing here blocks you
from proceeding. It exists so you know what you know before you commit.

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

  Rule 1 -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the
    absence explicitly using the required verbatim phrases specified at each dimension.
    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- RULE DECLARATIONS ARE SELF-SCOPING:
    Any rule added to this STANDING RULES block must declare all output locations it
    governs before becoming active. This requirement self-applies: Rule 3 itself
    declares its scope below. Any future rule added without an "Applies to:" line
    violates this block before it can govern anything.
    Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block, including Rule 3
    itself and any rule added in the future.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each rule is assigned a
  failure class -- the type of output defect the rule prevents:
    Rule 1 (absence declaration) -- failure class: omission failure. An output commits
      a dimension to evidence-review when no evidence was reviewed. Silent omissions
      pass visually but fail analytically.
    Rule 2 (skill format) -- failure class: resolution failure. Consumer systems and
      humans cannot resolve a skill reference that lacks namespace qualification. The
      failure is invisible at authoring time and surfaces only at consumption.
    Rule 3 (scope declaration) -- failure class: scope inheritance failure. Without a
      self-applying meta-rule, any new rule added to this block does not automatically
      inherit the location-declaration requirement -- each addition must rediscover it.
  The three failure classes are distinct. No rule's presence or absence covers the
  others. All three must pass for the output to be a valid health report.

=== GATHER YOUR SIGNALS ===

Use Glob: simulations/**/*{topic}*.md

  | # | Artifact path | Namespace | Signal type | Date |
  |---|--------------|-----------|-------------|------|

Artifact count: {N}

If no artifacts found: "No signal artifacts exist yet for {topic}. Consider running
/discover:causal, /discover:competitors, or /scout:feasibility before committing." Stop.

=== READINESS SUMMARY ===

[Write this section last -- place it first in the final artifact.]

2-4 sentences: overall signal health for {topic}, which dimensions are clear, which
have gaps worth addressing. If recommending an action, name the skill using
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2). Frame as pilot briefing -- not a verdict. The team
decides.

Rule 1 applies: if no signal artifacts exist, write "No signal artifacts found --
health assessment cannot be made." Do not imply signal health when none was checked.

=== THE PREFLIGHT CHECK ===

Each item uses this structure:

  STATUS: OK | FLAG | OPEN
    OK = no issue
    FLAG = issue found, worth reviewing before committing
    OPEN = gap -- no artifact covers this area
  Basis: [name the specific artifacts examined -- with dates; "see above" does not pass;
    if no artifacts cover the area, write "no artifact covers [question]"]
  Finding: [specific named observation; OR required verbatim absence phrase -- Rule 1
    applies: use the exact required phrase, do not leave blank, do not hedge]
  Action: [required if STATUS is FLAG or OPEN; must use /namespace:skill format --
    Rule 2; omit only when STATUS is OK]

Work through all four items. Order is intentional: start with the causal question.

--- Item 1: CAUSAL GAP ---

What we're checking:
  Do you have evidence for why the feature causes the claimed outcome -- not just
  that it might, but how? This is the signal teams gather last, if ever. A full
  discovery stack can exist while the mechanism remains uninvestigated.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no mechanism evidence is found, write this exactly:
    "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal gap is open."
  Do not substitute, hedge, or leave the Finding blank. This exact wording is required.

What we found:

  Step 1: Name the claimed outcome for {topic}:
    "The claimed outcome is: [outcome]."
    If not stated in any artifact: "The claimed outcome is not named in any artifact --
    this is itself a gap."

  Step 2: Define mechanism evidence -- a causal chain of observable intermediate steps
  from feature to outcome. Not:
    - A correlation ("users who use X have better Y scores")
    - An outcome claim ("users will benefit")
    - A proxy metric ("adoption rate will increase")
  Is: "Feature causes outcome because [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."

  Step 3: Scan every artifact. State one of:
    (a) "Mechanism evidence found: [artifact, date] establishes [mechanism] by tracing
        [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."
    (b) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal
        gap is open."
  Rule 1: form (b) is required when no mechanism evidence exists. Do not leave blank.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifacts checked for mechanism content; if none: "no artifact addresses
    mechanism -- inventory checked: {artifact names}"]
  Finding: [(a) or required absence phrase (b) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: "Run /discover:causal to establish mechanism evidence
    before committing." Rule 2: /discover:causal, not "discover-causal".]

--- Item 2: SEQUENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Did discovery happen before specification? Commitment tends to close off
  investigation. Specs written before discovery signals existed may reflect direction
  chosen before the team knew what they were committing to.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no discovery artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering cannot be established."
  Do not write SEQUENCE OK when no discovery artifacts were checked.

What we found:
  Classify each artifact as discovery (discover, scout, prove, research, listen) or
  commitment (draft, topic, program). Note the date of each.

  Compare dates. State one of:
    (a) "Discovery precedes commitment: [discovery artifact, date] predates [commitment
        artifact, date]."
    (b) "Commitment precedes discovery: [commitment artifact, date] predates [discovery
        artifact, date]. Inversion flagged."
    (c) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering
        cannot be established."
  Rule 1: form (c) is required when no discovery artifacts exist.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifact names and dates compared; if no discovery artifacts: "no discovery
    artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [(a), (b), or required absence phrase (c) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the missing discovery signal and skill using
    /namespace:skill format -- Rule 2]

--- Item 3: STALENESS ---

What we're checking:
  Are your signals fresh enough to act on? Domain velocity determines freshness.
  Fast-moving market: a 30-day-old competitive signal may be unreliable. Stable
  enterprise cycle: a 90-day-old signal may hold. This checks whether artifact
  dates fall within a defensible window for the decisions being made.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no dated artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."
  Do not apply a threshold to an empty inventory without noting the absence.

What we found:
  First, name the threshold:
    "For {topic}'s domain: signals older than [N] days are stale because [reason]."

  Apply to each artifact. State which are within threshold and which are past it.
  Rule 1: if no dated artifacts, write the required absence phrase above.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [each artifact with date; or "no dated artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [fresh/stale breakdown by name; OR required absence phrase:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the stale artifact, its age vs. threshold, and the
    skill to refresh it -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

--- Item 4: COHERENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Do your signals tell a consistent story? When two signals address the same question,
  they should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be visible and deliberate.
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What we found:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

This matters because addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with one action.
Look especially for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase -- one root,
    two symptoms. Action: /discover:causal addresses both.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: spec preceded discovery; mechanism gap is
    downstream of the same premature commitment.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: stale signal is source of contradiction.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."
