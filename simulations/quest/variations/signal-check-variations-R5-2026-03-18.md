**R5 axis matrix:**

| V | C-20 (meta-rule self-applies) | C-21 (failure classes) | Est. composite |
|---|-------------------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| V-01 | PASS | FAIL | 99.23 |
| V-02 | FAIL | PASS | 99.23 |
| V-03 | FAIL | FAIL | 98.46 |
| V-04 | PASS | PASS | 100.00 |
| V-05 | PASS (alt) | PASS (alt) | 100.00 |

**Three single-axis research questions:**

1. **C-20 alone (V-01):** Does Rule 3 self-application ("including itself and any rule added in the future") satisfy C-20 independently of failure-class vocabulary?

2. **C-21 alone (V-02):** Do named failure classes per rule (absence drift / reference ambiguity / unverifiable constraint) satisfy C-21 independently of whether Rule 3 is a true meta-rule?

3. **C-20/C-21 independence (V-01 vs V-02 vs V-03):** Each single-axis variation should score exactly 1 above V-03 (the baseline), confirming zero overlap between the two criteria.

**V-03** is the R4 V-04 structural equivalent (non-self-applying Rule 3, generic interdependency note only) — confirms the v5 denominator shift and sets the joint-absence floor.

**V-05** tests phrasing-agnosticism: "RULE DECLARATIONS ARE SELF-SCOPING" / "before becoming active" for C-20, and "omission / resolution / scope inheritance failure" for C-21. If either fails, a phrasing-agnosticism declaration becomes the R6 candidate.
/C-21 independence (V-01 vs. V-02 vs. V-03):** Are C-20 and C-21 independently
   countable -- i.e., do the V-01 and V-02 scores each exceed V-03 by exactly one criterion?
   Confirms the two criteria are non-overlapping additions with no mutual dependency.

**V-03 = R4 V-04 structural equivalent** (Rules 1+2 with Applies-to, ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE
with generic interdependency, no meta-rule, no failure classes). Carried forward to confirm
score under the v5 denominator (13 aspirational vs. v4's 11). Expected: 11/13 (C-20 and C-21
both miss).

## V-01: C-20 alone -- Self-Applying Meta-Rule Without Per-Rule Failure Classes

**Axis:** C-20 PASS (Rule 3 expressed as self-applying meta-rule governing all rule
declarations) + C-21 FAIL (ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE declares interdependency but does not
assign named failure classes to each rule).

**Hypothesis:** C-20 is independently satisfied by Rule 3 stating "this requirement is
self-applying -- it covers all Rule declarations in this block including itself and any
added in the future." The forward-compatibility framing is what distinguishes a meta-rule
from a standard location-complete rule. C-21 is independently testable: an enforcement stack
can declare three rules as addressing independent failure modes without labeling what each
failure mode is. V-01 tests the C-20/C-21 boundary: meta-rule present, failure-class taxonomy
absent.

**Expected Score:** 99.23 (5/5 essential, 3/3 recommended, 12/13 aspirational -- C-21 fails)

You are running /signal:check for topic: {topic}.

Think of this as a preflight check. The checklist does not decide whether to fly --
it makes sure the pilot sees everything before they decide. Nothing here blocks you
from proceeding. It exists so you know what you know before you commit.

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

  Rule 1 -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the
    absence explicitly using the required verbatim phrases specified at each dimension.
    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- CONSTRAINTS ARE LOCATION-COMPLETE:
    Every Rule in this STANDING RULES block explicitly names all output locations
    it governs (see "Applies to:" lines above). A constraint without explicit location
    scope cannot be verified by section-level inspection. This requirement is
    self-applying: it covers Rule 3 itself and any Rule added to this block in the
    future. A new Rule added without an "Applies to:" line does not pass this block.
    Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block, present and future.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. The three rules address
  independent failure modes: satisfying any two does not cover the failure addressed
  by the third. No rule substitutes for another. Satisfying two of three does not
  constitute a passing output. All three must pass for the output to be a valid
  health report.

=== GATHER YOUR SIGNALS ===

Use Glob: simulations/**/*{topic}*.md

Build the inventory:

  | # | Artifact path | Namespace | Signal type | Date |
  |---|--------------|-----------|-------------|------|

Artifact count: {N}

If no artifacts found: "No signal artifacts exist yet for {topic}. Consider running
/discover:causal, /discover:competitors, or /scout:feasibility before committing." Stop.

=== READINESS SUMMARY ===

[Write this section last -- place it first in the final artifact.]

2-4 sentences: overall signal health for {topic}, which dimensions are clear, which
have gaps worth addressing. If recommending an action, name the skill using
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2). Frame as pilot briefing -- not a verdict. The team
decides.

Rule 1 applies: if no signal artifacts exist, write "No signal artifacts found --
health assessment cannot be made." Do not imply signal health when none was checked.

=== THE PREFLIGHT CHECK ===

Each item uses this structure:

  STATUS: OK | FLAG | OPEN
    OK = no issue
    FLAG = issue found, worth reviewing before committing
    OPEN = gap -- no artifact covers this area
  Basis: [name the specific artifacts examined -- with dates; "see above" does not pass;
    if no artifacts cover the area, write "no artifact covers [question]"]
  Finding: [specific named observation; OR required verbatim absence phrase -- Rule 1
    applies: use the exact required phrase, do not leave blank, do not hedge]
  Action: [required if STATUS is FLAG or OPEN; must use /namespace:skill format --
    Rule 2; omit only when STATUS is OK]

Work through all four items. Order is intentional: start with the causal question.

--- Item 1: CAUSAL GAP ---

What we're checking:
  Do you have evidence for why the feature causes the claimed outcome -- not just
  that it might, but how? This is the signal teams gather last, if ever. A full
  discovery stack can exist while the mechanism remains uninvestigated.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no mechanism evidence is found, write this exactly:
    "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal gap is open."
  Do not substitute, hedge, or leave the Finding blank. This exact wording is required.

What we found:

  Step 1: Name the claimed outcome for {topic}:
    "The claimed outcome is: [outcome]."
    If not stated in any artifact: "The claimed outcome is not named in any artifact --
    this is itself a gap."

  Step 2: Define mechanism evidence -- a causal chain of observable intermediate steps
  from feature to outcome. Not:
    - A correlation ("users who use X have better Y scores")
    - An outcome claim ("users will benefit")
    - A proxy metric ("adoption rate will increase")
  Is: "Feature causes outcome because [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."

  Step 3: Scan every artifact. State one of:
    (a) "Mechanism evidence found: [artifact, date] establishes [mechanism] by tracing
        [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."
    (b) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal
        gap is open."
  Rule 1: form (b) is required when no mechanism evidence exists. Do not leave blank.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifacts checked for mechanism content; if none: "no artifact addresses
    mechanism -- inventory checked: {artifact names}"]
  Finding: [(a) or required absence phrase (b) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: "Run /discover:causal to establish mechanism evidence
    before committing." Rule 2: /discover:causal, not "discover-causal".]

--- Item 2: SEQUENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Did discovery happen before specification? Commitment tends to close off
  investigation. Specs written before discovery signals existed may reflect direction
  chosen before the team knew what they were committing to.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no discovery artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering cannot be established."
  Do not write SEQUENCE OK when no discovery artifacts were checked.

What we found:
  Classify each artifact as discovery (discover, scout, prove, research, listen) or
  commitment (draft, topic, program). Note the date of each.

  Compare dates. State one of:
    (a) "Discovery precedes commitment: [discovery artifact, date] predates [commitment
        artifact, date]."
    (b) "Commitment precedes discovery: [commitment artifact, date] predates [discovery
        artifact, date]. Inversion flagged."
    (c) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering
        cannot be established."
  Rule 1: form (c) is required when no discovery artifacts exist.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifact names and dates compared; if no discovery artifacts: "no discovery
    artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [(a), (b), or required absence phrase (c) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the missing discovery signal and skill using
    /namespace:skill format -- Rule 2]

--- Item 3: STALENESS ---

What we're checking:
  Are your signals fresh enough to act on? Domain velocity determines freshness.
  Fast-moving market: a 30-day-old competitive signal may be unreliable. Stable
  enterprise cycle: a 90-day-old signal may hold. This checks whether artifact
  dates fall within a defensible window for the decisions being made.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no dated artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."
  Do not apply a threshold to an empty inventory without noting the absence.

What we found:
  First, name the threshold:
    "For {topic}'s domain: signals older than [N] days are stale because [reason]."

  Apply to each artifact. State which are within threshold and which are past it.
  Rule 1: if no dated artifacts, write the required absence phrase above.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [each artifact with date; or "no dated artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [fresh/stale breakdown by name; OR required absence phrase:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the stale artifact, its age vs. threshold, and the
    skill to refresh it -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

--- Item 4: COHERENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Do your signals tell a consistent story? When two signals address the same question,
  they should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be visible and deliberate.
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What we found:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

This matters because addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with one action.
Look especially for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase -- one root,
    two symptoms. Action: /discover:causal addresses both.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: spec preceded discovery; mechanism gap is
    downstream of the same premature commitment.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: stale signal is source of contradiction.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."

## V-02: C-21 alone -- Named Failure Classes Without Self-Applying Meta-Rule

**Axis:** C-21 PASS (ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE assigns a named failure class to each rule)
+ C-20 FAIL (Rule 3 states a location-scope requirement but does not self-apply -- only
enumerates Rule 1 and Rule 2 as its governed locations, not itself or future rules).

**Hypothesis:** C-21 is independently satisfied by the ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE assigning
specific failure-class labels (absence drift / reference ambiguity / location scope violations)
to Rules 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The diagnostic taxonomy is present and each rule is
addressable by failure class without reading the full rule body. C-20 requires the additional
property that the location-enumeration rule self-applies and covers future rule additions --
V-02 tests whether failure-class labeling alone (without the self-application property) is
independently countable. Rule 3 in V-02 carries an "Applies to: Rule 1, Rule 2" line, which
satisfies C-16 (Rule 3 enumerates its governed locations) but not C-20 (the meta-rule property
requires Rule 3 to cover itself and future additions, not only named existing rules).

**Expected Score:** 99.23 (5/5 essential, 3/3 recommended, 12/13 aspirational -- C-20 fails)

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

  Rule 1 -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the
    absence explicitly using the required verbatim phrases specified at each dimension.
    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- LOCATION SCOPE:
    Every Rule in this STANDING RULES block must name the output locations it governs
    using an "Applies to:" line. A constraint without explicit location scope cannot
    be verified by section-level inspection.
    Applies to: Rule 1, Rule 2.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each rule is assigned to a
  named failure class:
    Rule 1 (absence declaration) -- failure class: absence drift. Output appears
      complete but evidence for missing dimensions is silently absent.
    Rule 2 (skill format) -- failure class: reference ambiguity. Bare names or imprecise
      references block automated and human consumers from resolving skills.
    Rule 3 (location scope) -- failure class: unverifiable constraint. A rule without
      an explicit "Applies to:" line cannot be verified by section-level inspection alone.
  No rule substitutes for another. Satisfying two of three does not constitute a
  passing output. All three must pass for the output to be a valid health report.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."

## V-03: Neither C-20 nor C-21 -- R4 V-04 Structural Equivalent

**Axis:** C-20 FAIL (Rule 3 non-self-applying) + C-21 FAIL (ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE declares
interdependency but assigns no named failure classes). This is the R4 V-04 structural
equivalent carried forward to confirm its score under the v5 denominator (13 aspirational).

**Hypothesis:** V-03 should score 11/13 aspirational: passing C-09 through C-19 (all v4
rubric criteria) and failing only C-20 and C-21. Both misses are independent -- the same
structural gap that makes C-20 fail (no self-applying meta-rule) is orthogonal to the gap
that makes C-21 fail (no per-rule failure-class labels). Confirming V-03 at 11/13 validates
the denominator shift from v4 to v5 and establishes the joint-absence baseline for R5.

**Expected Score:** 98.46 (5/5 essential, 3/3 recommended, 11/13 aspirational -- C-20 and
C-21 fail)

You are running /signal:check for topic: {topic}.

Think of this as a preflight check. The checklist does not decide whether to fly --
it makes sure the pilot sees everything before they decide. Nothing here blocks you
from proceeding. It exists so you know what you know before you commit.

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

  Rule 1 -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the
    absence explicitly using the required verbatim phrases specified at each dimension.
    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- LOCATION SCOPE:
    Every Rule in this STANDING RULES block must name the output locations it governs
    using an "Applies to:" line. A constraint without explicit location scope cannot
    be verified by section-level inspection.
    Applies to: Rule 1, Rule 2.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. The three rules address
  independent failure modes: satisfying any two does not cover the failure addressed
  by the third. No rule substitutes for another. Satisfying two of three does not
  constitute a passing output. All three must pass for the output to be a valid
  health report.

=== GATHER YOUR SIGNALS ===

Use Glob: simulations/**/*{topic}*.md

Build the inventory:

  | # | Artifact path | Namespace | Signal type | Date |
  |---|--------------|-----------|-------------|------|

Artifact count: {N}

If no artifacts found: "No signal artifacts exist yet for {topic}. Consider running
/discover:causal, /discover:competitors, or /scout:feasibility before committing." Stop.

=== READINESS SUMMARY ===

[Write this section last -- place it first in the final artifact.]

2-4 sentences: overall signal health for {topic}, which dimensions are clear, which
have gaps worth addressing. If recommending an action, name the skill using
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2). Frame as pilot briefing -- not a verdict. The team
decides.

Rule 1 applies: if no signal artifacts exist, write "No signal artifacts found --
health assessment cannot be made." Do not imply signal health when none was checked.

=== THE PREFLIGHT CHECK ===

Each item uses this structure:

  STATUS: OK | FLAG | OPEN
    OK = no issue
    FLAG = issue found, worth reviewing before committing
    OPEN = gap -- no artifact covers this area
  Basis: [name the specific artifacts examined -- with dates; "see above" does not pass;
    if no artifacts cover the area, write "no artifact covers [question]"]
  Finding: [specific named observation; OR required verbatim absence phrase -- Rule 1
    applies: use the exact required phrase, do not leave blank, do not hedge]
  Action: [required if STATUS is FLAG or OPEN; must use /namespace:skill format --
    Rule 2; omit only when STATUS is OK]

Work through all four items. Order is intentional: start with the causal question.

--- Item 1: CAUSAL GAP ---

What we're checking:
  Do you have evidence for why the feature causes the claimed outcome -- not just
  that it might, but how? This is the signal teams gather last, if ever. A full
  discovery stack can exist while the mechanism remains uninvestigated.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no mechanism evidence is found, write this exactly:
    "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal gap is open."
  Do not substitute, hedge, or leave the Finding blank. This exact wording is required.

What we found:

  Step 1: Name the claimed outcome for {topic}:
    "The claimed outcome is: [outcome]."
    If not stated in any artifact: "The claimed outcome is not named in any artifact --
    this is itself a gap."

  Step 2: Define mechanism evidence -- a causal chain of observable intermediate steps
  from feature to outcome. Not:
    - A correlation ("users who use X have better Y scores")
    - An outcome claim ("users will benefit")
    - A proxy metric ("adoption rate will increase")
  Is: "Feature causes outcome because [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."

  Step 3: Scan every artifact. State one of:
    (a) "Mechanism evidence found: [artifact, date] establishes [mechanism] by tracing
        [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."
    (b) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal
        gap is open."
  Rule 1: form (b) is required when no mechanism evidence exists. Do not leave blank.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifacts checked for mechanism content; if none: "no artifact addresses
    mechanism -- inventory checked: {artifact names}"]
  Finding: [(a) or required absence phrase (b) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: "Run /discover:causal to establish mechanism evidence
    before committing." Rule 2: /discover:causal, not "discover-causal".]

--- Item 2: SEQUENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Did discovery happen before specification? Commitment tends to close off
  investigation. Specs written before discovery signals existed may reflect direction
  chosen before the team knew what they were committing to.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no discovery artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering cannot be established."
  Do not write SEQUENCE OK when no discovery artifacts were checked.

What we found:
  Classify each artifact as discovery (discover, scout, prove, research, listen) or
  commitment (draft, topic, program). Note the date of each.

  Compare dates. State one of:
    (a) "Discovery precedes commitment: [discovery artifact, date] predates [commitment
        artifact, date]."
    (b) "Commitment precedes discovery: [commitment artifact, date] predates [discovery
        artifact, date]. Inversion flagged."
    (c) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering
        cannot be established."
  Rule 1: form (c) is required when no discovery artifacts exist.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifact names and dates compared; if no discovery artifacts: "no discovery
    artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [(a), (b), or required absence phrase (c) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the missing discovery signal and skill using
    /namespace:skill format -- Rule 2]

--- Item 3: STALENESS ---

What we're checking:
  Are your signals fresh enough to act on? Domain velocity determines freshness.
  Fast-moving market: a 30-day-old competitive signal may be unreliable. Stable
  enterprise cycle: a 90-day-old signal may hold. This checks whether artifact
  dates fall within a defensible window for the decisions being made.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no dated artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."
  Do not apply a threshold to an empty inventory without noting the absence.

What we found:
  First, name the threshold:
    "For {topic}'s domain: signals older than [N] days are stale because [reason]."

  Apply to each artifact. State which are within threshold and which are past it.
  Rule 1: if no dated artifacts, write the required absence phrase above.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [each artifact with date; or "no dated artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [fresh/stale breakdown by name; OR required absence phrase:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the stale artifact, its age vs. threshold, and the
    skill to refresh it -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

--- Item 4: COHERENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Do your signals tell a consistent story? When two signals address the same question,
  they should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be visible and deliberate.
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What we found:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

This matters because addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with one action.
Look especially for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase -- one root,
    two symptoms. Action: /discover:causal addresses both.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: spec preceded discovery; mechanism gap is
    downstream of the same premature commitment.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: stale signal is source of contradiction.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."

## V-04: C-20 + C-21 -- R4 V-05 Verbatim (v5 Ceiling Confirmation)

**Axes combined:** C-20 PASS (Rule 3 self-applying meta-rule governing all rule declarations)
+ C-21 PASS (ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE assigns named failure classes to each rule). Identical to
R4 V-05 -- carried forward verbatim to confirm the v5 ceiling score. R4 V-05 was scored at
100.0 under the v4 denominator (11 aspirational); V-04 here confirms whether it also scores
13/13 aspirational under the v5 denominator. The two new criteria (C-20, C-21) were derived
from patterns in R4 V-05, so V-04 is expected to pass both.

**Hypothesis:** R4 V-05 already contains the structural features that define C-20 and C-21.
Rule 3 ("CONSTRAINTS ARE LOCATION-COMPLETE") carries "Applies to: all Rule declarations in
this STANDING RULES block" -- this is the meta-rule property C-20 requires. The ENFORCEMENT
STACK NOTE names absence drift / reference ambiguity / constraint scope gaps as the three
failure classes -- this is the diagnostic taxonomy C-21 requires. V-04 should score 13/13
aspirational = 100.00 composite.

**Expected Score:** 100.00 (5/5 essential, 3/3 recommended, 13/13 aspirational)

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

  Rule 1 -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the
    absence explicitly using the required verbatim phrases specified at each dimension.
    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- CONSTRAINTS ARE LOCATION-COMPLETE:
    Every Rule in this STANDING RULES block explicitly names all output locations
    it governs (see "Applies to:" lines above). A constraint without explicit location
    scope cannot be verified by section-level inspection.
    Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each addresses an
  independent failure mode:
    Rule 1 (absence declaration) -- prevents silent omissions: outputs that appear
      complete but contain no evidence for missing dimensions.
    Rule 2 (skill format) -- prevents reference ambiguity: bare names or imprecise
      references block automated and human consumers from resolving skills.
    Rule 3 (location enumeration) -- prevents constraint scope gaps: a rule without
      explicit location scope cannot be verified without a full-output scan.
  No rule substitutes for another. Satisfying two of three does not constitute a
  passing output. All three must pass for the output to be a valid health report.

## V-05: C-20 + C-21 (Alternative Forms) -- Forward-Compatibility Framing + Typed Failure Classes

**Axes combined:** C-20 PASS (alternative meta-rule form using forward-compatibility framing
-- "any rule added to this block must declare its scope before becoming active") + C-21 PASS
(alternative failure class vocabulary -- "omission failure / resolution failure / scope
inheritance failure" rather than R4 V-05's "absence drift / reference ambiguity / constraint
scope gaps"). Both criteria are property-level: C-20 requires the self-application property,
not a specific phrase; C-21 requires a named failure class per rule, not specific class names.

**Hypothesis:** C-20 is phrasing-agnostic: any form that makes the location-enumeration
requirement self-applying and prospective satisfies it. V-05 tests whether explicitly naming
the forward-compatibility purpose ("any rule added in the future must also declare its scope
before becoming active") satisfies C-20 as well as V-04's "Applies to: all Rule declarations
in this STANDING RULES block." C-21 is similarly phrasing-agnostic: the failure class names
are a taxonomy, and different vocabulary ("scope inheritance failure" vs. "constraint scope
gaps") should satisfy the diagnostic criterion equally. V-05 confirms the property-level
nature of both criteria. If either alternative phrasing fails, a phrasing-agnosticism
declaration would be warranted for R6.

**Expected Score:** 100.00 (5/5 essential, 3/3 recommended, 13/13 aspirational)

    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- RULE DECLARATIONS ARE SELF-SCOPING:
    Any rule added to this STANDING RULES block must declare all output locations it
    governs before becoming active. This requirement self-applies: Rule 3 itself
    declares its scope below. Any future rule added without an "Applies to:" line
    violates this block before it can govern anything.
    Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block, including Rule 3
    itself and any rule added in the future.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each rule is assigned a
  failure class -- the type of output defect the rule prevents:
    Rule 1 (absence declaration) -- failure class: omission failure. An output commits
      a dimension to evidence-review when no evidence was reviewed. Silent omissions
      pass visually but fail analytically.
    Rule 2 (skill format) -- failure class: resolution failure. Consumer systems and
      humans cannot resolve a skill reference that lacks namespace qualification. The
      failure is invisible at authoring time and surfaces only at consumption.
    Rule 3 (scope declaration) -- failure class: scope inheritance failure. Without a
      self-applying meta-rule, any new rule added to this block does not automatically
      inherit the location-declaration requirement -- each addition must rediscover it.
  The three failure classes are distinct. No rule's presence or absence covers the
  others. All three must pass for the output to be a valid health report.

=== GATHER YOUR SIGNALS ===

Use Glob: simulations/**/*{topic}*.md

Build the inventory:

  | # | Artifact path | Namespace | Signal type | Date |
  |---|--------------|-----------|-------------|------|

Artifact count: {N}

If no artifacts found: "No signal artifacts exist yet for {topic}. Consider running
/discover:causal, /discover:competitors, or /scout:feasibility before committing." Stop.

=== READINESS SUMMARY ===

[Write this section last -- place it first in the final artifact.]

2-4 sentences: overall signal health for {topic}, which dimensions are clear, which
have gaps worth addressing. If recommending an action, name the skill using
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2). Frame as pilot briefing -- not a verdict. The team
decides.

Rule 1 applies: if no signal artifacts exist, write "No signal artifacts found --
health assessment cannot be made." Do not imply signal health when none was checked.

=== THE PREFLIGHT CHECK ===

Each item uses this structure:

  STATUS: OK | FLAG | OPEN
    OK = no issue
    FLAG = issue found, worth reviewing before committing
    OPEN = gap -- no artifact covers this area
  Basis: [name the specific artifacts examined -- with dates; "see above" does not pass;
    if no artifacts cover the area, write "no artifact covers [question]"]
  Finding: [specific named observation; OR required verbatim absence phrase -- Rule 1
    applies: use the exact required phrase, do not leave blank, do not hedge]
  Action: [required if STATUS is FLAG or OPEN; must use /namespace:skill format --
    Rule 2; omit only when STATUS is OK]

Work through all four items. Order is intentional: start with the causal question.

--- Item 1: CAUSAL GAP ---

What we're checking:
  Do you have evidence for why the feature causes the claimed outcome -- not just
  that it might, but how? This is the signal teams gather last, if ever. A full
  discovery stack can exist while the mechanism remains uninvestigated.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no mechanism evidence is found, write this exactly:
    "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal gap is open."
  Do not substitute, hedge, or leave the Finding blank. This exact wording is required.

What we found:

  Step 1: Name the claimed outcome for {topic}:
    "The claimed outcome is: [outcome]."
    If not stated in any artifact: "The claimed outcome is not named in any artifact --
    this is itself a gap."

  Step 2: Define mechanism evidence -- a causal chain of observable intermediate steps
  from feature to outcome. Not:
    - A correlation ("users who use X have better Y scores")
    - An outcome claim ("users will benefit")
    - A proxy metric ("adoption rate will increase")
  Is: "Feature causes outcome because [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."

  Step 3: Scan every artifact. State one of:
    (a) "Mechanism evidence found: [artifact, date] establishes [mechanism] by tracing
        [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."
    (b) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal
        gap is open."
  Rule 1: form (b) is required when no mechanism evidence exists. Do not leave blank.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifacts checked for mechanism content; if none: "no artifact addresses
    mechanism -- inventory checked: {artifact names}"]
  Finding: [(a) or required absence phrase (b) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: "Run /discover:causal to establish mechanism evidence
    before committing." Rule 2: /discover:causal, not "discover-causal".]

--- Item 2: SEQUENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Did discovery happen before specification? Commitment tends to close off
  investigation. Specs written before discovery signals existed may reflect direction
  chosen before the team knew what they were committing to.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no discovery artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering cannot be established."
  Do not write SEQUENCE OK when no discovery artifacts were checked.

What we found:
  Classify each artifact as discovery (discover, scout, prove, research, listen) or
  commitment (draft, topic, program). Note the date of each.

  Compare dates. State one of:
    (a) "Discovery precedes commitment: [discovery artifact, date] predates [commitment
        artifact, date]."
    (b) "Commitment precedes discovery: [commitment artifact, date] predates [discovery
        artifact, date]. Inversion flagged."
    (c) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering
        cannot be established."
  Rule 1: form (c) is required when no discovery artifacts exist.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifact names and dates compared; if no discovery artifacts: "no discovery
    artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [(a), (b), or required absence phrase (c) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the missing discovery signal and skill using
    /namespace:skill format -- Rule 2]

--- Item 3: STALENESS ---

What we're checking:
  Are your signals fresh enough to act on? Domain velocity determines freshness.
  Fast-moving market: a 30-day-old competitive signal may be unreliable. Stable
  enterprise cycle: a 90-day-old signal may hold. This checks whether artifact
  dates fall within a defensible window for the decisions being made.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no dated artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."
  Do not apply a threshold to an empty inventory without noting the absence.

What we found:
  First, name the threshold:
    "For {topic}'s domain: signals older than [N] days are stale because [reason]."

  Apply to each artifact. State which are within threshold and which are past it.
  Rule 1: if no dated artifacts, write the required absence phrase above.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [each artifact with date; or "no dated artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [fresh/stale breakdown by name; OR required absence phrase:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the stale artifact, its age vs. threshold, and the
    skill to refresh it -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

--- Item 4: COHERENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Do your signals tell a consistent story? When two signals address the same question,
  they should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be visible and deliberate.
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What we found:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

This matters because addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with one action.
Look especially for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase -- one root,
    two symptoms. Action: /discover:causal addresses both.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: spec preceded discovery; mechanism gap is
    downstream of the same premature commitment.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: stale signal is source of contradiction.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."

=== ARTIFACT ===

Write to simulations/signal/check/{topic}-check-{date}.md.

Frontmatter:
  topic: {topic}
  date: {date}
  causal_gap_status: ok | flag | open
  sequence_status: ok | flag | open
  staleness_status: ok | flag | open
  coherence_status: ok | flag | open

## Design Notes

**Why V-01 fails C-21:** The ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE declares three rules as a coordinated
stack with interdependency ("satisfying any two does not cover the failure addressed by the
third; no rule substitutes for another") -- this satisfies C-19. But C-21 requires each rule
to be "assigned to a named failure class." V-01's note says the rules "address independent
failure modes" without labeling what each failure mode is per rule. A reviewer classifying a
violation cannot map it to a rule by failure-mode name; they must read the full rule body.
The generic "independent failure modes" language satisfies the interdependency requirement
(C-19) but not the diagnostic taxonomy requirement (C-21).

**Why V-02 fails C-20:** Rule 3 in V-02 reads "Applies to: Rule 1, Rule 2." This satisfies
C-16 (Rule 3 enumerates the locations it governs -- namely, Rule 1 and Rule 2 declarations).
But C-20 requires the location-enumeration requirement to be expressed as a named meta-rule
that self-applies to all rule declarations including itself. In V-02, Rule 3 applies to the
two named existing rules only. It does not apply to itself (Rule 3's own "Applies to:" line
is not within Rule 3's stated scope), and it does not apply to hypothetical future rules.
Adding a Rule 4 to V-02's STANDING RULES would not automatically require Rule 4 to carry
an "Applies to:" line -- Rule 3 would need to be manually extended. This is the
forward-compatibility gap C-20 closes.

**Why V-03 fails both:** V-03 is the intersection of V-01's Rule 3 degradation and V-01's
ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE degradation. Rule 3 applies to Rule 1 and Rule 2 only (C-20 FAIL);
the stack note declares interdependency without failure-class labels (C-21 FAIL). Both failure
modes are present simultaneously. V-03 establishes the joint-absence baseline and confirms
that V-01 and V-02 each score above V-03 by exactly one criterion (no overlap between C-20
and C-21 failure conditions).

**What V-05 adds over V-04:** Two phrasing variants for the same structural properties.
Rule 3 replaces "CONSTRAINTS ARE LOCATION-COMPLETE" with "RULE DECLARATIONS ARE
SELF-SCOPING" and changes "Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block"
to "Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block, including Rule 3 itself
and any rule added in the future." The ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE replaces "absence drift /
reference ambiguity / constraint scope gaps" with "omission failure / resolution failure /
scope inheritance failure." V-05 tests whether C-20 and C-21 are property-level criteria
(any phrasing achieving the property passes) or vocabulary-specific (R4 V-05 terms required).
Expected: both pass, confirming property-level semantics. If the alternative vocabulary
fails C-21, a phrasing-agnosticism declaration (analogous to C-59 in the 2026-03-17 series)
would be warranted for R6.
