## R16 Variations Summary

| Var | C-43 | C-44 | C-45 | Est. Asp. | Est. Composite |
|-----|------|------|------|-----------|----------------|
| V-01 | PASS | **FAIL** | **FAIL** | 35/37 | 99.46 |
| V-02 | PASS | **FAIL (boundary)** | **FAIL** | 35/37 | 99.46 |
| V-03 | PASS | **PASS** | **FAIL** | 36/37 | 99.73 |
| V-04 | PASS | **FAIL** | **PASS** | 36/37 | 99.73 |
| V-05 | PASS | **PASS** | **PASS** | 37/37 | 100.00 |

**Single-axis design.** Only the STANDING RULES block differs. Two axes, three single-axis variations, two combined.

**C-44 axis** (V-01 through V-03):

| Var | Directory footer | Hypothesis |
|-----|-----------------|------------|
| V-01 | `All reader roles for this block are listed above.` | Unqualified: C-43 PASS, C-44 FAIL (regression) |
| V-02 | `All reader roles for this block are listed above. (3 reader roles)` | Count as suffix outside proposition: C-43 PASS, C-44 FAIL (boundary) |
| V-03 | `All 3 reader roles for this block are listed above.` | Count nested as qualifier: C-43 PASS, C-44 PASS |

**C-45 axis** (V-04 single-axis, V-05 combined):

| Var | NOTE attribution | Hypothesis |
|-----|-----------------|------------|
| V-04 | `...heading above (Rule 1 -- Absence Drift; Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity; Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps)` | C-44 FAIL, C-45 PASS -- confirms independence |
| V-05 | Same parenthetical index + `All 3 reader roles...` directory | C-44 PASS, C-45 PASS -- R16 ceiling |

**Key design decisions:**

- **V-02 boundary** is the key new discriminator: count-as-suffix (`...above. (3 reader roles)`) has the count present and arithmetic cross-checking available, but the count is not "nested within the proposition as a qualifier" -- it annotates the sentence rather than qualifying the subject noun. C-43 PASS because the proposition stands unqualified; C-44 FAIL because the nesting contract is not met.

- **V-03 vs V-04 orthogonality proof**: V-03 has C-44 PASS / C-45 FAIL; V-04 has C-44 FAIL / C-45 PASS. The two criteria are confirmed independently testable.

- **V-05 live R17 axis**: both structures carry the count 3 (directory: "All 3 reader roles..."; NOTE: three entries in the parenthetical). These are structurally independent but numerically consistent -- a potential C-46 would require the NOTE parenthetical entry count to match the STANDING RULES rule count, making the consistency checkable from the two structures alone.
ifier of the noun phrase before
  the verb; "(3 reader roles)" as a suffix annotation is outside the proposition. The
  suffix form is neither the assertion mechanism (C-42 form) nor a nested qualifier (C-44
  form). C-43 PASS; C-44 FAIL (count present but not nested as proposition qualifier).

- **V-03 isolates C-44**: "All 3 reader roles for this block are listed above." is the
  canonical count-qualified form extracted from R15 V-04. NOTE retains unextended general
  attribution ("failure class encoded in each rule's heading above"), so C-45 FAIL. The
  sole axis change from V-01 is the directory footer.

- **V-04 isolates C-45**: Confirms C-44 and C-45 are independently testable. Uses the
  unqualified all-roles claim (C-44 FAIL) but carries the full parenthetical heading
  index in the NOTE (C-45 PASS). A reader scanning V-04 will see C-45 satisfied without
  C-44, and V-03 with C-44 satisfied without C-45, establishing the two criteria as
  orthogonal.

- **V-05 as R16 ceiling**: Both C-44 and C-45 satisfied. Live R17 axis: the NOTE carries
  three entries in the parenthetical "(Rule 1 -- Absence Drift; Rule 2 -- Reference
  Ambiguity; Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps)" and the directory footer carries the count
  "All 3 reader roles..." -- these two counts (3 rules in NOTE index, 3 roles in directory)
  are structurally independent but numerically consistent. Does this cross-count consistency
  warrant a C-46 requiring that the NOTE's parenthetical entry count match the rule count
  declared in the STANDING RULES block, making the consistency checkable without reading
  the rule bodies? R16 scores V-05 at 37/37; the consistency property is the live R17
  extraction candidate.

---

## V-01: C-44 FAIL, C-45 FAIL -- R15 regression baseline (35/37)

**Variation axis**: Both new R16 axes at baseline failure
**Hypothesis**: A STANDING RULES block using the R15 V-03 unqualified all-roles claim
("All reader roles for this block are listed above.") and the R15 V-03 general NOTE
attribution ("failure class encoded in each rule's heading above"). Under the v16 rubric,
the unqualified all-roles claim satisfies C-43 (propositional form, no arithmetic required)
but fails C-44: no count is embedded in the proposition, so the arithmetic cross-check
path is absent. The general NOTE attribution satisfies C-41 (ownership transferred to
headings) but fails C-45: the attribution names the heading set without naming which
heading owns which failure class. Both C-44 and C-45 fail on the same variation to
establish the joint regression baseline. Est. asp. 35/37, composite 99.46.
Confirms R15's ceiling (35/37) under v16 is not a ceiling -- both new criteria require
structural additions absent from R15 V-03.

```
You are running /signal:check for topic: {topic}.

Think of this as a preflight check. The checklist does not decide whether to fly --
it makes sure the pilot sees everything before they decide. Nothing here blocks you
from proceeding. It exists so you know what you know before you commit.

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

Consulting Directory:
  committing engineers: Rule 1 -- Absence Drift (checking for undeclared absences
    before commit)
  skill-reference consumers: Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity (resolving skill name
    references in output)
  committing engineers and reviewers: Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps (scope-gap
    enforcement before and after commit)
  All reader roles for this block are listed above.

  Rule 1 -- Absence Drift -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the
    absence explicitly using the required verbatim phrases specified at each dimension.
    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    A committing engineer checking for missing absence declarations consults this
    rule to determine which Finding locations require verbatim phrases when no
    evidence exists. Silence in any governed location constitutes absence drift.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    A skill-reference consumer disambiguating a reference consults this rule to
    determine whether a skill name in the output can be resolved to a runnable skill.
    A bare name or imprecise format in any governed location constitutes reference
    ambiguity -- it cannot be resolved without guessing.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps -- RULES WITHOUT DECLARED SCOPE DO NOT EXIST:
    Obligation: every Rule in this STANDING RULES block must declare all output
    locations it governs. Scope must be discharged at rule-creation time, not
    retroactively.
    Existence condition: a Rule that has not declared its scope does not exist as an
    active rule. "Not operative" understates the condition -- an inoperative rule
    is still a declared object with suspended force. A rule without scope has no
    force, no scope, and no standing. It does not exist as an active rule.
    These two registers are not substitutes: the obligation tells a committing
    engineer reading for what to fix; the existence condition tells a reviewer
    reading for what is already lost.
    This requirement self-applies: Rule 3 itself declares its scope below.
    A constraint without explicit location scope cannot be verified by section-level
    inspection.
    Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block, including Rule 3
    itself and any rule added in the future.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each addresses an
  independent failure mode -- failure class encoded in each rule's heading above.
  No layer substitutes for another; the three rules address independent failure modes.
  All three must pass for the output to be a valid health report.

=== GATHER YOUR SIGNALS ===

Use Glob: simulations/**/*{topic}*.md

Build the inventory:

  | # | Artifact path | Namespace | Signal type | Date |
  |---|--------------|-----------|-------------|------|

Artifact count: {N}

If no artifacts found: "No signal artifacts exist yet for {topic}. Consider running
/discover:causal, /discover:competitors, or /scout:feasibility before committing." Stop.

=== READINESS SUMMARY ===

[Write this section last -- place it first in the final artifact.]

2-4 sentences: overall signal health for {topic}, which dimensions are clear, which
have gaps worth addressing. If recommending an action, name the skill using
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2). Frame as pilot briefing -- not a verdict. The team
decides.

Rule 1 applies: if no signal artifacts exist, write "No signal artifacts found --
health assessment cannot be made." Do not imply signal health when none was checked.

=== THE PREFLIGHT CHECK ===

Each item uses this structure:

  STATUS: OK | FLAG | OPEN
    OK = no issue
    FLAG = issue found, worth reviewing before committing
    OPEN = gap -- no artifact covers this area
  Basis: [name the specific artifacts examined -- with dates; "see above" does not pass;
    if no artifacts cover the area, write "no artifact covers [question]"]
  Finding: [specific named observation; OR required verbatim absence phrase -- Rule 1
    applies: use the exact required phrase, do not leave blank, do not hedge]
  Action: [required if STATUS is FLAG or OPEN; must use /namespace:skill format --
    Rule 2; omit only when STATUS is OK]

Work through all four items. Order is intentional: start with the causal question.

--- Item 1: CAUSAL GAP ---

What we're checking:
  Do you have evidence for why the feature causes the claimed outcome -- not just
  that it might, but how? This is the signal teams gather last, if ever. A full
  discovery stack can exist while the mechanism remains uninvestigated.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no mechanism evidence is found, write this exactly:
    "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal gap is open."
  Do not substitute, hedge, or leave the Finding blank. This exact wording is required.

What we found:

  Step 1: Name the claimed outcome for {topic}:
    "The claimed outcome is: [outcome]."
    If not stated in any artifact: "The claimed outcome is not named in any artifact --
    this is itself a gap."

  Step 2: Define mechanism evidence -- a causal chain of observable intermediate steps
  from feature to outcome. Not:
    - A correlation ("users who use X have better Y scores")
    - An outcome claim ("users will benefit")
    - A proxy metric ("adoption rate will increase")
  Is: "Feature causes outcome because [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."

  Step 3: Scan every artifact. State one of:
    (a) "Mechanism evidence found: [artifact, date] establishes [mechanism] by tracing
        [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."
    (b) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal
        gap is open."
  Rule 1: form (b) is required when no mechanism evidence exists. Do not leave blank.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifacts checked for mechanism content; if none: "no artifact addresses
    mechanism -- inventory checked: {artifact names}"]
  Finding: [(a) or required absence phrase (b) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: "Run /discover:causal to establish mechanism evidence
    before committing." Rule 2: /discover:causal, not "discover-causal".]

--- Item 2: SEQUENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Did discovery happen before specification? Commitment tends to close off
  investigation. Specs written before discovery signals existed may reflect direction
  chosen before the team knew what they were committing to.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no discovery artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering cannot be established."
  Do not write SEQUENCE OK when no discovery artifacts were checked.

What we found:
  Classify each artifact as discovery (discover, scout, prove, research, listen) or
  commitment (draft, topic, program). Note the date of each.

  Compare dates. State one of:
    (a) "Discovery precedes commitment: [discovery artifact, date] predates [commitment
        artifact, date]."
    (b) "Commitment precedes discovery: [commitment artifact, date] predates [discovery
        artifact, date]. Inversion flagged."
    (c) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering
        cannot be established."
  Rule 1: form (c) is required when no discovery artifacts exist.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifact names and dates compared; if no discovery artifacts: "no discovery
    artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [(a), (b), or required absence phrase (c) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the missing discovery signal and skill using
    /namespace:skill format -- Rule 2]

--- Item 3: STALENESS ---

What we're checking:
  Are your signals fresh enough to act on? Domain velocity determines freshness.
  Fast-moving market: a 30-day-old competitive signal may be unreliable. Stable
  enterprise cycle: a 90-day-old signal may hold. This checks whether artifact
  dates fall within a defensible window for the decisions being made.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no dated artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."
  Do not apply a threshold to an empty inventory without noting the absence.

What we found:
  First, name the threshold:
    "For {topic}'s domain: signals older than [N] days are stale because [reason]."

  Apply to each artifact. State which are within threshold and which are past it.
  Rule 1: if no dated artifacts, write the required absence phrase above.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [each artifact with date; or "no dated artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [fresh/stale breakdown by name; OR required absence phrase:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the stale artifact, its age vs. threshold, and the
    skill to refresh it -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

--- Item 4: COHERENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Do your signals tell a consistent story? When two signals address the same question,
  they should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be visible and deliberate.
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What we found:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

This matters because addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with one action.
Look especially for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase -- one root,
    two symptoms. Action: /discover:causal addresses both.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: spec preceded discovery; mechanism gap is
    downstream of the same premature commitment.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: stale signal is source of contradiction.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."

=== ARTIFACT ===

Write to simulations/signal/check/{topic}-check-{date}.md.

Frontmatter:
  topic: {topic}
  date: {date}
  causal_gap_status: ok | flag | open
  sequence_status: ok | flag | open
  staleness_status: ok | flag | open
  coherence_status: ok | flag | open
  staleness_threshold_named: true | false
  mechanism_evidence_found: true | false
  explicit_absences_declared: true | false
  skill_format_enforced: true
  cross_dimension_pattern: true | false
  missing_signals_by_skill: true | false
  verbatim_absence_phrases_used: true | false
  artifact_count: {count}
  open_dimensions: [{list of FLAG or OPEN dimension names}]
```

## V-02: C-44 FAIL (boundary) -- Count as suffix annotation outside proposition (35/37)

**Variation axis**: C-44 -- count present but outside the all-roles proposition
**Hypothesis**: A STANDING RULES block where the consulting directory carries a completeness
assertion in two parts: the unqualified all-roles claim ("All reader roles for this block
are listed above.") followed immediately by a suffix parenthetical annotating the count
("(3 reader roles)"). The count is present and matches the three directory entries, so
arithmetic cross-checking is available -- but only through inspection of the suffix
annotation, not through the proposition itself. C-43 PASS: the proposition "All reader
roles for this block are listed above." is an unqualified direct assertion requiring no
arithmetic. C-44 FAIL (boundary): C-44 requires the count to be "nested within the
proposition as a qualifier" -- "All 3 reader roles for this block are listed above" embeds
3 as a numeral qualifier of the noun phrase before the verb; "(3 reader roles)" as a
suffix appended after the sentence closes is outside the proposition. The count is present
and readable, but the nesting relationship is absent: the count annotates the assertion
rather than qualifying its subject noun. The NOTE retains general attribution. Est. asp.
35/37, composite 99.46.
Confirms that count proximity to the all-roles claim does not satisfy C-44 when the count
is not nested as a grammatical qualifier within the proposition's noun phrase.

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

Consulting Directory:
  committing engineers: Rule 1 -- Absence Drift (checking for undeclared absences
    before commit)
  skill-reference consumers: Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity (resolving skill name
    references in output)
  committing engineers and reviewers: Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps (scope-gap
    enforcement before and after commit)
  All reader roles for this block are listed above. (3 reader roles)

  Rule 1 -- Absence Drift -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the
    absence explicitly using the required verbatim phrases specified at each dimension.
    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    A committing engineer checking for missing absence declarations consults this
    rule to determine which Finding locations require verbatim phrases when no
    evidence exists. Silence in any governed location constitutes absence drift.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    A skill-reference consumer disambiguating a reference consults this rule to
    determine whether a skill name in the output can be resolved to a runnable skill.
    A bare name or imprecise format in any governed location constitutes reference
    ambiguity -- it cannot be resolved without guessing.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps -- RULES WITHOUT DECLARED SCOPE DO NOT EXIST:
    Obligation: every Rule in this STANDING RULES block must declare all output
    locations it governs. Scope must be discharged at rule-creation time, not
    retroactively.
    Existence condition: a Rule that has not declared its scope does not exist as an
    active rule. "Not operative" understates the condition -- an inoperative rule

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each addresses an

--- Item 3: STALENESS ---

What we're checking:
  Are your signals fresh enough to act on? Domain velocity determines freshness.
  Fast-moving market: a 30-day-old competitive signal may be unreliable. Stable
  enterprise cycle: a 90-day-old signal may hold. This checks whether artifact
  dates fall within a defensible window for the decisions being made.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no dated artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."
  Do not apply a threshold to an empty inventory without noting the absence.

What we found:
  First, name the threshold:
    "For {topic}'s domain: signals older than [N] days are stale because [reason]."

  Apply to each artifact. State which are within threshold and which are past it.
  Rule 1: if no dated artifacts, write the required absence phrase above.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [each artifact with date; or "no dated artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [fresh/stale breakdown by name; OR required absence phrase:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the stale artifact, its age vs. threshold, and the
    skill to refresh it -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

--- Item 4: COHERENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Do your signals tell a consistent story? When two signals address the same question,
  they should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be visible and deliberate.
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What we found:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

This matters because addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with one action.
Look especially for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase -- one root,
    two symptoms. Action: /discover:causal addresses both.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: spec preceded discovery; mechanism gap is
    downstream of the same premature commitment.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: stale signal is source of contradiction.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."

## V-03: C-44 PASS, C-45 FAIL -- Count-qualified all-roles claim; general NOTE attribution (36/37)

**Variation axis**: C-44 sole axis -- isolates C-44 as independently testable from C-45
**Hypothesis**: A STANDING RULES block where the consulting directory carries the canonical
count-qualified all-roles claim -- "All 3 reader roles for this block are listed above."
(the form extracted as R15 V-04's live axis, confirmed as C-44's canonical form). The count
"3" is nested as a numeral qualifier within the noun phrase "3 reader roles" inside the
proposition, so the proposition is both propositionally verifiable (accept or challenge
"All 3 reader roles...") and arithmetically cross-checkable (count the three directory
entries and compare to stated 3). C-43 PASS, C-44 PASS. The ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE retains
general attribution: "failure class encoded in each rule's heading above." -- C-41 PASS
(ownership attributed to headings as a set), C-45 FAIL (no parenthetical heading index
naming which specific heading owns each class). The sole axis change from V-01 is the
count qualifier in the directory footer; the NOTE is unchanged. Est. asp. 36/37,
composite 99.73.
Confirms C-44 is satisfied by the count-qualified form and independently testable from
C-45: a variation can pass C-44 while failing C-45.

```
You are running /signal:check for topic: {topic}.

Think of this as a preflight check. The checklist does not decide whether to fly --
it makes sure the pilot sees everything before they decide. Nothing here blocks you
from proceeding. It exists so you know what you know before you commit.

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

Consulting Directory:
  committing engineers: Rule 1 -- Absence Drift (checking for undeclared absences
    before commit)
  skill-reference consumers: Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity (resolving skill name
    references in output)
  committing engineers and reviewers: Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps (scope-gap
    enforcement before and after commit)
  All 3 reader roles for this block are listed above.

  Rule 1 -- Absence Drift -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the
    absence explicitly using the required verbatim phrases specified at each dimension.
    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    A committing engineer checking for missing absence declarations consults this
    rule to determine which Finding locations require verbatim phrases when no
    evidence exists. Silence in any governed location constitutes absence drift.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    A skill-reference consumer disambiguating a reference consults this rule to
    determine whether a skill name in the output can be resolved to a runnable skill.
    A bare name or imprecise format in any governed location constitutes reference
    ambiguity -- it cannot be resolved without guessing.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps -- RULES WITHOUT DECLARED SCOPE DO NOT EXIST:
    Obligation: every Rule in this STANDING RULES block must declare all output
    locations it governs. Scope must be discharged at rule-creation time, not
    retroactively.
    Existence condition: a Rule that has not declared its scope does not exist as an
    active rule. "Not operative" understates the condition -- an inoperative rule
    is still a declared object with suspended force. A rule without scope has no
    force, no scope, and no standing. It does not exist as an active rule.
    These two registers are not substitutes: the obligation tells a committing
    engineer reading for what to fix; the existence condition tells a reviewer
    reading for what is already lost.
    This requirement self-applies: Rule 3 itself declares its scope below.
    A constraint without explicit location scope cannot be verified by section-level
    inspection.
    Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block, including Rule 3
    itself and any rule added in the future.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each addresses an
  independent failure mode -- failure class encoded in each rule's heading above.
  No layer substitutes for another; the three rules address independent failure modes.
  All three must pass for the output to be a valid health report.

=== GATHER YOUR SIGNALS ===

Use Glob: simulations/**/*{topic}*.md

Build the inventory:

  | # | Artifact path | Namespace | Signal type | Date |
  |---|--------------|-----------|-------------|------|

Artifact count: {N}

If no artifacts found: "No signal artifacts exist yet for {topic}. Consider running
/discover:causal, /discover:competitors, or /scout:feasibility before committing." Stop.

=== READINESS SUMMARY ===

[Write this section last -- place it first in the final artifact.]

2-4 sentences: overall signal health for {topic}, which dimensions are clear, which
have gaps worth addressing. If recommending an action, name the skill using
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2). Frame as pilot briefing -- not a verdict. The team
decides.

Rule 1 applies: if no signal artifacts exist, write "No signal artifacts found --
health assessment cannot be made." Do not imply signal health when none was checked.

=== THE PREFLIGHT CHECK ===

Each item uses this structure:

  STATUS: OK | FLAG | OPEN
    OK = no issue
    FLAG = issue found, worth reviewing before committing
    OPEN = gap -- no artifact covers this area
  Basis: [name the specific artifacts examined -- with dates; "see above" does not pass;
    if no artifacts cover the area, write "no artifact covers [question]"]
  Finding: [specific named observation; OR required verbatim absence phrase -- Rule 1
    applies: use the exact required phrase, do not leave blank, do not hedge]
  Action: [required if STATUS is FLAG or OPEN; must use /namespace:skill format --
    Rule 2; omit only when STATUS is OK]

Work through all four items. Order is intentional: start with the causal question.

--- Item 1: CAUSAL GAP ---

What we're checking:
  Do you have evidence for why the feature causes the claimed outcome -- not just
  that it might, but how? This is the signal teams gather last, if ever. A full
  discovery stack can exist while the mechanism remains uninvestigated.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no mechanism evidence is found, write this exactly:
    "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal gap is open."
  Do not substitute, hedge, or leave the Finding blank. This exact wording is required.

What we found:

  Step 1: Name the claimed outcome for {topic}:
    "The claimed outcome is: [outcome]."
    If not stated in any artifact: "The claimed outcome is not named in any artifact --
    this is itself a gap."

  Step 2: Define mechanism evidence -- a causal chain of observable intermediate steps
  from feature to outcome. Not:
    - A correlation ("users who use X have better Y scores")
    - An outcome claim ("users will benefit")
    - A proxy metric ("adoption rate will increase")
  Is: "Feature causes outcome because [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."

  Step 3: Scan every artifact. State one of:
    (a) "Mechanism evidence found: [artifact, date] establishes [mechanism] by tracing
        [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."
    (b) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal
        gap is open."
  Rule 1: form (b) is required when no mechanism evidence exists. Do not leave blank.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifacts checked for mechanism content; if none: "no artifact addresses
    mechanism -- inventory checked: {artifact names}"]
  Finding: [(a) or required absence phrase (b) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: "Run /discover:causal to establish mechanism evidence
    before committing." Rule 2: /discover:causal, not "discover-causal".]

--- Item 2: SEQUENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Did discovery happen before specification? Commitment tends to close off
  investigation. Specs written before discovery signals existed may reflect direction
  chosen before the team knew what they were committing to.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no discovery artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering cannot be established."
  Do not write SEQUENCE OK when no discovery artifacts were checked.

What we found:
  Classify each artifact as discovery (discover, scout, prove, research, listen) or
  commitment (draft, topic, program). Note the date of each.

  Compare dates. State one of:
    (a) "Discovery precedes commitment: [discovery artifact, date] predates [commitment
        artifact, date]."
    (b) "Commitment precedes discovery: [commitment artifact, date] predates [discovery
        artifact, date]. Inversion flagged."
    (c) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering
        cannot be established."
  Rule 1: form (c) is required when no discovery artifacts exist.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifact names and dates compared; if no discovery artifacts: "no discovery
    artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [(a), (b), or required absence phrase (c) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the missing discovery signal and skill using
    /namespace:skill format -- Rule 2]

--- Item 3: STALENESS ---

What we're checking:
  Are your signals fresh enough to act on? Domain velocity determines freshness.
  Fast-moving market: a 30-day-old competitive signal may be unreliable. Stable
  enterprise cycle: a 90-day-old signal may hold. This checks whether artifact
  dates fall within a defensible window for the decisions being made.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no dated artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."
  Do not apply a threshold to an empty inventory without noting the absence.

What we found:
  First, name the threshold:
    "For {topic}'s domain: signals older than [N] days are stale because [reason]."

  Apply to each artifact. State which are within threshold and which are past it.
  Rule 1: if no dated artifacts, write the required absence phrase above.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [each artifact with date; or "no dated artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [fresh/stale breakdown by name; OR required absence phrase:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the stale artifact, its age vs. threshold, and the
    skill to refresh it -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

--- Item 4: COHERENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Do your signals tell a consistent story? When two signals address the same question,
  they should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be visible and deliberate.
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What we found:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

This matters because addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with one action.
Look especially for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase -- one root,
    two symptoms. Action: /discover:causal addresses both.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: spec preceded discovery; mechanism gap is
    downstream of the same premature commitment.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: stale signal is source of contradiction.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."

## V-04: C-44 FAIL, C-45 PASS -- Unqualified all-roles claim; parenthetical heading index (36/37)

**Variation axis**: C-45 sole axis -- confirms independent testability from C-44
**Hypothesis**: A STANDING RULES block where the consulting directory uses the unqualified
all-roles claim ("All reader roles for this block are listed above." -- C-43 PASS, C-44
FAIL: no count embedded as qualifier) while the ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE carries the full
parenthetical heading index embedded in the ownership attribution phrase (C-45 PASS). The
NOTE reads: "failure class encoded in each rule's heading above (Rule 1 -- Absence Drift;
Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity; Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps)." A reader scanning only
the NOTE can navigate directly to the heading for any failure class without scanning all
top-level headings -- the parenthetical is an extension of the attribution pointer, not
independent explanatory prose, so C-39's pure-interdependency constraint is preserved.
C-41 PASS (ownership attributed to headings), C-45 PASS (parenthetical heading index
embedded in attribution phrase, heading-index content only -- rule number plus class label,
no function prose). The directory footer is unchanged from V-01. Est. asp. 36/37,
composite 99.73.
Confirms C-44 and C-45 are independently testable: V-03 passes C-44 and fails C-45;
V-04 passes C-45 and fails C-44. Neither implies the other.

  Rule 1 -- Absence Drift -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each addresses an
  independent failure mode -- failure class encoded in each rule's heading above
  (Rule 1 -- Absence Drift; Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity; Rule 3 -- Constraint

    (a) "Discovery precedes commitment: [discovery artifact, date] predates [commitment
        artifact, date]."
    (b) "Commitment precedes discovery: [commitment artifact, date] predates [discovery
        artifact, date]. Inversion flagged."
    (c) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering
        cannot be established."
  Rule 1: form (c) is required when no discovery artifacts exist.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifact names and dates compared; if no discovery artifacts: "no discovery
    artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [(a), (b), or required absence phrase (c) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the missing discovery signal and skill using
    /namespace:skill format -- Rule 2]

--- Item 3: STALENESS ---

What we're checking:
  Are your signals fresh enough to act on? Domain velocity determines freshness.
  Fast-moving market: a 30-day-old competitive signal may be unreliable. Stable
  enterprise cycle: a 90-day-old signal may hold. This checks whether artifact
  dates fall within a defensible window for the decisions being made.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no dated artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."
  Do not apply a threshold to an empty inventory without noting the absence.

What we found:
  First, name the threshold:
    "For {topic}'s domain: signals older than [N] days are stale because [reason]."

  Apply to each artifact. State which are within threshold and which are past it.
  Rule 1: if no dated artifacts, write the required absence phrase above.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [each artifact with date; or "no dated artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [fresh/stale breakdown by name; OR required absence phrase:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the stale artifact, its age vs. threshold, and the
    skill to refresh it -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

--- Item 4: COHERENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Do your signals tell a consistent story? When two signals address the same question,
  they should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be visible and deliberate.
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What we found:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

This matters because addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with one action.
Look especially for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase -- one root,
    two symptoms. Action: /discover:causal addresses both.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: spec preceded discovery; mechanism gap is
    downstream of the same premature commitment.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: stale signal is source of contradiction.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."

## V-05: C-44 PASS, C-45 PASS -- Full R16 ceiling (37/37)

**Variation axis**: Combined C-44 + C-45 -- R16 ceiling form
**Hypothesis**: A STANDING RULES block combining the count-qualified all-roles claim
("All 3 reader roles for this block are listed above." -- C-44 PASS) with the full
parenthetical heading index in the NOTE attribution phrase (C-45 PASS). The consulting
directory footer embeds the count "3" as a numeral qualifier within the all-roles
proposition, satisfying C-44's requirement that the count is nested as a qualifier rather
than serving as assertion mechanism or suffix annotation. The ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE
attribution phrase carries the parenthetical heading index "(Rule 1 -- Absence Drift;
Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity; Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps)" embedded as an extension
of "failure class encoded in each rule's heading above" -- heading-index content only (rule
number plus class label, no function prose), preserving C-39's pure-interdependency form
while eliminating the heading-scan step for a reader navigating from the NOTE. C-43 PASS,
C-44 PASS, C-41 PASS, C-45 PASS. Est. asp. 37/37, composite 100.00.
Live R17 axis: the NOTE's parenthetical carries three entries (one per rule) and the
directory footer states "All 3 reader roles..." -- both structures embed the count 3.
These two counts are structurally independent (one governs rule taxonomy, one governs
role coverage) but numerically consistent. A potential C-46 would require that the NOTE
parenthetical entry count match the rule count in the STANDING RULES block, making the
consistency between the two counts checkable from the two structures without reading any
rule body. R16 scores V-05 at 37/37; the count-consistency property is the candidate for
R17 extraction.

```
You are running /signal:check for topic: {topic}.

Think of this as a preflight check. The checklist does not decide whether to fly --
it makes sure the pilot sees everything before they decide. Nothing here blocks you
from proceeding. It exists so you know what you know before you commit.

STANDING RULES

The following rules apply to every section of this output, without exception.
Violations in any section fail the output, not just the section.

Consulting Directory:
  committing engineers: Rule 1 -- Absence Drift (checking for undeclared absences
    before commit)
  skill-reference consumers: Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity (resolving skill name
    references in output)
  committing engineers and reviewers: Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps (scope-gap
    enforcement before and after commit)
  All 3 reader roles for this block are listed above.

  Rule 1 -- Absence Drift -- ABSENCE MUST BE DECLARED:
    For every dimension where relevant evidence is absent or unavailable, write the
    absence explicitly using the required verbatim phrases specified at each dimension.
    Do not leave a Finding field blank. Do not hedge. Do not write a finding that
    implies evidence was reviewed and found clear when no evidence was found.
    Silence does not pass.
    A committing engineer checking for missing absence declarations consults this
    rule to determine which Finding locations require verbatim phrases when no
    evidence exists. Silence in any governed location constitutes absence drift.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP Finding, SEQUENCE Finding, STALENESS
    Finding, COHERENCE Finding, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Blank or hedged findings in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity -- SKILL REFERENCE FORMAT:
    Every skill reference in this output uses /namespace:skill format.
    Correct: /discover:causal, /discover:competitors, /scout:feasibility, /prove:hypothesis
    Wrong: "discover-causal", "run a discover skill", "/discover"
    A skill-reference consumer disambiguating a reference consults this rule to
    determine whether a skill name in the output can be resolved to a runnable skill.
    A bare name or imprecise format in any governed location constitutes reference
    ambiguity -- it cannot be resolved without guessing.
    Applies to: readiness summary, CAUSAL GAP action, SEQUENCE action, STALENESS
    action, COHERENCE action, cross-item patterns, and MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE.
    Bare skill names in any of those locations do not pass.

  Rule 3 -- Constraint Scope Gaps -- RULES WITHOUT DECLARED SCOPE DO NOT EXIST:
    Obligation: every Rule in this STANDING RULES block must declare all output
    locations it governs. Scope must be discharged at rule-creation time, not
    retroactively.
    Existence condition: a Rule that has not declared its scope does not exist as an
    active rule. "Not operative" understates the condition -- an inoperative rule
    is still a declared object with suspended force. A rule without scope has no
    force, no scope, and no standing. It does not exist as an active rule.
    These two registers are not substitutes: the obligation tells a committing
    engineer reading for what to fix; the existence condition tells a reviewer
    reading for what is already lost.
    This requirement self-applies: Rule 3 itself declares its scope below.
    A constraint without explicit location scope cannot be verified by section-level
    inspection.
    Applies to: all Rule declarations in this STANDING RULES block, including Rule 3
    itself and any rule added in the future.

ENFORCEMENT STACK NOTE:
  Rules 1, 2, and 3 form a coordinated enforcement stack. Each addresses an
  independent failure mode -- failure class encoded in each rule's heading above
  (Rule 1 -- Absence Drift; Rule 2 -- Reference Ambiguity; Rule 3 -- Constraint
  Scope Gaps). No layer substitutes for another; the three rules address independent
  failure modes. All three must pass for the output to be a valid health report.

=== GATHER YOUR SIGNALS ===

Use Glob: simulations/**/*{topic}*.md

Build the inventory:

  | # | Artifact path | Namespace | Signal type | Date |
  |---|--------------|-----------|-------------|------|

Artifact count: {N}

If no artifacts found: "No signal artifacts exist yet for {topic}. Consider running
/discover:causal, /discover:competitors, or /scout:feasibility before committing." Stop.

=== READINESS SUMMARY ===

[Write this section last -- place it first in the final artifact.]

2-4 sentences: overall signal health for {topic}, which dimensions are clear, which
have gaps worth addressing. If recommending an action, name the skill using
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2). Frame as pilot briefing -- not a verdict. The team
decides.

Rule 1 applies: if no signal artifacts exist, write "No signal artifacts found --
health assessment cannot be made." Do not imply signal health when none was checked.

=== THE PREFLIGHT CHECK ===

Each item uses this structure:

  STATUS: OK | FLAG | OPEN
    OK = no issue
    FLAG = issue found, worth reviewing before committing
    OPEN = gap -- no artifact covers this area
  Basis: [name the specific artifacts examined -- with dates; "see above" does not pass;
    if no artifacts cover the area, write "no artifact covers [question]"]
  Finding: [specific named observation; OR required verbatim absence phrase -- Rule 1
    applies: use the exact required phrase, do not leave blank, do not hedge]
  Action: [required if STATUS is FLAG or OPEN; must use /namespace:skill format --
    Rule 2; omit only when STATUS is OK]

Work through all four items. Order is intentional: start with the causal question.

--- Item 1: CAUSAL GAP ---

What we're checking:
  Do you have evidence for why the feature causes the claimed outcome -- not just
  that it might, but how? This is the signal teams gather last, if ever. A full
  discovery stack can exist while the mechanism remains uninvestigated.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no mechanism evidence is found, write this exactly:
    "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal gap is open."
  Do not substitute, hedge, or leave the Finding blank. This exact wording is required.

What we found:

  Step 1: Name the claimed outcome for {topic}:
    "The claimed outcome is: [outcome]."
    If not stated in any artifact: "The claimed outcome is not named in any artifact --
    this is itself a gap."

  Step 2: Define mechanism evidence -- a causal chain of observable intermediate steps
  from feature to outcome. Not:
    - A correlation ("users who use X have better Y scores")
    - An outcome claim ("users will benefit")
    - A proxy metric ("adoption rate will increase")
  Is: "Feature causes outcome because [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."

  Step 3: Scan every artifact. State one of:
    (a) "Mechanism evidence found: [artifact, date] establishes [mechanism] by tracing
        [step 1] -> [step 2] -> [step 3]."
    (b) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No mechanism evidence found -- the causal
        gap is open."
  Rule 1: form (b) is required when no mechanism evidence exists. Do not leave blank.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifacts checked for mechanism content; if none: "no artifact addresses
    mechanism -- inventory checked: {artifact names}"]
  Finding: [(a) or required absence phrase (b) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: "Run /discover:causal to establish mechanism evidence
    before committing." Rule 2: /discover:causal, not "discover-causal".]

--- Item 2: SEQUENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Did discovery happen before specification? Commitment tends to close off
  investigation. Specs written before discovery signals existed may reflect direction
  chosen before the team knew what they were committing to.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no discovery artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering cannot be established."
  Do not write SEQUENCE OK when no discovery artifacts were checked.

What we found:
  Classify each artifact as discovery (discover, scout, prove, research, listen) or
  commitment (draft, topic, program). Note the date of each.

  Compare dates. State one of:
    (a) "Discovery precedes commitment: [discovery artifact, date] predates [commitment
        artifact, date]."
    (b) "Commitment precedes discovery: [commitment artifact, date] predates [discovery
        artifact, date]. Inversion flagged."
    (c) Required verbatim absence phrase: "No discovery artifacts found -- ordering
        cannot be established."
  Rule 1: form (c) is required when no discovery artifacts exist.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [artifact names and dates compared; if no discovery artifacts: "no discovery
    artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [(a), (b), or required absence phrase (c) -- required]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the missing discovery signal and skill using
    /namespace:skill format -- Rule 2]

--- Item 3: STALENESS ---

What we're checking:
  Are your signals fresh enough to act on? Domain velocity determines freshness.
  Fast-moving market: a 30-day-old competitive signal may be unreliable. Stable
  enterprise cycle: a 90-day-old signal may hold. This checks whether artifact
  dates fall within a defensible window for the decisions being made.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When no dated artifacts exist, write this exactly:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."
  Do not apply a threshold to an empty inventory without noting the absence.

What we found:
  First, name the threshold:
    "For {topic}'s domain: signals older than [N] days are stale because [reason]."

  Apply to each artifact. State which are within threshold and which are past it.
  Rule 1: if no dated artifacts, write the required absence phrase above.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [each artifact with date; or "no dated artifacts in inventory"]
  Finding: [fresh/stale breakdown by name; OR required absence phrase:
    "No dated artifacts found -- staleness cannot be assessed."]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: name the stale artifact, its age vs. threshold, and the
    skill to refresh it -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

--- Item 4: COHERENCE ---

What we're checking:
  Do your signals tell a consistent story? When two signals address the same question,
  they should roughly agree -- or the disagreement should be visible and deliberate.
  Hidden contradictions surface after commitment.

Required verbatim absence phrase for this item:
  When only one artifact exists, write this exactly:
    "Only one artifact exists for {topic} -- no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Do not write COHERENCE OK when there was nothing to compare.

What we found:
  Find at least one pair of artifacts addressing the same question. State what each says.

  Name a specific agreement or contradiction:
    Agreement: "[Artifact A, date] and [Artifact B, date] both say [X]."
    Contradiction: "[Artifact A, date] says [X]. [Artifact B, date] says [Y].
      These disagree on [question]."
    Required absence phrase when no pair: "Only one artifact exists for {topic} --
      no comparable pair available to assess coherence."
  Rule 1: absence phrase is required when no pair exists.

  STATUS: [OK / FLAG / OPEN]
  Basis: [pairs examined; or "single artifact -- no comparable pair"]
  Finding: [named agreement, contradiction, or required absence phrase -- Rule 1 applies]

What you can do:
  Action: [if FLAG or OPEN: what resolves the contradiction or provides a second
    artifact -- /namespace:skill format required -- Rule 2]

=== CROSS-ITEM PATTERNS ===

Step back from the four items. Do two or more share a common root cause?

This matters because addressing a shared root closes multiple gaps with one action.
Look especially for:
  - CAUSAL GAP OPEN + SEQUENCE OPEN/FLAG: one missing discovery phase -- one root,
    two symptoms. Action: /discover:causal addresses both.
  - SEQUENCE FLAG + CAUSAL GAP OPEN: spec preceded discovery; mechanism gap is
    downstream of the same premature commitment.
  - STALENESS FLAG + COHERENCE FLAG: stale signal is source of contradiction.

Rule 2 applies here: all skill references use /namespace:skill format.
Rule 1 applies here: if no pattern exists, write "No cross-item pattern found."
Do not leave this section blank.

If a pattern exists: name it, name which items it explains, name the single action
addressing the root -- using /namespace:skill format.

=== MISSING SIGNAL GUIDE ===

For every item with STATUS FLAG or OPEN, one line per gap. All skill references use
/namespace:skill format (Rule 2 -- applies to every line in this section):

  [Dimension] gap: run /[namespace]:[skill] -- produces [what it creates]

Examples:
  CAUSAL GAP open: run /discover:causal -- produces mechanism evidence for the causal chain
  SEQUENCE open: run /discover:competitors -- produces dated discovery artifact to establish order
  STALENESS flag: run /discover:competitors -- refreshes competitive landscape signal
  COHERENCE open: run /scout:feasibility -- produces second feasibility signal for comparison

Rule 1 applies to this section: if a gap is present and no skill is identified, write
"no skill identified for [dimension] -- manual investigation required." Do not leave
a gap line blank.

If no items are FLAG or OPEN: "No missing signals -- signal health is clear."
