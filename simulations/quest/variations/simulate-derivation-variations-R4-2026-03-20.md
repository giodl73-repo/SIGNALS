## R4 Variations Summary

**Base**: V-05-R3 (127/145 under v4 -- Proficient)

**Four R4 gaps closed:**

| Variation | Axis | Target | Pts recovered |
|-----------|------|--------|---------------|
| V-01 | EXACT/PHYSICAL justification names required in type definitions | C-08 | +3 |
| V-02 | "SOUND BLOCKED" gate replaces advisory "before recording your verdict" | C-17 | +5 |
| V-03 | Explicit "P1 first, then P2, then P3" ordering replaces conditional priority rule | C-19 | +5 |
| V-04 | V-01 + V-03 (Phase 1 + Phase 4 only) | C-08 + C-19 | +8 |
| V-05 | All four: V-01 + V-02 + V-03 + C-18 axis-C relabeled to "NEW-tagged fault detection" | C-08 + C-17 + C-18 + C-19 | +18 |

**Expected ceiling with V-05**: 142-145 (Exemplary). V-04 is the fallback at 135/145 if V-02's SOUND-BLOCKED phrasing over-expands APPROX blocks.

**Where each change lives in the prompt:**
- V-01: Phase 1 type definitions (two sentences, one per type)
- V-02: Inside the `APPROX check` code block template -- the "If NO" line
- V-03: Phase 4 Amend preamble -- one paragraph replaced
- C-18 tightening: Gateway table axis C label + gate wording ("all present axes" vs "all three")

No structural conflicts. All four stack cleanly.
ed to EXACT, one to PHYSICAL)
- V-02 changes only the APPROX "If NO" clause inside the Phase 2 block template
- V-03 changes only the Amend priority rule in Phase 4
- None of the three touch the same prompt location -- stacking is clean
- C-18 is structurally present in the base (gateway table exists, gate wording is correct); V-05 tightens axis C label from "Source acknowledgment gate" to "NEW-tagged fault detection" to align with rubric language
- V-05 is the ceiling test; V-04 is the safer combined bet if V-02's SOUND-BLOCKED phrasing triggers over-caution on APPROX steps

**Expected R4 ceiling with V-05**: 142-145 if the LLM sustains all four axes without truncating Phase 2 or compressing the expansion pass.

**Why each change is non-obvious:**

**The C-08 justification gap (V-01):** V-05-R3 lists EXACT as "exact algebraic identity" and PHYSICAL as "physical assumption encoded algebraically" in the type menu, but never instructs the LLM to name which identity or assumption in the Justification cell. The LLM can label a step EXACT and write "algebra holds" without citing the product rule, distributivity, or the specific equation substituted. C-08 requires spot-checkable traceable justifications. V-01 closes this by adding the naming requirement directly in the type definitions -- exactly where the LLM reads the constraint while filling the table.

**The SOUND-blocking gap (V-02):** V-05-R3's "If NO: replace (b) with a domain-principle-grounded statement before recording your verdict" is imperative -- not advisory. But the C-17 rubric requires the SOUND-blocking to be stated explicitly: "the tracer cannot record a SOUND verdict on an APPROX block while (b) remains a paraphrase." V-05-R3 implies this chain (replace before recording) but does not name the consequence. An LLM that replaces (b) with a still-paraphrase-adjacent statement has no explicit stop signal. V-02 adds "SOUND BLOCKED" as a labeled gate -- the LLM must acknowledge the block before attempting the verdict line.

**The ordering rule gap (V-03):** V-05-R3's priority rule says "if P1 faults exist, first fix must address P1; if no P1 but P2 exist, at least one fix must address P2." This covers P1-first but does not state P2-before-P3 as an ordering rule -- it requires "at least one P2 fix" to exist, not that all P2 fixes precede all P3 fixes. C-19 requires the explicit form "order fixes by severity: P1 first, then P2, then P3." V-03 replaces the conditional priority rule with an unconditional ordering statement that names all three tiers.

**V-05 is the ceiling test:** All four changes are structurally isolated: V-01 is Phase 1 type definitions, V-02 is inside the Phase 2 APPROX template code block, V-03 is the Phase 4 Amend preamble, and C-18 tightening is the gateway table axis C label. Risk: V-02's SOUND BLOCKED gate could trigger over-caution, expanding APPROX blocks and causing Phase 2 truncation. V-04 is the fallback -- it picks up C-08 (+3 pts) and C-19 (+5 pts) without the APPROX gate change.

---

## V-01 -- EXACT/PHYSICAL Justification Requirements

**Axis**: Step type justification depth
**Hypothesis**: C-08 fails because the Phase 1 type definitions tell the LLM what the step types mean but not what the Justification cell must contain. EXACT says "exact algebraic identity" without requiring the LLM to name which identity. PHYSICAL says "physical assumption encoded algebraically" without requiring the LLM to name which assumption. Adding one sentence to each type definition -- exactly where the LLM reads the constraint while filling the table -- forces spot-checkable traceable justifications without changing any other phase.

You are running /simulate-derivation for: {{topic}}

Trace a mathematical derivation step by step -- the algebraic manipulation, not the logical argument. Catch sign errors, missing terms, unjustified approximations, dimensional inconsistencies.

**Before you begin**: read the paper for {{topic}}. If simulate-argument or discover-limiting-cases artifacts exist, read those. Identify the starting expression, the endpoint, and any approximations the paper names. That is all the acquisition you need.

---

## PHASE 1 -- DERIVATION MAP

Build the step table:

| S-ID | Starting expression | Operation applied | Resulting expression | Justification | Type |
|------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------|------|

Types:
- **EXACT**: exact algebraic identity -- the Justification cell must name the algebraic rule, identity, or substitution that makes this step exact (e.g., "product rule," "distributivity," "substitution of Eq. 3"). A step with an unexplained jump may not be labeled EXACT.
- **APPROX**: approximation made -- state what, under what conditions, whether paper names it
- **DEFINITION**: symbol introduced or substituted
- **PHYSICAL**: physical assumption encoded algebraically -- the Justification cell must state the physical assumption being encoded (e.g., "at equilibrium, dR/dt = 0," "incompressible flow," "quasi-static process")

Cover every non-trivial step. Minimum 3 rows.

---

## PHASE 1b -- STEP EXPANSION PASS

After completing the derivation map, scan each row for compressed steps -- any step where the paper jumps from one expression to a significantly different one without showing the intermediate algebra.

For each compressed step you identify:
- Insert sub-steps labeled S-NNa and S-NNb (or through S-NNc if more sub-steps are needed)
- The intermediate expression is the Resulting expression of S-NNa and the Starting expression of S-NNb
- Mark sub-step rows with "(interpolated)" in the Justification column -- this distinguishes your reconstruction from the paper's own steps

If no compressed steps exist, add: "No compressed steps identified -- C-10 auto-passes."

Interpolated sub-steps are verified in Phase 2 exactly like paper steps.

---

## PHASE 1b COMPLETION CHECK

Before proceeding to Phase 2, confirm that all three structural axes are active. Fill each Status cell with ACTIVE or ABSENT.

| Axis | Requirement | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| A -- Sub-step expansion | At least one interpolated sub-step inserted, OR "No compressed steps identified -- C-10 auto-passes" explicitly stated above | |
| B -- Prose reasoning | Prose-per-check rule (YES -- [sentence] / NO -- [sentence]) will apply to every check in every verification block in Phase 2 | |
| C -- Source acknowledgment | Source acknowledgment gate will execute for every WEAK or BROKEN step verdict in Phase 2 | |

All three must show ACTIVE before you proceed to Phase 2.
If any axis shows ABSENT: revisit Phase 1b (for Axis A) or reconfirm the Phase 2 rules (for Axes B and C).
Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until all three show ACTIVE.

---

## PHASE 2 -- STEP-BY-STEP VERIFICATION (primary output -- do not abbreviate)

For each step S-ID (including interpolated sub-steps from Phase 1b), produce a full verification block. This phase is the core deliverable of this skill -- allocate as much space as needed. Do not collapse multiple steps into one block. Do not omit a step because it looks trivial.

**Reasoning rule -- applies to all checks**: Do not write a bare YES or NO. Every verdict token must be followed by a dash and at least one sentence of reasoning. "YES -- [sentence]" or "NO -- [sentence]". A block containing only YES or NO tokens for any check fails the minimum standard.

**Density uniformity rule -- per step block**: Within any single step block, prose density must be uniform across the APPROX sub-block and the three primary checks (algebraic, dimensional, sign). If the APPROX sub-block contains at least one explanatory sentence, every primary check in that same block must also contain at least one explanatory sentence. The reverse also applies. Uniform means: sparse throughout the block, or rich throughout the block. Mixed density within a single step block -- rich APPROX prose alongside bare primary checks, or vice versa -- fails this rule.

```
S-[NN]: [description of what this step does] [(interpolated) if applicable]
From: [exact expression before the step]
Operation: [the specific algebraic or conceptual operation]
To: [exact expression after the step]

Algebraic correctness check:
  Does the algebra hold exactly?
  YES -- [identify the algebraic identity, rule, or substitution that makes this exact]
  NO -- [identify the exact error: wrong sign, missing term, wrong exponent, incorrect factoring]
  CONDITIONAL -- [state the condition that must hold and why the algebra fails outside it]

Dimensional consistency check:
  Are the units on LHS equal to units on RHS?
  YES -- [confirm which physical dimension appears on each side and how they match]
  NO -- [identify which side carries incorrect dimensions and which factor is responsible]
  NOT APPLICABLE -- [explain why dimensional analysis does not apply here]

Sign check:
  Does the sign of every term make physical or mathematical sense?
  YES -- [state the physical or mathematical principle that governs the expected sign]
  NO -- [identify the specific term, state the expected sign, and give the reasoning]

APPROX check (for APPROX-typed steps only -- skip for EXACT, DEFINITION, PHYSICAL):
  What quantity or relationship is being approximated?
    [state explicitly in the tracer's own words -- do not merely quote the paper]
  Under what conditions does this approximation hold?
    [name the domain regime, physical principle, or first-principles argument --
     e.g., "small-angle regime," "quasi-static assumption," "low Reynolds number."
     Do not paraphrase the source sentence; ground the statement in domain knowledge.]
  Source-removal test: if the source sentence describing this approximation were removed
    entirely, could you support your validity condition from domain knowledge alone?
    YES (independent) / NO (paraphrase)
    If NO: replace (b) with a domain-principle-grounded statement before recording your verdict.
  Does the source paper state this approximation by name or description? YES / NO
  Does the source paper give the validity condition? YES / NO

Step verdict: SOUND / WEAK / BROKEN
If WEAK or BROKEN: [exact description of the failure]

Source acknowledgment (complete only when verdict is WEAK or BROKEN):
  Does the source paper flag or acknowledge this specific issue anywhere --
  main text, footnotes, discussion section, or stated limitations? YES / NO
  If NO: this fault is a NEW finding -- the paper does not acknowledge it.
```

If the derivation contains zero APPROX-typed steps, add after all verification blocks:
> "APPROX check: no approximation steps found in this derivation. C-03 auto-passes."

---

## PHASE 3 -- DERIVATION FAULT REGISTER

| F-ID | S-ID | Verdict | Type | Description | Fix |
|------|------|---------|------|-------------|-----|

Severity:
- **P1** -- algebraically wrong
- **P2** -- approximation made but not stated (any WEAK/BROKEN from the APPROX check)
- **P3** -- correct but unclear, notational, or missing intermediate

Every WEAK or BROKEN verdict from Phase 2 must appear here. If no faults: write "No faults found." with a brief justification.

**NEW fault tagging**: For any fault where the source paper does not acknowledge the issue (as determined by your Phase 2 source acknowledgment check), append "NEW: not acknowledged by paper" to the Description column.

---

## PHASE 4 -- GLOBAL VERDICT AND AMEND

**Derivation Soundness Verdict** (required in a summary section -- do not bury in a step block):

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| SOUND | All steps verified; endpoint follows from starting point |
| CONDITIONALLY SOUND | All steps verified under stated approximations |
| BROKEN | At least one P1 error blocks the conclusion |

State which verdict applies and why in one to three sentences.

**Amend** -- exactly three targeted fixes, each citing an F-ID from Phase 3.

Priority rule: if P1 faults exist in the register, your first fix must address a P1 fault. If no P1 faults exist but P2 faults exist, at least one fix must address a P2 fault. Highest-severity issue leads the Amend section.

1. [F-ID] [P1/P2/P3]: [specific fix -- state the exact correction, not generic advice]
2. [F-ID] [P1/P2/P3]: [specific fix]
3. [F-ID] [P1/P2/P3]: [specific fix]

If fewer than three F-IDs exist, use remaining slots for P3 clarity improvements on steps that were SOUND but had minor issues worth addressing.

Write artifact to: signals/simulate/derivation/{{topic}}-derivation-{{date}}.md
If --output <path> provided: write flat into <path>/
Frontmatter: skill: simulate-derivation, topic: {{topic}}, date: {{date}}, steps_traced: [n], p1_errors: [n], unstated_approx: [n]

---

## V-02 -- SOUND-Blocking Gate

**Axis**: Mandatory recovery instruction -- explicit SOUND prohibition while (b) is paraphrase
**Hypothesis**: V-05-R3's "If NO: replace (b) with a domain-principle-grounded statement before recording your verdict" is imperative, not advisory, but it does not state the consequence of proceeding without replacing. An LLM that replaces (b) with a still-paraphrase-adjacent statement has no explicit stop signal -- it can record SOUND and continue. C-17 requires the recovery to be unconditional and the verdict prohibition to be named. Adding "SOUND BLOCKED for this step" as a labeled gate -- mirroring the language "SOUND may not be recorded while (b) remains paraphrase" -- makes the blocking consequence explicit at the generation moment. The LLM must acknowledge the block before it can proceed to the verdict line.

---

Trace a mathematical derivation step by step -- the algebraic manipulation, not the logical argument. Catch sign errors, missing terms, unjustified approximations, dimensional inconsistencies.

**Before you begin**: read the paper for {{topic}}. If simulate-argument or discover-limiting-cases artifacts exist, read those. Identify the starting expression, the endpoint, and any approximations the paper names. That is all the acquisition you need.

---

## PHASE 1 -- DERIVATION MAP

Build the step table:

| S-ID | Starting expression | Operation applied | Resulting expression | Justification | Type |
|------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------|------|

Types:
- **EXACT**: exact algebraic identity
- **APPROX**: approximation made -- state what, under what conditions, whether paper names it
- **DEFINITION**: symbol introduced or substituted
- **PHYSICAL**: physical assumption encoded algebraically

Cover every non-trivial step. Minimum 3 rows.

---

## PHASE 1b -- STEP EXPANSION PASS

After completing the derivation map, scan each row for compressed steps -- any step where the paper jumps from one expression to a significantly different one without showing the intermediate algebra.

For each compressed step you identify:
- Insert sub-steps labeled S-NNa and S-NNb (or through S-NNc if more sub-steps are needed)
- The intermediate expression is the Resulting expression of S-NNa and the Starting expression of S-NNb
- Mark sub-step rows with "(interpolated)" in the Justification column -- this distinguishes your reconstruction from the paper's own steps

If no compressed steps exist, add: "No compressed steps identified -- C-10 auto-passes."

Interpolated sub-steps are verified in Phase 2 exactly like paper steps.

---

## PHASE 1b COMPLETION CHECK

Before proceeding to Phase 2, confirm that all three structural axes are active. Fill each Status cell with ACTIVE or ABSENT.

| Axis | Requirement | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| A -- Sub-step expansion | At least one interpolated sub-step inserted, OR "No compressed steps identified -- C-10 auto-passes" explicitly stated above | |
| B -- Prose reasoning | Prose-per-check rule (YES -- [sentence] / NO -- [sentence]) will apply to every check in every verification block in Phase 2 | |
| C -- Source acknowledgment | Source acknowledgment gate will execute for every WEAK or BROKEN step verdict in Phase 2 | |

All three must show ACTIVE before you proceed to Phase 2.
If any axis shows ABSENT: revisit Phase 1b (for Axis A) or reconfirm the Phase 2 rules (for Axes B and C).
Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until all three show ACTIVE.

---

## PHASE 2 -- STEP-BY-STEP VERIFICATION (primary output -- do not abbreviate)

For each step S-ID (including interpolated sub-steps from Phase 1b), produce a full verification block. This phase is the core deliverable of this skill -- allocate as much space as needed. Do not collapse multiple steps into one block. Do not omit a step because it looks trivial.

**Reasoning rule -- applies to all checks**: Do not write a bare YES or NO. Every verdict token must be followed by a dash and at least one sentence of reasoning. "YES -- [sentence]" or "NO -- [sentence]". A block containing only YES or NO tokens for any check fails the minimum standard.

**Density uniformity rule -- per step block**: Within any single step block, prose density must be uniform across the APPROX sub-block and the three primary checks (algebraic, dimensional, sign). If the APPROX sub-block contains at least one explanatory sentence, every primary check in that same block must also contain at least one explanatory sentence. The reverse also applies. Uniform means: sparse throughout the block, or rich throughout the block. Mixed density within a single step block -- rich APPROX prose alongside bare primary checks, or vice versa -- fails this rule.

     Do not paraphrase the source sentence; ground the statement in domain knowledge.]
  Source-removal test: if the source sentence describing this approximation were removed
    entirely, could you support your validity condition from domain knowledge alone?
    YES (independent) / NO (paraphrase)
    If NO: SOUND BLOCKED for this step. You must replace (b) with a statement grounded
    in a named domain principle or first-principles argument before proceeding. A SOUND
    verdict may not be recorded for this APPROX block while (b) remains a paraphrase
    of the source. Correct (b) now, then continue to the step verdict line.
  Does the source paper state this approximation by name or description? YES / NO
  Does the source paper give the validity condition? YES / NO

Step verdict: SOUND / WEAK / BROKEN
If WEAK or BROKEN: [exact description of the failure]

Source acknowledgment (complete only when verdict is WEAK or BROKEN):
  Does the source paper flag or acknowledge this specific issue anywhere --
  main text, footnotes, discussion section, or stated limitations? YES / NO
  If NO: this fault is a NEW finding -- the paper does not acknowledge it.
```

If the derivation contains zero APPROX-typed steps, add after all verification blocks:
> "APPROX check: no approximation steps found in this derivation. C-03 auto-passes. C-17 auto-passes."

---

## PHASE 3 -- DERIVATION FAULT REGISTER

| F-ID | S-ID | Verdict | Type | Description | Fix |
|------|------|---------|------|-------------|-----|

Severity:
- **P1** -- algebraically wrong
- **P2** -- approximation made but not stated (any WEAK/BROKEN from the APPROX check)
- **P3** -- correct but unclear, notational, or missing intermediate

Every WEAK or BROKEN verdict from Phase 2 must appear here. If no faults: write "No faults found." with a brief justification.

**NEW fault tagging**: For any fault where the source paper does not acknowledge the issue (as determined by your Phase 2 source acknowledgment check), append "NEW: not acknowledged by paper" to the Description column.

---

## PHASE 4 -- GLOBAL VERDICT AND AMEND

**Derivation Soundness Verdict** (required in a summary section -- do not bury in a step block):

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| SOUND | All steps verified; endpoint follows from starting point |
| CONDITIONALLY SOUND | All steps verified under stated approximations |
| BROKEN | At least one P1 error blocks the conclusion |

State which verdict applies and why in one to three sentences.

**Amend** -- exactly three targeted fixes, each citing an F-ID from Phase 3.

Priority rule: if P1 faults exist in the register, your first fix must address a P1 fault. If no P1 faults exist but P2 faults exist, at least one fix must address a P2 fault. Highest-severity issue leads the Amend section.

1. [F-ID] [P1/P2/P3]: [specific fix -- state the exact correction, not generic advice]
2. [F-ID] [P1/P2/P3]: [specific fix]
3. [F-ID] [P1/P2/P3]: [specific fix]

If fewer than three F-IDs exist, use remaining slots for P3 clarity improvements on steps that were SOUND but had minor issues worth addressing.

---

## V-03 -- Explicit Severity Ordering Rule

**Axis**: Amend severity-ordering rule
**Hypothesis**: V-05-R3's priority rule says "if P1 faults exist, first fix must address P1; if no P1 but P2 exist, at least one fix must address P2." This closes P1-first but does not state P2-before-P3 as an ordering rule -- it requires "at least one P2 fix" to exist, not that all P2 fixes precede all P3 fixes. C-19 requires the explicit form "order fixes by severity: P1 first, then P2, then P3." An Amend that places a P3 fix before a P2 fix (when P2 faults exist) incidentally satisfies the old rule but fails C-19. Replacing the conditional priority rule with an unconditional ordering statement that names all three tiers closes this gap with one sentence.

---

## PHASE 1b -- STEP EXPANSION PASS

After completing the derivation map, scan each row for compressed steps -- any step where the paper jumps from one expression to a significantly different one without showing the intermediate algebra.

For each compressed step you identify:
- Insert sub-steps labeled S-NNa and S-NNb (or through S-NNc if more sub-steps are needed)
- The intermediate expression is the Resulting expression of S-NNa and the Starting expression of S-NNb
- Mark sub-step rows with "(interpolated)" in the Justification column -- this distinguishes your reconstruction from the paper's own steps

If no compressed steps exist, add: "No compressed steps identified -- C-10 auto-passes."

Interpolated sub-steps are verified in Phase 2 exactly like paper steps.

---

## PHASE 1b COMPLETION CHECK

Before proceeding to Phase 2, confirm that all three structural axes are active. Fill each Status cell with ACTIVE or ABSENT.

| Axis | Requirement | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| A -- Sub-step expansion | At least one interpolated sub-step inserted, OR "No compressed steps identified -- C-10 auto-passes" explicitly stated above | |
| B -- Prose reasoning | Prose-per-check rule (YES -- [sentence] / NO -- [sentence]) will apply to every check in every verification block in Phase 2 | |
| C -- Source acknowledgment | Source acknowledgment gate will execute for every WEAK or BROKEN step verdict in Phase 2 | |

All three must show ACTIVE before you proceed to Phase 2.
If any axis shows ABSENT: revisit Phase 1b (for Axis A) or reconfirm the Phase 2 rules (for Axes B and C).
Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until all three show ACTIVE.

---

## PHASE 2 -- STEP-BY-STEP VERIFICATION (primary output -- do not abbreviate)

For each step S-ID (including interpolated sub-steps from Phase 1b), produce a full verification block. This phase is the core deliverable of this skill -- allocate as much space as needed. Do not collapse multiple steps into one block. Do not omit a step because it looks trivial.

**Reasoning rule -- applies to all checks**: Do not write a bare YES or NO. Every verdict token must be followed by a dash and at least one sentence of reasoning. "YES -- [sentence]" or "NO -- [sentence]". A block containing only YES or NO tokens for any check fails the minimum standard.

**Density uniformity rule -- per step block**: Within any single step block, prose density must be uniform across the APPROX sub-block and the three primary checks (algebraic, dimensional, sign). If the APPROX sub-block contains at least one explanatory sentence, every primary check in that same block must also contain at least one explanatory sentence. The reverse also applies. Uniform means: sparse throughout the block, or rich throughout the block. Mixed density within a single step block -- rich APPROX prose alongside bare primary checks, or vice versa -- fails this rule.

**Amend** -- exactly three targeted fixes, each citing an F-ID from Phase 3.

Severity ordering rule: order all three fixes by severity -- P1 fixes first, then P2 fixes, then P3 fixes. The first fix is always the highest-severity fault present in the register. When the register contains faults at multiple severity levels, no lower-severity fix may precede a higher-severity fix in the list.

1. [F-ID] [P1/P2/P3]: [specific fix -- state the exact correction, not generic advice]
2. [F-ID] [P1/P2/P3]: [specific fix]
3. [F-ID] [P1/P2/P3]: [specific fix]

If fewer than three F-IDs exist, use remaining slots for P3 clarity improvements on steps that were SOUND but had minor issues worth addressing.

## V-04 -- Combined: EXACT/PHYSICAL Justification + Severity Ordering

**Axes**: V-01 (C-08 justification requirements) + V-03 (C-19 severity ordering rule)
**Hypothesis**: C-08 and C-19 are the two non-APPROX gaps in V-05-R3 -- C-08 is in Phase 1 (type definitions), C-19 is in Phase 4 (Amend preamble). Neither change touches Phase 2 or the gateway table. Stacking is structurally clean. Together they close both remaining non-APPROX criteria: C-08 (+3 pts) and C-19 (+5 pts) = 8 pts recovered, pushing V-04 to 135/145. If V-05's SOUND-BLOCKED gate triggers over-caution on APPROX steps and causes Phase 2 compression, V-04 is the preferred fallback -- it picks up the guaranteed structural points without touching the APPROX template.

You are running /simulate-derivation for: {{topic}}

Trace a mathematical derivation step by step -- the algebraic manipulation, not the logical argument. Catch sign errors, missing terms, unjustified approximations, dimensional inconsistencies.

**Before you begin**: read the paper for {{topic}}. If simulate-argument or discover-limiting-cases artifacts exist, read those. Identify the starting expression, the endpoint, and any approximations the paper names. That is all the acquisition you need.

---

## PHASE 1 -- DERIVATION MAP

Build the step table:

| S-ID | Starting expression | Operation applied | Resulting expression | Justification | Type |
|------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------|------|

Types:
- **EXACT**: exact algebraic identity -- the Justification cell must name the algebraic rule, identity, or substitution that makes this step exact (e.g., "product rule," "distributivity," "substitution of Eq. 3"). A step with an unexplained jump may not be labeled EXACT.
- **APPROX**: approximation made -- state what, under what conditions, whether paper names it
- **DEFINITION**: symbol introduced or substituted
- **PHYSICAL**: physical assumption encoded algebraically -- the Justification cell must state the physical assumption being encoded (e.g., "at equilibrium, dR/dt = 0," "incompressible flow," "quasi-static process")

Cover every non-trivial step. Minimum 3 rows.

---

## PHASE 1b -- STEP EXPANSION PASS

After completing the derivation map, scan each row for compressed steps -- any step where the paper jumps from one expression to a significantly different one without showing the intermediate algebra.

For each compressed step you identify:
- Insert sub-steps labeled S-NNa and S-NNb (or through S-NNc if more sub-steps are needed)
- The intermediate expression is the Resulting expression of S-NNa and the Starting expression of S-NNb
- Mark sub-step rows with "(interpolated)" in the Justification column -- this distinguishes your reconstruction from the paper's own steps

If no compressed steps exist, add: "No compressed steps identified -- C-10 auto-passes."

Interpolated sub-steps are verified in Phase 2 exactly like paper steps.

---

## PHASE 1b COMPLETION CHECK

Before proceeding to Phase 2, confirm that all three structural axes are active. Fill each Status cell with ACTIVE or ABSENT.

| Axis | Requirement | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| A -- Sub-step expansion | At least one interpolated sub-step inserted, OR "No compressed steps identified -- C-10 auto-passes" explicitly stated above | |
| B -- Prose reasoning | Prose-per-check rule (YES -- [sentence] / NO -- [sentence]) will apply to every check in every verification block in Phase 2 | |
| C -- Source acknowledgment | Source acknowledgment gate will execute for every WEAK or BROKEN step verdict in Phase 2 | |

All three must show ACTIVE before you proceed to Phase 2.
If any axis shows ABSENT: revisit Phase 1b (for Axis A) or reconfirm the Phase 2 rules (for Axes B and C).
Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until all three show ACTIVE.

---

## PHASE 2 -- STEP-BY-STEP VERIFICATION (primary output -- do not abbreviate)

For each step S-ID (including interpolated sub-steps from Phase 1b), produce a full verification block. This phase is the core deliverable of this skill -- allocate as much space as needed. Do not collapse multiple steps into one block. Do not omit a step because it looks trivial.

**Reasoning rule -- applies to all checks**: Do not write a bare YES or NO. Every verdict token must be followed by a dash and at least one sentence of reasoning. "YES -- [sentence]" or "NO -- [sentence]". A block containing only YES or NO tokens for any check fails the minimum standard.

**Density uniformity rule -- per step block**: Within any single step block, prose density must be uniform across the APPROX sub-block and the three primary checks (algebraic, dimensional, sign). If the APPROX sub-block contains at least one explanatory sentence, every primary check in that same block must also contain at least one explanatory sentence. The reverse also applies. Uniform means: sparse throughout the block, or rich throughout the block. Mixed density within a single step block -- rich APPROX prose alongside bare primary checks, or vice versa -- fails this rule.

```
S-[NN]: [description of what this step does] [(interpolated) if applicable]
From: [exact expression before the step]
Operation: [the specific algebraic or conceptual operation]
To: [exact expression after the step]

Algebraic correctness check:
  Does the algebra hold exactly?
  YES -- [identify the algebraic identity, rule, or substitution that makes this exact]
  NO -- [identify the exact error: wrong sign, missing term, wrong exponent, incorrect factoring]
  CONDITIONAL -- [state the condition that must hold and why the algebra fails outside it]

Dimensional consistency check:
  Are the units on LHS equal to units on RHS?
  YES -- [confirm which physical dimension appears on each side and how they match]
  NO -- [identify which side carries incorrect dimensions and which factor is responsible]
  NOT APPLICABLE -- [explain why dimensional analysis does not apply here]

Sign check:
  Does the sign of every term make physical or mathematical sense?
  YES -- [state the physical or mathematical principle that governs the expected sign]
  NO -- [identify the specific term, state the expected sign, and give the reasoning]

APPROX check (for APPROX-typed steps only -- skip for EXACT, DEFINITION, PHYSICAL):
  What quantity or relationship is being approximated?
    [state explicitly in the tracer's own words -- do not merely quote the paper]
  Under what conditions does this approximation hold?
    [name the domain regime, physical principle, or first-principles argument --
     e.g., "small-angle regime," "quasi-static assumption," "low Reynolds number."
     Do not paraphrase the source sentence; ground the statement in domain knowledge.]
  Source-removal test: if the source sentence describing this approximation were removed
    entirely, could you support your validity condition from domain knowledge alone?
    YES (independent) / NO (paraphrase)
    If NO: replace (b) with a domain-principle-grounded statement before recording your verdict.
  Does the source paper state this approximation by name or description? YES / NO
  Does the source paper give the validity condition? YES / NO

Step verdict: SOUND / WEAK / BROKEN
If WEAK or BROKEN: [exact description of the failure]

Source acknowledgment (complete only when verdict is WEAK or BROKEN):
  Does the source paper flag or acknowledge this specific issue anywhere --
  main text, footnotes, discussion section, or stated limitations? YES / NO
  If NO: this fault is a NEW finding -- the paper does not acknowledge it.
```

If the derivation contains zero APPROX-typed steps, add after all verification blocks:
> "APPROX check: no approximation steps found in this derivation. C-03 auto-passes."

---

## PHASE 3 -- DERIVATION FAULT REGISTER

| F-ID | S-ID | Verdict | Type | Description | Fix |
|------|------|---------|------|-------------|-----|

Severity:
- **P1** -- algebraically wrong
- **P2** -- approximation made but not stated (any WEAK/BROKEN from the APPROX check)
- **P3** -- correct but unclear, notational, or missing intermediate

Every WEAK or BROKEN verdict from Phase 2 must appear here. If no faults: write "No faults found." with a brief justification.

**NEW fault tagging**: For any fault where the source paper does not acknowledge the issue (as determined by your Phase 2 source acknowledgment check), append "NEW: not acknowledged by paper" to the Description column.

---

## PHASE 4 -- GLOBAL VERDICT AND AMEND

**Derivation Soundness Verdict** (required in a summary section -- do not bury in a step block):

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| SOUND | All steps verified; endpoint follows from starting point |
| CONDITIONALLY SOUND | All steps verified under stated approximations |
| BROKEN | At least one P1 error blocks the conclusion |

State which verdict applies and why in one to three sentences.

**Amend** -- exactly three targeted fixes, each citing an F-ID from Phase 3.

Severity ordering rule: order all three fixes by severity -- P1 fixes first, then P2 fixes, then P3 fixes. The first fix is always the highest-severity fault present in the register. When the register contains faults at multiple severity levels, no lower-severity fix may precede a higher-severity fix in the list.

2. [F-ID] [P1/P2/P3]: [specific fix]
3. [F-ID] [P1/P2/P3]: [specific fix]

If fewer than three F-IDs exist, use remaining slots for P3 clarity improvements on steps that were SOUND but had minor issues worth addressing.

## V-05 -- Full Ceiling: All Four New Axes

**Axes**: V-01 (C-08) + V-02 (C-17) + V-03 (C-19) + C-18 axis-C relabeling
**Hypothesis**: All four gaps that separate 127/145 from 142-145 are addressed simultaneously. V-01 recovers C-08 by naming the justification requirement inside the type definitions. V-02 recovers C-17 by adding an explicit SOUND BLOCKED verdict prohibition inside the "If NO" clause. V-03 recovers C-19 by replacing the conditional priority rule with an explicit P1->P2->P3 ordering statement. The C-18 tightening relabels gateway axis C from "Source acknowledgment gate" to "NEW-tagged fault detection" -- aligning the commitment table's axis label with the rubric language and closing the potential partial-fail on the gateway criterion. All four changes are structurally isolated: V-01 is Phase 1, V-02 is inside the Phase 2 APPROX template code block, V-03 is Phase 4, C-18 is the gateway table between Phases 1b and 2.

**Risk**: V-02's SOUND BLOCKED gate could trigger over-caution on APPROX blocks -- the LLM may produce elaborate replacement justifications that expand Phase 2 length and cause truncation. V-04 (C-08 + C-19 only) is the fallback if this happens.

## PHASE 1b -- STEP EXPANSION PASS

After completing the derivation map, scan each row for compressed steps -- any step where the paper jumps from one expression to a significantly different one without showing the intermediate algebra.

For each compressed step you identify:
- Insert sub-steps labeled S-NNa and S-NNb (or through S-NNc if more sub-steps are needed)

If no compressed steps exist, add: "No compressed steps identified -- C-10 auto-passes."

Interpolated sub-steps are verified in Phase 2 exactly like paper steps.

---

## PHASE 1b COMPLETION CHECK

Before proceeding to Phase 2, confirm that all three structural axes are active. Fill each Status cell with ACTIVE or ABSENT.

| Axis | Requirement | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| A -- Sub-step expansion | At least one interpolated sub-step inserted, OR "No compressed steps identified -- C-10 auto-passes" explicitly stated above | |
| B -- Prose reasoning | Prose-per-check rule (YES -- [sentence] / NO -- [sentence]) will apply to every check in every verification block in Phase 2 | |
| C -- NEW-tagged fault detection | Every WEAK or BROKEN verdict where the source paper does not acknowledge the issue will receive a "NEW: not acknowledged by paper" tag in the fault register | |

All present axes must show ACTIVE before you proceed to Phase 2.
If any axis shows ABSENT: revisit Phase 1b (for Axis A) or reconfirm the Phase 2 rules (for Axes B and C).
Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until all present axes show ACTIVE.

For each step S-ID (including interpolated sub-steps from Phase 1b), produce a full verification block. This phase is the core deliverable of this skill -- allocate as much space as needed. Do not collapse multiple steps into one block. Do not omit a step because it looks trivial.

**Reasoning rule -- applies to all checks**: Do not write a bare YES or NO. Every verdict token must be followed by a dash and at least one sentence of reasoning. "YES -- [sentence]" or "NO -- [sentence]". A block containing only YES or NO tokens for any check fails the minimum standard.

**Density uniformity rule -- per step block**: Within any single step block, prose density must be uniform across the APPROX sub-block and the three primary checks (algebraic, dimensional, sign). If the APPROX sub-block contains at least one explanatory sentence, every primary check in that same block must also contain at least one explanatory sentence. The reverse also applies. Uniform means: sparse throughout the block, or rich throughout the block. Mixed density within a single step block -- rich APPROX prose alongside bare primary checks, or vice versa -- fails this rule.
