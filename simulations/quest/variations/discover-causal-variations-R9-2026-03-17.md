## R9 Variations Summary

**Base:** R8 V-05 (200/200 under v9 -- ceiling)
**New criterion targeted:** C-30 (Phase 6 Falsification tracks Phase 3 anchor update)

| # | Label | Axis | Change from base | Expected |
|---|-------|------|-----------------|----------|
| V-01 | C-30 ARTIFACT field stripped | Lifecycle emphasis | `anchor_updated_from_phase1` removed from ARTIFACT; Phase 6 integration rule intact | ~195 |
| V-02 | C-30 integration rule stripped | Phrasing register | Phase 6 stale-anchor rule removed; ARTIFACT field intact | ~195 |
| V-03 | C-30 positive-only | Phrasing register | Integration rule states positive requirement only; no "does not pass" failure mode named | ~195 |
| V-04 | C-30 rule at Phase 3 only | Lifecycle emphasis | Rule moved to Phase 3 CONDITIONAL BRANCH; removed from Phase 6; ARTIFACT intact | ~195 |
| V-05 | Full ceiling + Phase 3 co-location | Combination + v10 scout | R8 V-05 intact + PROHIBITED FORM at Phase 3 naming that recording the update there does not close the Phase 6 propagation requirement | 200 |

**Four isolation tests:**

1. **V-01** -- Is the `anchor_updated_from_phase1` ARTIFACT field independently required, or does the integration rule alone satisfy C-30?
2. **V-02** -- Is the Phase 6 integration rule independently required, or does the ARTIFACT field alone satisfy C-30?
3. **V-03** -- Does C-30 require explicit failure mode naming ("does not pass"), or does a positive rule ("must carry Phase 3 step") alone satisfy it? Parallel to the C-22/C-20 pattern.
4. **V-04** -- Does C-30 require the rule at Phase 6 specifically (synthesis point), or does Phase 3 placement satisfy it? Parallel to C-29 requiring the C-26 integrity check at synthesis.

**V-05 v10 signal:** The stale-anchor PROHIBITED FORM co-located at Phase 3 -- explicitly stating that recording the update at Phase 3 does not close the Phase 6 propagation requirement. Mirrors the C-26/C-27 co-location pattern for the update path.
*V-04**: Does the stale-anchor rule satisfy C-30 when located at Phase 3 rather than Phase 6? Expects ~195 -- C-30 is an integration criterion requiring the check at the synthesis point, not at the production point.

**V-05 potential v10 signal:** C-30 requires an integration rule in Phase 6. An analogous co-location requirement (parallel to C-26/C-27 for the Phase 1 anchor) would require the stale-anchor prohibited form to also be named at Phase 3 -- the moment the update occurs -- not deferred to Phase 6. V-05 adds this co-location: a PROHIBITED FORM at Phase 3 CONDITIONAL BRANCH explicitly naming that recording the update at Phase 3 does not close the Phase 6 propagation requirement -- both sites must reflect the updated anchor.

**Single-axis:** V-01 through V-04 each remove or reposition one C-30 component and expect to drop from 200 to ~195. V-05 extends R8 V-05 with an additional enforcement site.

---

## V-01: C-30 ARTIFACT field stripped (lifecycle emphasis axis)

**Axis:** Lifecycle emphasis -- `anchor_updated_from_phase1` frontmatter field removed from PHASE 7 ARTIFACT. The Phase 6 integration rule naming the stale-anchor failure mode is preserved exactly from R8 V-05. No other changes.

**Hypothesis:** C-30 requires both an explicit integration rule AND the `anchor_updated_from_phase1` ARTIFACT field. The rubric says "where applicable, an `anchor_updated_from_phase1: true | false | n/a` ARTIFACT field to make the propagation status machine-readable." The question is whether "where applicable" means the field is optional (in which case V-01 passes C-30 at 200) or whether it is required whenever C-30 is gradeable (in which case V-01 fails C-30 at ~195). If the integration rule alone satisfies C-30, V-01 = 200. If the ARTIFACT field is independently required, V-01 drops. The ARTIFACT field is the variable being isolated.

You are running /discover-causal for topic: {topic}.

Hypothesis under review: {hypothesis}
(Claim: X causes Y. Test whether the mechanism is sound and whether the cause is the right one.)

=== PHASE 0: INERTIA GATE ===

Answer this before any mechanism work: does the status quo already produce Y?

Assess whether existing behaviors, market forces, platform trends, or workarounds
independently trend toward outcome Y -- without any new feature.

INERTIA VERDICT: [Competing / Not competing / Unclear]
Basis: [one sentence -- specific observation about the current state of the domain, not
assertion]

If Competing: the mechanism analysis in Phase 2 must explain what X produces that the
status quo does not. A mechanism that merely also produces Y alongside the status quo is
not a causal claim for X.

PROHIBITED FORM: Conditioning inertia incorporation on the verdict being Competing or
Unclear does not pass. All three verdict values -- Competing, Not competing, and Unclear --
must explicitly shape the amended claim in Phase 6. The Not competing verdict is a positive
bounding condition, not a neutral finding. A response that incorporates the inertia verdict
only when it is Competing or Unclear, and drops it when Not competing, has failed the
unconditional requirement regardless of how correctly the Competing and Unclear cases are
handled. "Not competing -- no adjustment needed" is the conditional form that fails.

=== PHASE 1: MECHANISM READINESS + PRELIMINARY ANCHOR ===

Before tracing, assess: can you name 3 or more observable intermediate steps between X
and Y, each with a named agent and observable indicator?

If yes: proceed to Phase 2.

If no: complete both sub-steps below before proceeding to Phase 2.

  SUB-STEP 1 -- Incompleteness declaration:
  Write: "PATHWAY INCOMPLETE: mechanism cannot be traced past [step]. Missing knowledge:
  [what evidence or domain knowledge is needed]."
  Then continue tracing in Phase 2 what can be traced, marking unsubstantiated steps
  [UNCERTAIN].

  SUB-STEP 2 -- Preliminary falsification anchor (required immediately after SUB-STEP 1):
  Name the highest-confidence step you can trace as a preliminary falsification anchor.
  Produce it here, before Phase 2 tracing begins.

  Required format:
  "PRELIMINARY ANCHOR: The mechanism most likely fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not
  occur, observable as [indicator]. Chain traceability ends here. Further falsification
  requires establishing [missing knowledge from SUB-STEP 1]."

  PROHIBITED FORM: Declaring incompleteness and proceeding to Phase 2 without producing
  this preliminary anchor in SUB-STEP 2 does not pass. The anchor must appear here, at the
  declaration point, before Phase 2. Phase 3 will confirm and extend it, but Phase 1 must
  produce it first. Deferring the anchor to Phase 3 -- writing "will determine in Phase 3"
  or equivalent -- does not satisfy this sub-step regardless of how accurately incompleteness
  was declared. Incompleteness changes the confidence annotation; it does not remove the
  requirement to name a step-level anchor here. Even one traceable step produces one
  falsifiable break point.

Producing three thin or vague steps to clear the readiness gate -- instead of declaring
incompleteness -- fails this phase. Accurate self-report is the required output.

=== PHASE 2: MECHANISM PATHWAY ===

Trace the causal pathway from X to Y.

STEP LABELING REQUIREMENT: Each step must carry a persistent formal label:
  Step N -- [Name]: What changes. Who acts. Observable indicator.

This is not a presentational preference -- it is a structural prerequisite. Phase 3
(falsification) and Phase 4 (evidence) reference steps by their formal label. A step listed
as a prose bullet or numbered without a persistent name has no stable referent for later
phases. Unlabeled steps make falsification anchoring and evidence gap enumeration fail
mechanically -- there is no name to anchor to. Use this format throughout. The same label
must appear identically in the pathway, in falsification, and in evidence gap sections.

If inertia status from Phase 0 is Competing: at least one step must describe what X
produces that the status quo does not.

Also: is there more than one plausible causal pathway from X to Y?
  - If yes: trace the primary pathway above and name the secondary pathway in one sentence.
    Note whether the two pathways are complementary, competing, or nested.
  - If no: note that the mechanism is singular.

=== PHASE 3: FALSIFICATION ===

Name the most likely mechanism break point. Reference the step by its Phase 2 label.

Required format:
"The mechanism fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not occur, observable as [indicator]."

Step number and name must match a labeled row in Phase 2 exactly. If a step is marked
[UNCERTAIN], it may still serve as a falsification anchor -- note the uncertainty in the
indicator description.

-- CONDITIONAL BRANCH: incomplete pathway --

If PATHWAY INCOMPLETE was declared in Phase 1, a PRELIMINARY ANCHOR is already on record
from Phase 1 SUB-STEP 2. This branch confirms and extends it.

Confirm the Phase 1 anchor. If Phase 2 tracing revealed additional labeled steps with
higher confidence than the Phase 1 preliminary anchor, update to the highest-confidence
step now on record.

Required format:
"BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR: The mechanism fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not occur,
observable as [indicator]. Note: pathway incompleteness means the chain cannot be verified
beyond step [N]. Further falsification requires establishing [missing knowledge from
Phase 1]."

PROHIBITED FORM (C-24): Declaring incompleteness and deferring or omitting step-level
falsification does not pass. A response that declares PATHWAY INCOMPLETE in Phase 1 and
then produces no step-level anchor -- writing deferral language or a metric threshold in
its place -- has not satisfied this section regardless of how accurately incompleteness was
declared. The incompleteness declaration removes the completeness requirement from the
anchor format; it does not remove the requirement to name an anchor. A pathway with one
traceable step produces one falsifiable break point. Incompleteness changes the confidence
annotation -- not the structural requirement to name a step-level anchor.

This branch confirms the Phase 1 anchor. It does not introduce fresh deferral.

-- END CONDITIONAL BRANCH --

Do not state falsification as a metric threshold. A metric shortfall is an outcome check.
Name where the mechanism stops working.

=== PHASE 4: CONTEXT EVIDENCE ===

Assess evidence per pathway step using the formal labels from Phase 2.

For each step:
  Step N -- [Name]: [evidence name, artifact, or "no evidence"] -- [T1 / T2 / T3 / none]
    T1 = anecdotal / observational / team intuition
    T2 = correlation / A-B / usage analytics / survey
    T3 = controlled / causal-inference-grade experiment

Reference steps by their formal Phase 2 label -- not by position or paraphrase.

FIELD INDEPENDENCE NOTE: The following two outputs measure different things. Produce them
as two separate named entries. Do not merge them into a single entry. Do not omit either.

  Evidence gap steps: [list Step N -- [Name] labels with no supporting evidence; write
    "none" if every step has evidence -- the absence of a gap does not eliminate this
    field; this output answers: which steps lack supporting evidence?]

  Aggregate evidence tier: [highest tier available -- T1/T2/T3/none; this output answers:
    what is the quality of the evidence that exists? -- independent of which steps are
    missing; produce both fields in every output]

These fields are orthogonal: gap steps names which steps lack evidence; aggregate tier
rates the quality of the evidence that is present. One does not substitute for the other.

NULL-GAP COUNTEREXAMPLE: The following is a valid, required output state:
  Evidence gap steps: none
  Aggregate evidence tier: T1
This state means every step in the pathway has supporting evidence, and that evidence is
anecdotal-grade. The Evidence gap steps field still appears; it carries the value "none."
The Aggregate evidence tier field still appears; it carries the value T1. A response that
omits Aggregate evidence tier because all steps are covered is making the category error
that these fields guard against -- it is conflating "no missing steps" with "no tier to
report." The null-gap state proves the fields are independent: gap answers which steps are
missing (here: none); tier answers what quality the present evidence has (here: T1). Both
are always required. Both always carry a value, even when gap is none.

PROPAGATION REQUIREMENT: The Evidence gap steps field does not stay in Phase 4. It must
also appear as a standalone named entry in Phase 6 AMEND, separately from the Aggregate
evidence tier field. Having evidence gap output here in Phase 4 does not substitute for
having it in Phase 6 AMEND -- the gap must propagate from the source section to the
synthesis point. A response where Evidence gap steps appears in Phase 4 but is absent from
Phase 6 AMEND as a named standalone entry does not pass.

Do not substitute general research for team-specific evidence. Note external evidence
separately if useful, but do not include it in the tier accounting.

=== PHASE 5: CONFOUNDER CHECK ===

This phase asks a DIFFERENT question from Phase 0.

Phase 0 asked: does the status quo trend toward Y over time, without intervention?
This phase asks: what else, operating RIGHT NOW alongside X, could independently produce Y?

The inertia case (Phase 0) is EXCLUDED from this analysis. It does not count as a
confounder -- it was answered in its own phase with its own verdict.

What you are looking for -- simultaneously-operating causes, not counterfactuals:
  - Competing initiatives active during the same deployment window
  - Confounding variables that correlate with X adoption and independently predict Y
  - Selection effects: the population using X differs from those who do not
  - Environmental or seasonal effects coinciding with X's deployment period

Name at least one alternative explanation for Y that:
  (a) does not involve X as a cause, AND
  (b) is not the inertia/status-quo case already addressed in Phase 0.

Explicitly acknowledge the exclusion: "The inertia case (Phase 0 verdict: [verdict]) is
not included here -- it was handled separately in Phase 0."

If no independently-operating cause can be identified, explain why the mechanism is
insulated from this type of confounding for this outcome type. Silence is not acceptable.

=== PHASE 6: AMEND ===

Produce a narrowed version of the hypothesis that integrates all prior analytical phases.
This section has required named inputs from each phase. Omitting any of them does not pass.

Required structure:
  Original: {hypothesis}
  Inertia verdict: {from Phase 0 -- Competing / Not competing / Unclear}
  Mechanism completeness: {complete / incomplete at Step N / partial -- from Phase 1;
    this is a standalone named field; a mechanism qualifier embedded within the Amended
    clause text ("X causes Y when the mechanism is fully traceable") does not satisfy this
    field; the completeness status must appear here as a named entry separate from the
    amended clause; write "complete" if Phase 1 found no gaps; write "incomplete at Step N"
    if PATHWAY INCOMPLETE was declared; write "partial" if some steps are [UNCERTAIN]}
  Evidence tier: {aggregate tier from Phase 4 -- T1/T2/T3/none}
  Evidence gap: {step labels lacking support from Phase 4 -- or "none"; this is a separate
    field from Evidence tier -- having one does not satisfy the other; a pathway with no
    gap steps still requires this field, carrying the value "none"}
  Confounder finding: {from Phase 5 -- name the alternative cause identified, or
    "none identified -- [reason why mechanism is insulated]"}
  Active pathway: {primary / secondary / both / singular}
  Falsification: {Step N -- Name -- break condition, or BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR if incomplete;
    for incomplete pathways, this field must carry the Phase 1 PRELIMINARY ANCHOR, updated
    for any additional steps traced in Phase 2; a Falsification field that first names the
    anchor here without a corresponding Phase 1 PRELIMINARY ANCHOR does not pass C-26}
  Amended: {narrower claim -- must include:
    (a) mechanism qualifier (what must be true in the causal chain for X to cause Y),
    (b) scope condition (population, context, or timeframe),
    (c) inertia incorporation -- required regardless of verdict value; no verdict makes
        inertia incorporation optional; use the form appropriate to the verdict:
          Competing: scope to contexts where the status quo does not already produce Y via
            [the competing mechanism]; or declare the feature causally redundant where the
            status quo already delivers Y
          Not competing: confirm explicitly that X is the causal driver and that the status
            quo does not independently produce Y -- this is a positive bounding condition
            that must appear in the amended claim, not be silently assumed
          Unclear: qualify the causal scope with the condition that status-quo independence
            has not been established -- the claim holds only if inertia can be ruled out for
            this context and population
    (d) confounder note if Phase 5 named a plausible alternative cause that bounds where
        the claim holds -- e.g., "provided [confounder] is not the active driver"}

Integration rules:
  - Evidence tier and Evidence gap are separate AMEND fields -- merging them or omitting
    either does not pass.
  - Mechanism completeness is a standalone named AMEND field -- embedding it within the
    amended clause text does not satisfy this field requirement.
  - A narrowed claim that ignores the inertia verdict does not pass -- no verdict value
    makes inertia incorporation optional.
  - Conditioning inertia incorporation on the verdict being Competing or Unclear does not
    pass -- all three verdict values require explicit reference in the amended claim. The
    Not competing case must shape the amended claim text; acknowledging it and then treating
    it as carrying no bounding force is the conditional form that fails.
  - Declaring incompleteness and deferring or omitting step-level falsification does not
    pass -- incompleteness changes the confidence annotation, not the structural requirement
    to name a step-level anchor; a PATHWAY INCOMPLETE response still carries a Falsification:
    field with a BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR value, not a deferral statement.
  - For incomplete pathways, the Falsification field must carry an anchor that was first
    produced in Phase 1 -- not first introduced here. A response where Phase 1 contains no
    PRELIMINARY ANCHOR and Phase 6 Falsification carries the first anchor does not pass
    C-26 -- the anchor appeared at the synthesis point, not at the declaration point.
  - For incomplete pathways where Phase 3 updated the preliminary anchor to a higher-
    confidence step, the Falsification field here must carry the updated step -- not the
    Phase 1 preliminary anchor verbatim. The field reflects the best anchor on record after
    all tracing, not the first anchor recorded. A response that carries the Phase 1
    preliminary anchor unchanged when Phase 3 identified and recorded a higher-confidence
    step does not pass -- Phase 3 updating the anchor is part of its confirmatory function;
    Phase 6 must reflect that update. If Phase 3 confirmed the Phase 1 anchor without
    updating (no higher-confidence step was found), Phase 6 carries the Phase 1 anchor as
    confirmed -- carrying the Phase 1 anchor verbatim is correct in that case and passes.
  - Evidence gap appearing only in Phase 4 (CONTEXT EVIDENCE) does not satisfy the Evidence
    gap AMEND field -- the gap must propagate from Phase 4 to Phase 6 as a standalone named
    entry; leaving it in Phase 4 does not pass. Just as Mechanism completeness must appear
    as a named AMEND field and not only in Phase 1, Evidence gap must appear as a named
    AMEND field and not only in Phase 4.
  - A narrowed claim that ignores mechanism incompleteness does not pass.
  - A narrowed claim that omits the confounder finding (when one was identified) does not
    pass. Partial synthesis is not synthesis -- all fields must be reflected.
  - Restating the original hypothesis does not pass. Broadening it does not pass.

## V-02: C-30 integration rule stripped (phrasing register axis)

**Axis:** Phrasing register -- the Phase 6 integration rule naming the stale-anchor failure mode is removed. R8 V-05 includes this bullet: "For incomplete pathways where Phase 3 updated the preliminary anchor to a higher-confidence step, the Falsification field here must carry the updated step -- not the Phase 1 preliminary anchor verbatim..." V-02 removes this entire bullet. The `anchor_updated_from_phase1: true | false | n/a` ARTIFACT field is preserved unchanged. All other Phase 1, Phase 3, and Phase 6 structure preserved from R8 V-05.

**Hypothesis:** C-30 requires "an explicit integration rule naming the stale-anchor failure mode." V-02 removes that rule while keeping the machine-readable ARTIFACT signal. If the integration rule is independently required (not substitutable by the ARTIFACT field), V-02 fails C-30 and drops to ~195. If the ARTIFACT field alone satisfies C-30, V-02 passes at 200. The integration rule is the variable being isolated.

Hypothesis under review: {hypothesis}
(Claim: X causes Y. Test whether the mechanism is sound and whether the cause is the right one.)

=== PHASE 0: INERTIA GATE ===

Answer this before any mechanism work: does the status quo already produce Y?

Assess whether existing behaviors, market forces, platform trends, or workarounds
independently trend toward outcome Y -- without any new feature.

INERTIA VERDICT: [Competing / Not competing / Unclear]
Basis: [one sentence -- specific observation about the current state of the domain, not
assertion]

If Competing: the mechanism analysis in Phase 2 must explain what X produces that the
status quo does not. A mechanism that merely also produces Y alongside the status quo is
not a causal claim for X.

PROHIBITED FORM: Conditioning inertia incorporation on the verdict being Competing or
Unclear does not pass. All three verdict values -- Competing, Not competing, and Unclear --
must explicitly shape the amended claim in Phase 6. The Not competing verdict is a positive
bounding condition, not a neutral finding. A response that incorporates the inertia verdict
only when it is Competing or Unclear, and drops it when Not competing, has failed the
unconditional requirement regardless of how correctly the Competing and Unclear cases are
handled. "Not competing -- no adjustment needed" is the conditional form that fails.

=== PHASE 1: MECHANISM READINESS + PRELIMINARY ANCHOR ===

Before tracing, assess: can you name 3 or more observable intermediate steps between X
and Y, each with a named agent and observable indicator?

If yes: proceed to Phase 2.

If no: complete both sub-steps below before proceeding to Phase 2.

  SUB-STEP 1 -- Incompleteness declaration:
  Write: "PATHWAY INCOMPLETE: mechanism cannot be traced past [step]. Missing knowledge:
  [what evidence or domain knowledge is needed]."
  Then continue tracing in Phase 2 what can be traced, marking unsubstantiated steps
  [UNCERTAIN].

  SUB-STEP 2 -- Preliminary falsification anchor (required immediately after SUB-STEP 1):
  Name the highest-confidence step you can trace as a preliminary falsification anchor.
  Produce it here, before Phase 2 tracing begins.

  Required format:
  "PRELIMINARY ANCHOR: The mechanism most likely fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not
  occur, observable as [indicator]. Chain traceability ends here. Further falsification
  requires establishing [missing knowledge from SUB-STEP 1]."

  PROHIBITED FORM: Declaring incompleteness and proceeding to Phase 2 without producing
  this preliminary anchor in SUB-STEP 2 does not pass. The anchor must appear here, at the
  declaration point, before Phase 2. Phase 3 will confirm and extend it, but Phase 1 must
  produce it first. Deferring the anchor to Phase 3 -- writing "will determine in Phase 3"
  or equivalent -- does not satisfy this sub-step regardless of how accurately incompleteness
  was declared. Incompleteness changes the confidence annotation; it does not remove the
  requirement to name a step-level anchor here. Even one traceable step produces one
  falsifiable break point.

Producing three thin or vague steps to clear the readiness gate -- instead of declaring
incompleteness -- fails this phase. Accurate self-report is the required output.

=== PHASE 2: MECHANISM PATHWAY ===

Trace the causal pathway from X to Y.

STEP LABELING REQUIREMENT: Each step must carry a persistent formal label:
  Step N -- [Name]: What changes. Who acts. Observable indicator.

This is not a presentational preference -- it is a structural prerequisite. Phase 3
(falsification) and Phase 4 (evidence) reference steps by their formal label. A step listed
as a prose bullet or numbered without a persistent name has no stable referent for later
phases. Unlabeled steps make falsification anchoring and evidence gap enumeration fail
mechanically -- there is no name to anchor to. Use this format throughout. The same label
must appear identically in the pathway, in falsification, and in evidence gap sections.

If inertia status from Phase 0 is Competing: at least one step must describe what X
produces that the status quo does not.

Also: is there more than one plausible causal pathway from X to Y?
  - If yes: trace the primary pathway above and name the secondary pathway in one sentence.
    Note whether the two pathways are complementary, competing, or nested.
  - If no: note that the mechanism is singular.

=== PHASE 3: FALSIFICATION ===

Name the most likely mechanism break point. Reference the step by its Phase 2 label.

Required format:
"The mechanism fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not occur, observable as [indicator]."

Step number and name must match a labeled row in Phase 2 exactly. If a step is marked
[UNCERTAIN], it may still serve as a falsification anchor -- note the uncertainty in the
indicator description.

-- CONDITIONAL BRANCH: incomplete pathway --

If PATHWAY INCOMPLETE was declared in Phase 1, a PRELIMINARY ANCHOR is already on record
from Phase 1 SUB-STEP 2. This branch confirms and extends it.

Confirm the Phase 1 anchor. If Phase 2 tracing revealed additional labeled steps with
higher confidence than the Phase 1 preliminary anchor, update to the highest-confidence
step now on record.

Required format:
"BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR: The mechanism fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not occur,
observable as [indicator]. Note: pathway incompleteness means the chain cannot be verified
beyond step [N]. Further falsification requires establishing [missing knowledge from
Phase 1]."

PROHIBITED FORM (C-24): Declaring incompleteness and deferring or omitting step-level
falsification does not pass. A response that declares PATHWAY INCOMPLETE in Phase 1 and
then produces no step-level anchor -- writing deferral language or a metric threshold in
its place -- has not satisfied this section regardless of how accurately incompleteness was
declared. The incompleteness declaration removes the completeness requirement from the
anchor format; it does not remove the requirement to name an anchor. A pathway with one
traceable step produces one falsifiable break point. Incompleteness changes the confidence
annotation -- not the structural requirement to name a step-level anchor.

This branch confirms the Phase 1 anchor. It does not introduce fresh deferral.

-- END CONDITIONAL BRANCH --

Do not state falsification as a metric threshold. A metric shortfall is an outcome check.
Name where the mechanism stops working.

=== PHASE 4: CONTEXT EVIDENCE ===

Assess evidence per pathway step using the formal labels from Phase 2.

For each step:
  Step N -- [Name]: [evidence name, artifact, or "no evidence"] -- [T1 / T2 / T3 / none]
    T1 = anecdotal / observational / team intuition
    T2 = correlation / A-B / usage analytics / survey
    T3 = controlled / causal-inference-grade experiment

Reference steps by their formal Phase 2 label -- not by position or paraphrase.

FIELD INDEPENDENCE NOTE: The following two outputs measure different things. Produce them
as two separate named entries. Do not merge them into a single entry. Do not omit either.

  Evidence gap steps: [list Step N -- [Name] labels with no supporting evidence; write
    "none" if every step has evidence -- the absence of a gap does not eliminate this
    field; this output answers: which steps lack supporting evidence?]

  Aggregate evidence tier: [highest tier available -- T1/T2/T3/none; this output answers:
    what is the quality of the evidence that exists? -- independent of which steps are
    missing; produce both fields in every output]

These fields are orthogonal: gap steps names which steps lack evidence; aggregate tier
rates the quality of the evidence that is present. One does not substitute for the other.

NULL-GAP COUNTEREXAMPLE: The following is a valid, required output state:
  Evidence gap steps: none
  Aggregate evidence tier: T1
This state means every step in the pathway has supporting evidence, and that evidence is
anecdotal-grade. The Evidence gap steps field still appears; it carries the value "none."
The Aggregate evidence tier field still appears; it carries the value T1. A response that
omits Aggregate evidence tier because all steps are covered is making the category error
that these fields guard against -- it is conflating "no missing steps" with "no tier to
report." The null-gap state proves the fields are independent: gap answers which steps are
missing (here: none); tier answers what quality the present evidence has (here: T1). Both
are always required. Both always carry a value, even when gap is none.

PROPAGATION REQUIREMENT: The Evidence gap steps field does not stay in Phase 4. It must
also appear as a standalone named entry in Phase 6 AMEND, separately from the Aggregate
evidence tier field. Having evidence gap output here in Phase 4 does not substitute for
having it in Phase 6 AMEND -- the gap must propagate from the source section to the
synthesis point. A response where Evidence gap steps appears in Phase 4 but is absent from
Phase 6 AMEND as a named standalone entry does not pass.

Do not substitute general research for team-specific evidence. Note external evidence
separately if useful, but do not include it in the tier accounting.

=== PHASE 5: CONFOUNDER CHECK ===

This phase asks a DIFFERENT question from Phase 0.

Phase 0 asked: does the status quo trend toward Y over time, without intervention?
This phase asks: what else, operating RIGHT NOW alongside X, could independently produce Y?

The inertia case (Phase 0) is EXCLUDED from this analysis. It does not count as a
confounder -- it was answered in its own phase with its own verdict.

What you are looking for -- simultaneously-operating causes, not counterfactuals:
  - Competing initiatives active during the same deployment window
  - Confounding variables that correlate with X adoption and independently predict Y
  - Selection effects: the population using X differs from those who do not
  - Environmental or seasonal effects coinciding with X's deployment period

Name at least one alternative explanation for Y that:
  (a) does not involve X as a cause, AND
  (b) is not the inertia/status-quo case already addressed in Phase 0.

Explicitly acknowledge the exclusion: "The inertia case (Phase 0 verdict: [verdict]) is
not included here -- it was handled separately in Phase 0."

If no independently-operating cause can be identified, explain why the mechanism is
insulated from this type of confounding for this outcome type. Silence is not acceptable.

=== PHASE 6: AMEND ===

Produce a narrowed version of the hypothesis that integrates all prior analytical phases.
This section has required named inputs from each phase. Omitting any of them does not pass.

Required structure:
  Original: {hypothesis}
  Inertia verdict: {from Phase 0 -- Competing / Not competing / Unclear}
  Mechanism completeness: {complete / incomplete at Step N / partial -- from Phase 1;
    this is a standalone named field; a mechanism qualifier embedded within the Amended
    clause text ("X causes Y when the mechanism is fully traceable") does not satisfy this
    field; the completeness status must appear here as a named entry separate from the
    amended clause; write "complete" if Phase 1 found no gaps; write "incomplete at Step N"
    if PATHWAY INCOMPLETE was declared; write "partial" if some steps are [UNCERTAIN]}
  Evidence tier: {aggregate tier from Phase 4 -- T1/T2/T3/none}
  Evidence gap: {step labels lacking support from Phase 4 -- or "none"; this is a separate
    field from Evidence tier -- having one does not satisfy the other; a pathway with no
    gap steps still requires this field, carrying the value "none"}
  Confounder finding: {from Phase 5 -- name the alternative cause identified, or
    "none identified -- [reason why mechanism is insulated]"}
  Active pathway: {primary / secondary / both / singular}
  Falsification: {Step N -- Name -- break condition, or BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR if incomplete;
    for incomplete pathways, this field must carry the Phase 1 PRELIMINARY ANCHOR, updated
    for any additional steps traced in Phase 2; a Falsification field that first names the
    anchor here without a corresponding Phase 1 PRELIMINARY ANCHOR does not pass C-26}
  Amended: {narrower claim -- must include:
    (a) mechanism qualifier (what must be true in the causal chain for X to cause Y),
    (b) scope condition (population, context, or timeframe),
    (c) inertia incorporation -- required regardless of verdict value; no verdict makes
        inertia incorporation optional; use the form appropriate to the verdict:
          Competing: scope to contexts where the status quo does not already produce Y via
            [the competing mechanism]; or declare the feature causally redundant where the
            status quo already delivers Y
          Not competing: confirm explicitly that X is the causal driver and that the status
            quo does not independently produce Y -- this is a positive bounding condition
            that must appear in the amended claim, not be silently assumed
          Unclear: qualify the causal scope with the condition that status-quo independence
            has not been established -- the claim holds only if inertia can be ruled out for
            this context and population
    (d) confounder note if Phase 5 named a plausible alternative cause that bounds where
        the claim holds -- e.g., "provided [confounder] is not the active driver"}

Integration rules:
  - Evidence tier and Evidence gap are separate AMEND fields -- merging them or omitting
    either does not pass.
  - Mechanism completeness is a standalone named AMEND field -- embedding it within the
    amended clause text does not satisfy this field requirement.
  - A narrowed claim that ignores the inertia verdict does not pass -- no verdict value
    makes inertia incorporation optional.
  - Conditioning inertia incorporation on the verdict being Competing or Unclear does not
    pass -- all three verdict values require explicit reference in the amended claim. The
    Not competing case must shape the amended claim text; acknowledging it and then treating
    it as carrying no bounding force is the conditional form that fails.
  - Declaring incompleteness and deferring or omitting step-level falsification does not
    pass -- incompleteness changes the confidence annotation, not the structural requirement
    to name a step-level anchor; a PATHWAY INCOMPLETE response still carries a Falsification:
    field with a BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR value, not a deferral statement.
  - For incomplete pathways, the Falsification field must carry an anchor that was first
    produced in Phase 1 -- not first introduced here. A response where Phase 1 contains no
    PRELIMINARY ANCHOR and Phase 6 Falsification carries the first anchor does not pass
    C-26 -- the anchor appeared at the synthesis point, not at the declaration point.
  - Evidence gap appearing only in Phase 4 (CONTEXT EVIDENCE) does not satisfy the Evidence
    gap AMEND field -- the gap must propagate from Phase 4 to Phase 6 as a standalone named
    entry; leaving it in Phase 4 does not pass. Just as Mechanism completeness must appear
    as a named AMEND field and not only in Phase 1, Evidence gap must appear as a named
    AMEND field and not only in Phase 4.
  - A narrowed claim that ignores mechanism incompleteness does not pass.
  - A narrowed claim that omits the confounder finding (when one was identified) does not
    pass. Partial synthesis is not synthesis -- all fields must be reflected.
  - Restating the original hypothesis does not pass. Broadening it does not pass.

## V-03: C-30 positive-only -- failure mode not named (phrasing register axis)

**Axis:** Phrasing register -- the Phase 6 stale-anchor integration rule is rewritten to state only the positive requirement, without explicitly naming the stale-anchor failure mode as a "does not pass" case. R8 V-05 names the failure mode explicitly: "A response that carries the Phase 1 preliminary anchor unchanged when Phase 3 identified and recorded a higher-confidence step does not pass." V-03 replaces this entire bullet with: "For incomplete pathways where Phase 3 updated the preliminary anchor, the Falsification field must carry the Phase 3 updated step." The ARTIFACT `anchor_updated_from_phase1` field is preserved unchanged.

**Hypothesis:** C-30 pass condition requires "an explicit integration rule naming the stale-anchor failure mode." The question is whether "naming the failure mode" requires explicit "does not pass" language -- analogous to how C-22 requires naming "conditioning inertia incorporation on the verdict being Competing or Unclear does not pass" rather than only stating the positive rule -- or whether a positive requirement ("must carry the Phase 3 step") alone satisfies C-30. If the failure mode naming is load-bearing, V-03 fails C-30 and drops to ~195. If the positive requirement alone satisfies C-30, V-03 passes at 200.

```
You are running /discover-causal for topic: {topic}.

Hypothesis under review: {hypothesis}
(Claim: X causes Y. Test whether the mechanism is sound and whether the cause is the right one.)

=== PHASE 0: INERTIA GATE ===

Answer this before any mechanism work: does the status quo already produce Y?

Assess whether existing behaviors, market forces, platform trends, or workarounds
independently trend toward outcome Y -- without any new feature.

INERTIA VERDICT: [Competing / Not competing / Unclear]
Basis: [one sentence -- specific observation about the current state of the domain, not
assertion]

If Competing: the mechanism analysis in Phase 2 must explain what X produces that the
status quo does not. A mechanism that merely also produces Y alongside the status quo is
not a causal claim for X.

PROHIBITED FORM: Conditioning inertia incorporation on the verdict being Competing or
Unclear does not pass. All three verdict values -- Competing, Not competing, and Unclear --
must explicitly shape the amended claim in Phase 6. The Not competing verdict is a positive
bounding condition, not a neutral finding. A response that incorporates the inertia verdict
only when it is Competing or Unclear, and drops it when Not competing, has failed the
unconditional requirement regardless of how correctly the Competing and Unclear cases are
handled. "Not competing -- no adjustment needed" is the conditional form that fails.

=== PHASE 1: MECHANISM READINESS + PRELIMINARY ANCHOR ===

Before tracing, assess: can you name 3 or more observable intermediate steps between X
and Y, each with a named agent and observable indicator?

If yes: proceed to Phase 2.

If no: complete both sub-steps below before proceeding to Phase 2.

  SUB-STEP 1 -- Incompleteness declaration:
  Write: "PATHWAY INCOMPLETE: mechanism cannot be traced past [step]. Missing knowledge:
  [what evidence or domain knowledge is needed]."
  Then continue tracing in Phase 2 what can be traced, marking unsubstantiated steps
  [UNCERTAIN].

  SUB-STEP 2 -- Preliminary falsification anchor (required immediately after SUB-STEP 1):
  Name the highest-confidence step you can trace as a preliminary falsification anchor.
  Produce it here, before Phase 2 tracing begins.

  Required format:
  "PRELIMINARY ANCHOR: The mechanism most likely fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not
  occur, observable as [indicator]. Chain traceability ends here. Further falsification
  requires establishing [missing knowledge from SUB-STEP 1]."

  PROHIBITED FORM: Declaring incompleteness and proceeding to Phase 2 without producing
  this preliminary anchor in SUB-STEP 2 does not pass. The anchor must appear here, at the
  declaration point, before Phase 2. Phase 3 will confirm and extend it, but Phase 1 must
  produce it first. Deferring the anchor to Phase 3 -- writing "will determine in Phase 3"
  or equivalent -- does not satisfy this sub-step regardless of how accurately incompleteness
  was declared. Incompleteness changes the confidence annotation; it does not remove the
  requirement to name a step-level anchor here. Even one traceable step produces one
  falsifiable break point.

Producing three thin or vague steps to clear the readiness gate -- instead of declaring
incompleteness -- fails this phase. Accurate self-report is the required output.

=== PHASE 2: MECHANISM PATHWAY ===

Trace the causal pathway from X to Y.

STEP LABELING REQUIREMENT: Each step must carry a persistent formal label:
  Step N -- [Name]: What changes. Who acts. Observable indicator.

This is not a presentational preference -- it is a structural prerequisite. Phase 3
(falsification) and Phase 4 (evidence) reference steps by their formal label. A step listed
as a prose bullet or numbered without a persistent name has no stable referent for later
phases. Unlabeled steps make falsification anchoring and evidence gap enumeration fail
mechanically -- there is no name to anchor to. Use this format throughout. The same label
must appear identically in the pathway, in falsification, and in evidence gap sections.

If inertia status from Phase 0 is Competing: at least one step must describe what X
produces that the status quo does not.

Also: is there more than one plausible causal pathway from X to Y?
  - If yes: trace the primary pathway above and name the secondary pathway in one sentence.
    Note whether the two pathways are complementary, competing, or nested.
  - If no: note that the mechanism is singular.

=== PHASE 3: FALSIFICATION ===

Name the most likely mechanism break point. Reference the step by its Phase 2 label.

Required format:
"The mechanism fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not occur, observable as [indicator]."

Step number and name must match a labeled row in Phase 2 exactly. If a step is marked
[UNCERTAIN], it may still serve as a falsification anchor -- note the uncertainty in the
indicator description.

-- CONDITIONAL BRANCH: incomplete pathway --

If PATHWAY INCOMPLETE was declared in Phase 1, a PRELIMINARY ANCHOR is already on record
from Phase 1 SUB-STEP 2. This branch confirms and extends it.

Confirm the Phase 1 anchor. If Phase 2 tracing revealed additional labeled steps with
higher confidence than the Phase 1 preliminary anchor, update to the highest-confidence
step now on record.

Required format:
"BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR: The mechanism fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not occur,
observable as [indicator]. Note: pathway incompleteness means the chain cannot be verified
beyond step [N]. Further falsification requires establishing [missing knowledge from
Phase 1]."

PROHIBITED FORM (C-24): Declaring incompleteness and deferring or omitting step-level
falsification does not pass. A response that declares PATHWAY INCOMPLETE in Phase 1 and
then produces no step-level anchor -- writing deferral language or a metric threshold in
its place -- has not satisfied this section regardless of how accurately incompleteness was
declared. The incompleteness declaration removes the completeness requirement from the
anchor format; it does not remove the requirement to name an anchor. A pathway with one
traceable step produces one falsifiable break point. Incompleteness changes the confidence
annotation -- not the structural requirement to name a step-level anchor.

This branch confirms the Phase 1 anchor. It does not introduce fresh deferral.

-- END CONDITIONAL BRANCH --

Do not state falsification as a metric threshold. A metric shortfall is an outcome check.
Name where the mechanism stops working.

=== PHASE 4: CONTEXT EVIDENCE ===

Assess evidence per pathway step using the formal labels from Phase 2.

For each step:
  Step N -- [Name]: [evidence name, artifact, or "no evidence"] -- [T1 / T2 / T3 / none]
    T1 = anecdotal / observational / team intuition
    T2 = correlation / A-B / usage analytics / survey
    T3 = controlled / causal-inference-grade experiment

Reference steps by their formal Phase 2 label -- not by position or paraphrase.

FIELD INDEPENDENCE NOTE: The following two outputs measure different things. Produce them
as two separate named entries. Do not merge them into a single entry. Do not omit either.

  Evidence gap steps: [list Step N -- [Name] labels with no supporting evidence; write
    "none" if every step has evidence -- the absence of a gap does not eliminate this
    field; this output answers: which steps lack supporting evidence?]

  Aggregate evidence tier: [highest tier available -- T1/T2/T3/none; this output answers:
    what is the quality of the evidence that exists? -- independent of which steps are
    missing; produce both fields in every output]

These fields are orthogonal: gap steps names which steps lack evidence; aggregate tier
rates the quality of the evidence that is present. One does not substitute for the other.

NULL-GAP COUNTEREXAMPLE: The following is a valid, required output state:
  Evidence gap steps: none
  Aggregate evidence tier: T1
This state means every step in the pathway has supporting evidence, and that evidence is
anecdotal-grade. The Evidence gap steps field still appears; it carries the value "none."
The Aggregate evidence tier field still appears; it carries the value T1. A response that
omits Aggregate evidence tier because all steps are covered is making the category error
that these fields guard against -- it is conflating "no missing steps" with "no tier to
report." The null-gap state proves the fields are independent: gap answers which steps are
missing (here: none); tier answers what quality the present evidence has (here: T1). Both
are always required. Both always carry a value, even when gap is none.

PROPAGATION REQUIREMENT: The Evidence gap steps field does not stay in Phase 4. It must
also appear as a standalone named entry in Phase 6 AMEND, separately from the Aggregate
evidence tier field. Having evidence gap output here in Phase 4 does not substitute for
having it in Phase 6 AMEND -- the gap must propagate from the source section to the
synthesis point. A response where Evidence gap steps appears in Phase 4 but is absent from
Phase 6 AMEND as a named standalone entry does not pass.

Do not substitute general research for team-specific evidence. Note external evidence
separately if useful, but do not include it in the tier accounting.

=== PHASE 5: CONFOUNDER CHECK ===

This phase asks a DIFFERENT question from Phase 0.

Phase 0 asked: does the status quo trend toward Y over time, without intervention?
This phase asks: what else, operating RIGHT NOW alongside X, could independently produce Y?

The inertia case (Phase 0) is EXCLUDED from this analysis. It does not count as a
confounder -- it was answered in its own phase with its own verdict.

What you are looking for -- simultaneously-operating causes, not counterfactuals:
  - Competing initiatives active during the same deployment window
  - Confounding variables that correlate with X adoption and independently predict Y
  - Selection effects: the population using X differs from those who do not
  - Environmental or seasonal effects coinciding with X's deployment period

Name at least one alternative explanation for Y that:
  (a) does not involve X as a cause, AND
  (b) is not the inertia/status-quo case already addressed in Phase 0.

Explicitly acknowledge the exclusion: "The inertia case (Phase 0 verdict: [verdict]) is
not included here -- it was handled separately in Phase 0."

If no independently-operating cause can be identified, explain why the mechanism is
insulated from this type of confounding for this outcome type. Silence is not acceptable.

=== PHASE 6: AMEND ===

Produce a narrowed version of the hypothesis that integrates all prior analytical phases.
This section has required named inputs from each phase. Omitting any of them does not pass.

Required structure:
  Original: {hypothesis}
  Inertia verdict: {from Phase 0 -- Competing / Not competing / Unclear}
  Mechanism completeness: {complete / incomplete at Step N / partial -- from Phase 1;
    this is a standalone named field; a mechanism qualifier embedded within the Amended
    clause text ("X causes Y when the mechanism is fully traceable") does not satisfy this
    field; the completeness status must appear here as a named entry separate from the
    amended clause; write "complete" if Phase 1 found no gaps; write "incomplete at Step N"
    if PATHWAY INCOMPLETE was declared; write "partial" if some steps are [UNCERTAIN]}
  Evidence tier: {aggregate tier from Phase 4 -- T1/T2/T3/none}
  Evidence gap: {step labels lacking support from Phase 4 -- or "none"; this is a separate
    field from Evidence tier -- having one does not satisfy the other; a pathway with no
    gap steps still requires this field, carrying the value "none"}
  Confounder finding: {from Phase 5 -- name the alternative cause identified, or
    "none identified -- [reason why mechanism is insulated]"}
  Active pathway: {primary / secondary / both / singular}
  Falsification: {Step N -- Name -- break condition, or BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR if incomplete;
    for incomplete pathways, this field must carry the Phase 1 PRELIMINARY ANCHOR, updated
    for any additional steps traced in Phase 2; a Falsification field that first names the
    anchor here without a corresponding Phase 1 PRELIMINARY ANCHOR does not pass C-26}
  Amended: {narrower claim -- must include:
    (a) mechanism qualifier (what must be true in the causal chain for X to cause Y),
    (b) scope condition (population, context, or timeframe),
    (c) inertia incorporation -- required regardless of verdict value; no verdict makes
        inertia incorporation optional; use the form appropriate to the verdict:
          Competing: scope to contexts where the status quo does not already produce Y via
            [the competing mechanism]; or declare the feature causally redundant where the
            status quo already delivers Y
          Not competing: confirm explicitly that X is the causal driver and that the status
            quo does not independently produce Y -- this is a positive bounding condition
            that must appear in the amended claim, not be silently assumed
          Unclear: qualify the causal scope with the condition that status-quo independence
            has not been established -- the claim holds only if inertia can be ruled out for
            this context and population
    (d) confounder note if Phase 5 named a plausible alternative cause that bounds where
        the claim holds -- e.g., "provided [confounder] is not the active driver"}

Integration rules:
  - Evidence tier and Evidence gap are separate AMEND fields -- merging them or omitting
    either does not pass.
  - Mechanism completeness is a standalone named AMEND field -- embedding it within the
    amended clause text does not satisfy this field requirement.
  - A narrowed claim that ignores the inertia verdict does not pass -- no verdict value
    makes inertia incorporation optional.
  - Conditioning inertia incorporation on the verdict being Competing or Unclear does not
    pass -- all three verdict values require explicit reference in the amended claim. The
    Not competing case must shape the amended claim text; acknowledging it and then treating
    it as carrying no bounding force is the conditional form that fails.
  - Declaring incompleteness and deferring or omitting step-level falsification does not
    pass -- incompleteness changes the confidence annotation, not the structural requirement
    to name a step-level anchor; a PATHWAY INCOMPLETE response still carries a Falsification:
    field with a BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR value, not a deferral statement.
  - For incomplete pathways, the Falsification field must carry an anchor that was first
    produced in Phase 1 -- not first introduced here. A response where Phase 1 contains no
    PRELIMINARY ANCHOR and Phase 6 Falsification carries the first anchor does not pass
    C-26 -- the anchor appeared at the synthesis point, not at the declaration point.
  - For incomplete pathways where Phase 3 updated the preliminary anchor to a higher-
    confidence step, the Falsification field here must carry the Phase 3 updated step.
  - Evidence gap appearing only in Phase 4 (CONTEXT EVIDENCE) does not satisfy the Evidence
    gap AMEND field -- the gap must propagate from Phase 4 to Phase 6 as a standalone named
    entry; leaving it in Phase 4 does not pass. Just as Mechanism completeness must appear
    as a named AMEND field and not only in Phase 1, Evidence gap must appear as a named
    AMEND field and not only in Phase 4.
  - A narrowed claim that ignores mechanism incompleteness does not pass.
  - A narrowed claim that omits the confounder finding (when one was identified) does not
    pass. Partial synthesis is not synthesis -- all fields must be reflected.
  - Restating the original hypothesis does not pass. Broadening it does not pass.

## V-04: C-30 rule at Phase 3 only (lifecycle emphasis axis)

**Axis:** Lifecycle emphasis -- the stale-anchor integration rule is moved from Phase 6 integration rules to Phase 3 CONDITIONAL BRANCH, where the update instruction already appears. Phase 3 now contains an explicit rule stating that Phase 6 Falsification must carry the updated step and that carrying the Phase 1 anchor verbatim when Phase 3 updated does not pass. The corresponding bullet is removed from Phase 6 integration rules. The ARTIFACT `anchor_updated_from_phase1` field is preserved unchanged.

**Hypothesis:** C-30 is an integration criterion requiring the stale-anchor check at the synthesis point (Phase 6 AMEND). If Phase 3 placement satisfies C-30, V-04 passes at 200. If C-30 requires the rule to be in Phase 6 specifically -- as an enforcement site that detects stale-anchor propagation at the point where the failure would appear -- V-04 fails at ~195. Parallel to C-29 requiring the C-26 integrity rule at synthesis (Phase 6), not only at Phase 3 where the anchor is produced: C-30 may require the stale-anchor check at Phase 6 (where the stale anchor would appear), not only at Phase 3 (where the update occurs). The positional requirement is the variable being isolated.

Hypothesis under review: {hypothesis}
(Claim: X causes Y. Test whether the mechanism is sound and whether the cause is the right one.)

=== PHASE 0: INERTIA GATE ===

Answer this before any mechanism work: does the status quo already produce Y?

Assess whether existing behaviors, market forces, platform trends, or workarounds
independently trend toward outcome Y -- without any new feature.

INERTIA VERDICT: [Competing / Not competing / Unclear]
Basis: [one sentence -- specific observation about the current state of the domain, not
assertion]

If Competing: the mechanism analysis in Phase 2 must explain what X produces that the
status quo does not. A mechanism that merely also produces Y alongside the status quo is
not a causal claim for X.

PROHIBITED FORM: Conditioning inertia incorporation on the verdict being Competing or
Unclear does not pass. All three verdict values -- Competing, Not competing, and Unclear --
must explicitly shape the amended claim in Phase 6. The Not competing verdict is a positive
bounding condition, not a neutral finding. A response that incorporates the inertia verdict
only when it is Competing or Unclear, and drops it when Not competing, has failed the
unconditional requirement regardless of how correctly the Competing and Unclear cases are
handled. "Not competing -- no adjustment needed" is the conditional form that fails.

=== PHASE 1: MECHANISM READINESS + PRELIMINARY ANCHOR ===

Before tracing, assess: can you name 3 or more observable intermediate steps between X
and Y, each with a named agent and observable indicator?

If yes: proceed to Phase 2.

If no: complete both sub-steps below before proceeding to Phase 2.

  SUB-STEP 1 -- Incompleteness declaration:
  Write: "PATHWAY INCOMPLETE: mechanism cannot be traced past [step]. Missing knowledge:
  [what evidence or domain knowledge is needed]."
  Then continue tracing in Phase 2 what can be traced, marking unsubstantiated steps
  [UNCERTAIN].

  SUB-STEP 2 -- Preliminary falsification anchor (required immediately after SUB-STEP 1):
  Name the highest-confidence step you can trace as a preliminary falsification anchor.
  Produce it here, before Phase 2 tracing begins.

  Required format:
  "PRELIMINARY ANCHOR: The mechanism most likely fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not
  occur, observable as [indicator]. Chain traceability ends here. Further falsification
  requires establishing [missing knowledge from SUB-STEP 1]."

  PROHIBITED FORM: Declaring incompleteness and proceeding to Phase 2 without producing
  this preliminary anchor in SUB-STEP 2 does not pass. The anchor must appear here, at the
  declaration point, before Phase 2. Phase 3 will confirm and extend it, but Phase 1 must
  produce it first. Deferring the anchor to Phase 3 -- writing "will determine in Phase 3"
  or equivalent -- does not satisfy this sub-step regardless of how accurately incompleteness
  was declared. Incompleteness changes the confidence annotation; it does not remove the
  requirement to name a step-level anchor here. Even one traceable step produces one
  falsifiable break point.

Producing three thin or vague steps to clear the readiness gate -- instead of declaring
incompleteness -- fails this phase. Accurate self-report is the required output.

=== PHASE 2: MECHANISM PATHWAY ===

Trace the causal pathway from X to Y.

STEP LABELING REQUIREMENT: Each step must carry a persistent formal label:
  Step N -- [Name]: What changes. Who acts. Observable indicator.

This is not a presentational preference -- it is a structural prerequisite. Phase 3
(falsification) and Phase 4 (evidence) reference steps by their formal label. A step listed
as a prose bullet or numbered without a persistent name has no stable referent for later
phases. Unlabeled steps make falsification anchoring and evidence gap enumeration fail
mechanically -- there is no name to anchor to. Use this format throughout. The same label
must appear identically in the pathway, in falsification, and in evidence gap sections.

If inertia status from Phase 0 is Competing: at least one step must describe what X
produces that the status quo does not.

Also: is there more than one plausible causal pathway from X to Y?
  - If yes: trace the primary pathway above and name the secondary pathway in one sentence.
    Note whether the two pathways are complementary, competing, or nested.
  - If no: note that the mechanism is singular.

=== PHASE 3: FALSIFICATION ===

Name the most likely mechanism break point. Reference the step by its Phase 2 label.

Required format:
"The mechanism fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not occur, observable as [indicator]."

Step number and name must match a labeled row in Phase 2 exactly. If a step is marked
[UNCERTAIN], it may still serve as a falsification anchor -- note the uncertainty in the
indicator description.

-- CONDITIONAL BRANCH: incomplete pathway --

If PATHWAY INCOMPLETE was declared in Phase 1, a PRELIMINARY ANCHOR is already on record
from Phase 1 SUB-STEP 2. This branch confirms and extends it.

Confirm the Phase 1 anchor. If Phase 2 tracing revealed additional labeled steps with
higher confidence than the Phase 1 preliminary anchor, update to the highest-confidence
step now on record.

Required format:
"BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR: The mechanism fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not occur,
observable as [indicator]. Note: pathway incompleteness means the chain cannot be verified
beyond step [N]. Further falsification requires establishing [missing knowledge from
Phase 1]."

ANCHOR-UPDATE PROPAGATION: If this branch updated the anchor to a higher-confidence step,
the Phase 6 Falsification field must carry the updated step -- not the Phase 1 preliminary
anchor verbatim. Carrying the Phase 1 anchor unchanged when this branch identified and
recorded a higher-confidence step does not pass. Phase 6 reflects the best anchor on
record after all tracing, not the first anchor recorded. If this branch confirmed the
Phase 1 anchor without updating (no higher-confidence step found), Phase 6 carries the
Phase 1 anchor as confirmed.

PROHIBITED FORM (C-24): Declaring incompleteness and deferring or omitting step-level
falsification does not pass. A response that declares PATHWAY INCOMPLETE in Phase 1 and
then produces no step-level anchor -- writing deferral language or a metric threshold in
its place -- has not satisfied this section regardless of how accurately incompleteness was
declared. The incompleteness declaration removes the completeness requirement from the
anchor format; it does not remove the requirement to name an anchor. A pathway with one
traceable step produces one falsifiable break point. Incompleteness changes the confidence
annotation -- not the structural requirement to name a step-level anchor.

This branch confirms the Phase 1 anchor. It does not introduce fresh deferral.

-- END CONDITIONAL BRANCH --

Do not state falsification as a metric threshold. A metric shortfall is an outcome check.
Name where the mechanism stops working.

=== PHASE 4: CONTEXT EVIDENCE ===

Assess evidence per pathway step using the formal labels from Phase 2.

For each step:
  Step N -- [Name]: [evidence name, artifact, or "no evidence"] -- [T1 / T2 / T3 / none]
    T1 = anecdotal / observational / team intuition
    T2 = correlation / A-B / usage analytics / survey
    T3 = controlled / causal-inference-grade experiment

Reference steps by their formal Phase 2 label -- not by position or paraphrase.

FIELD INDEPENDENCE NOTE: The following two outputs measure different things. Produce them
as two separate named entries. Do not merge them into a single entry. Do not omit either.

  Evidence gap steps: [list Step N -- [Name] labels with no supporting evidence; write
    "none" if every step has evidence -- the absence of a gap does not eliminate this
    field; this output answers: which steps lack supporting evidence?]

  Aggregate evidence tier: [highest tier available -- T1/T2/T3/none; this output answers:
    what is the quality of the evidence that exists? -- independent of which steps are
    missing; produce both fields in every output]

These fields are orthogonal: gap steps names which steps lack evidence; aggregate tier
rates the quality of the evidence that is present. One does not substitute for the other.

NULL-GAP COUNTEREXAMPLE: The following is a valid, required output state:
  Evidence gap steps: none
  Aggregate evidence tier: T1
This state means every step in the pathway has supporting evidence, and that evidence is
anecdotal-grade. The Evidence gap steps field still appears; it carries the value "none."
The Aggregate evidence tier field still appears; it carries the value T1. A response that
omits Aggregate evidence tier because all steps are covered is making the category error
that these fields guard against -- it is conflating "no missing steps" with "no tier to
report." The null-gap state proves the fields are independent: gap answers which steps are
missing (here: none); tier answers what quality the present evidence has (here: T1). Both
are always required. Both always carry a value, even when gap is none.

PROPAGATION REQUIREMENT: The Evidence gap steps field does not stay in Phase 4. It must
also appear as a standalone named entry in Phase 6 AMEND, separately from the Aggregate
evidence tier field. Having evidence gap output here in Phase 4 does not substitute for
having it in Phase 6 AMEND -- the gap must propagate from the source section to the
synthesis point. A response where Evidence gap steps appears in Phase 4 but is absent from
Phase 6 AMEND as a named standalone entry does not pass.

Do not substitute general research for team-specific evidence. Note external evidence
separately if useful, but do not include it in the tier accounting.

=== PHASE 5: CONFOUNDER CHECK ===

This phase asks a DIFFERENT question from Phase 0.

Phase 0 asked: does the status quo trend toward Y over time, without intervention?
This phase asks: what else, operating RIGHT NOW alongside X, could independently produce Y?

The inertia case (Phase 0) is EXCLUDED from this analysis. It does not count as a
confounder -- it was answered in its own phase with its own verdict.

What you are looking for -- simultaneously-operating causes, not counterfactuals:
  - Competing initiatives active during the same deployment window
  - Confounding variables that correlate with X adoption and independently predict Y
  - Selection effects: the population using X differs from those who do not
  - Environmental or seasonal effects coinciding with X's deployment period

Name at least one alternative explanation for Y that:
  (a) does not involve X as a cause, AND
  (b) is not the inertia/status-quo case already addressed in Phase 0.

Explicitly acknowledge the exclusion: "The inertia case (Phase 0 verdict: [verdict]) is
not included here -- it was handled separately in Phase 0."

If no independently-operating cause can be identified, explain why the mechanism is
insulated from this type of confounding for this outcome type. Silence is not acceptable.

=== PHASE 6: AMEND ===

Produce a narrowed version of the hypothesis that integrates all prior analytical phases.
This section has required named inputs from each phase. Omitting any of them does not pass.

Required structure:
  Original: {hypothesis}
  Inertia verdict: {from Phase 0 -- Competing / Not competing / Unclear}
  Mechanism completeness: {complete / incomplete at Step N / partial -- from Phase 1;
    this is a standalone named field; a mechanism qualifier embedded within the Amended
    clause text ("X causes Y when the mechanism is fully traceable") does not satisfy this
    field; the completeness status must appear here as a named entry separate from the
    amended clause; write "complete" if Phase 1 found no gaps; write "incomplete at Step N"
    if PATHWAY INCOMPLETE was declared; write "partial" if some steps are [UNCERTAIN]}
  Evidence tier: {aggregate tier from Phase 4 -- T1/T2/T3/none}
  Evidence gap: {step labels lacking support from Phase 4 -- or "none"; this is a separate
    field from Evidence tier -- having one does not satisfy the other; a pathway with no
    gap steps still requires this field, carrying the value "none"}
  Confounder finding: {from Phase 5 -- name the alternative cause identified, or
    "none identified -- [reason why mechanism is insulated]"}
  Active pathway: {primary / secondary / both / singular}
  Falsification: {Step N -- Name -- break condition, or BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR if incomplete;
    for incomplete pathways, this field must carry the Phase 1 PRELIMINARY ANCHOR, updated
    for any additional steps traced in Phase 2; a Falsification field that first names the
    anchor here without a corresponding Phase 1 PRELIMINARY ANCHOR does not pass C-26}
  Amended: {narrower claim -- must include:
    (a) mechanism qualifier (what must be true in the causal chain for X to cause Y),
    (b) scope condition (population, context, or timeframe),
    (c) inertia incorporation -- required regardless of verdict value; no verdict makes
        inertia incorporation optional; use the form appropriate to the verdict:
          Competing: scope to contexts where the status quo does not already produce Y via
            [the competing mechanism]; or declare the feature causally redundant where the
            status quo already delivers Y
          Not competing: confirm explicitly that X is the causal driver and that the status
            quo does not independently produce Y -- this is a positive bounding condition
            that must appear in the amended claim, not be silently assumed
          Unclear: qualify the causal scope with the condition that status-quo independence
            has not been established -- the claim holds only if inertia can be ruled out for
            this context and population
    (d) confounder note if Phase 5 named a plausible alternative cause that bounds where
        the claim holds -- e.g., "provided [confounder] is not the active driver"}

Integration rules:
  - Evidence tier and Evidence gap are separate AMEND fields -- merging them or omitting
    either does not pass.
  - Mechanism completeness is a standalone named AMEND field -- embedding it within the
    amended clause text does not satisfy this field requirement.
  - A narrowed claim that ignores the inertia verdict does not pass -- no verdict value
    makes inertia incorporation optional.
  - Conditioning inertia incorporation on the verdict being Competing or Unclear does not
    pass -- all three verdict values require explicit reference in the amended claim. The
    Not competing case must shape the amended claim text; acknowledging it and then treating
    it as carrying no bounding force is the conditional form that fails.
  - Declaring incompleteness and deferring or omitting step-level falsification does not
    pass -- incompleteness changes the confidence annotation, not the structural requirement
    to name a step-level anchor; a PATHWAY INCOMPLETE response still carries a Falsification:
    field with a BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR value, not a deferral statement.
  - For incomplete pathways, the Falsification field must carry an anchor that was first
    produced in Phase 1 -- not first introduced here. A response where Phase 1 contains no
    PRELIMINARY ANCHOR and Phase 6 Falsification carries the first anchor does not pass
    C-26 -- the anchor appeared at the synthesis point, not at the declaration point.
  - Evidence gap appearing only in Phase 4 (CONTEXT EVIDENCE) does not satisfy the Evidence
    gap AMEND field -- the gap must propagate from Phase 4 to Phase 6 as a standalone named
    entry; leaving it in Phase 4 does not pass. Just as Mechanism completeness must appear
    as a named AMEND field and not only in Phase 1, Evidence gap must appear as a named
    AMEND field and not only in Phase 4.
  - A narrowed claim that ignores mechanism incompleteness does not pass.
  - A narrowed claim that omits the confounder finding (when one was identified) does not
    pass. Partial synthesis is not synthesis -- all fields must be reflected.
  - Restating the original hypothesis does not pass. Broadening it does not pass.

## V-05: Full ceiling + Phase 3 co-location scout (combination + v10 scout)

**Axes:** All R8 V-05 enforcement sites preserved intact. One new element added to Phase 3 CONDITIONAL BRANCH: a PROHIBITED FORM co-located with the update instruction, explicitly naming the stale-anchor propagation failure mode at the moment the update is recorded -- not only at the Phase 6 synthesis point. This creates a second enforcement site for stale-anchor propagation: Phase 3 (production point of the update) and Phase 6 (synthesis point where the stale anchor would appear). Parallel to the C-26/C-27 pattern: C-26 requires the anchor at Phase 1; C-27 requires the prohibition co-located at Phase 1. C-30 requires the integration rule at Phase 6 (the synthesis point); a potential C-31 would require the prohibition co-located at Phase 3 (the update point).

**Hypothesis:** R8 V-05 achieves 200/200 under v9. V-05 adds one enforcement site not yet captured as a criterion: the stale-anchor prohibited form co-located at Phase 3. A model could pass C-30 (integration rule at Phase 6 naming the failure mode, ARTIFACT field present) while lacking the Phase 3 co-location that would close the escape hatch at the update point. If a v10 rubric targets this co-location, V-05 passes while V-01 through V-04 do not address it. The signal to watch: when Phase 3 explicitly names that correctly recording the update here does not close the Phase 6 propagation requirement, do models more reliably carry the updated step through to Phase 6?

```
You are running /discover-causal for topic: {topic}.

Hypothesis under review: {hypothesis}
(Claim: X causes Y. Test whether the mechanism is sound and whether the cause is the right one.)

=== PHASE 0: INERTIA GATE ===

Answer this before any mechanism work: does the status quo already produce Y?

Assess whether existing behaviors, market forces, platform trends, or workarounds
independently trend toward outcome Y -- without any new feature.

INERTIA VERDICT: [Competing / Not competing / Unclear]
Basis: [one sentence -- specific observation about the current state of the domain, not
assertion]

If Competing: the mechanism analysis in Phase 2 must explain what X produces that the
status quo does not. A mechanism that merely also produces Y alongside the status quo is
not a causal claim for X.

PROHIBITED FORM: Conditioning inertia incorporation on the verdict being Competing or
Unclear does not pass. All three verdict values -- Competing, Not competing, and Unclear --
must explicitly shape the amended claim in Phase 6. The Not competing verdict is a positive
bounding condition, not a neutral finding. A response that incorporates the inertia verdict
only when it is Competing or Unclear, and drops it when Not competing, has failed the
unconditional requirement regardless of how correctly the Competing and Unclear cases are
handled. "Not competing -- no adjustment needed" is the conditional form that fails.

=== PHASE 1: MECHANISM READINESS + PRELIMINARY ANCHOR ===

Before tracing, assess: can you name 3 or more observable intermediate steps between X
and Y, each with a named agent and observable indicator?

If yes: proceed to Phase 2.

If no: complete both sub-steps below before proceeding to Phase 2.

  SUB-STEP 1 -- Incompleteness declaration:
  Write: "PATHWAY INCOMPLETE: mechanism cannot be traced past [step]. Missing knowledge:
  [what evidence or domain knowledge is needed]."
  Then continue tracing in Phase 2 what can be traced, marking unsubstantiated steps
  [UNCERTAIN].

  SUB-STEP 2 -- Preliminary falsification anchor (required immediately after SUB-STEP 1):
  Name the highest-confidence step you can trace as a preliminary falsification anchor.
  Produce it here, before Phase 2 tracing begins.

  Required format:
  "PRELIMINARY ANCHOR: The mechanism most likely fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not
  occur, observable as [indicator]. Chain traceability ends here. Further falsification
  requires establishing [missing knowledge from SUB-STEP 1]."

  PROHIBITED FORM: Declaring incompleteness and proceeding to Phase 2 without producing
  this preliminary anchor in SUB-STEP 2 does not pass. The anchor must appear here, at the
  declaration point, before Phase 2. Phase 3 will confirm and extend it, but Phase 1 must
  produce it first. Deferring the anchor to Phase 3 -- writing "will determine in Phase 3"
  or equivalent -- does not satisfy this sub-step regardless of how accurately incompleteness
  was declared. Incompleteness changes the confidence annotation; it does not remove the
  requirement to name a step-level anchor here. Even one traceable step produces one
  falsifiable break point.

Producing three thin or vague steps to clear the readiness gate -- instead of declaring
incompleteness -- fails this phase. Accurate self-report is the required output.

=== PHASE 2: MECHANISM PATHWAY ===

Trace the causal pathway from X to Y.

STEP LABELING REQUIREMENT: Each step must carry a persistent formal label:
  Step N -- [Name]: What changes. Who acts. Observable indicator.

This is not a presentational preference -- it is a structural prerequisite. Phase 3
(falsification) and Phase 4 (evidence) reference steps by their formal label. A step listed
as a prose bullet or numbered without a persistent name has no stable referent for later
phases. Unlabeled steps make falsification anchoring and evidence gap enumeration fail
mechanically -- there is no name to anchor to. Use this format throughout. The same label
must appear identically in the pathway, in falsification, and in evidence gap sections.

If inertia status from Phase 0 is Competing: at least one step must describe what X
produces that the status quo does not.

Also: is there more than one plausible causal pathway from X to Y?
  - If yes: trace the primary pathway above and name the secondary pathway in one sentence.
    Note whether the two pathways are complementary, competing, or nested.
  - If no: note that the mechanism is singular.

=== PHASE 3: FALSIFICATION ===

Name the most likely mechanism break point. Reference the step by its Phase 2 label.

Required format:
"The mechanism fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not occur, observable as [indicator]."

Step number and name must match a labeled row in Phase 2 exactly. If a step is marked
[UNCERTAIN], it may still serve as a falsification anchor -- note the uncertainty in the
indicator description.

-- CONDITIONAL BRANCH: incomplete pathway --

If PATHWAY INCOMPLETE was declared in Phase 1, a PRELIMINARY ANCHOR is already on record
from Phase 1 SUB-STEP 2. This branch confirms and extends it.

Confirm the Phase 1 anchor. If Phase 2 tracing revealed additional labeled steps with
higher confidence than the Phase 1 preliminary anchor, update to the highest-confidence
step now on record.

Required format:
"BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR: The mechanism fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not occur,
observable as [indicator]. Note: pathway incompleteness means the chain cannot be verified
beyond step [N]. Further falsification requires establishing [missing knowledge from
Phase 1]."

ANCHOR-UPDATE PROHIBITED FORM: When this branch updates the preliminary anchor to a
higher-confidence step, recording the updated BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR here does not complete
the propagation requirement. Phase 6 Falsification must also carry the updated step --
correctly recording the update here does not close the Phase 6 propagation requirement.
Carrying the Phase 1 preliminary anchor verbatim in Phase 6 when this branch recorded a
higher-confidence step does not pass -- the stale-anchor propagation failure occurs at
Phase 6, not here. Both sites must reflect the updated anchor: this branch records it;
Phase 6 must carry it. If this branch confirms the Phase 1 anchor without updating (no
higher-confidence step found), Phase 6 carries the Phase 1 anchor as confirmed -- carrying
verbatim is correct and passes.

PROHIBITED FORM (C-24): Declaring incompleteness and deferring or omitting step-level
falsification does not pass. A response that declares PATHWAY INCOMPLETE in Phase 1 and
then produces no step-level anchor -- writing deferral language or a metric threshold in
its place -- has not satisfied this section regardless of how accurately incompleteness was
declared. The incompleteness declaration removes the completeness requirement from the
anchor format; it does not remove the requirement to name an anchor. A pathway with one
traceable step produces one falsifiable break point. Incompleteness changes the confidence
annotation -- not the structural requirement to name a step-level anchor.

This branch confirms the Phase 1 anchor. It does not introduce fresh deferral.

-- END CONDITIONAL BRANCH --

Do not state falsification as a metric threshold. A metric shortfall is an outcome check.
Name where the mechanism stops working.

=== PHASE 4: CONTEXT EVIDENCE ===

Assess evidence per pathway step using the formal labels from Phase 2.

For each step:
  Step N -- [Name]: [evidence name, artifact, or "no evidence"] -- [T1 / T2 / T3 / none]
    T1 = anecdotal / observational / team intuition
    T2 = correlation / A-B / usage analytics / survey
    T3 = controlled / causal-inference-grade experiment

Reference steps by their formal Phase 2 label -- not by position or paraphrase.

FIELD INDEPENDENCE NOTE: The following two outputs measure different things. Produce them
as two separate named entries. Do not merge them into a single entry. Do not omit either.

  Evidence gap steps: [list Step N -- [Name] labels with no supporting evidence; write
    "none" if every step has evidence -- the absence of a gap does not eliminate this
    field; this output answers: which steps lack supporting evidence?]

  Aggregate evidence tier: [highest tier available -- T1/T2/T3/none; this output answers:
    what is the quality of the evidence that exists? -- independent of which steps are
    missing; produce both fields in every output]

These fields are orthogonal: gap steps names which steps lack evidence; aggregate tier
rates the quality of the evidence that is present. One does not substitute for the other.

NULL-GAP COUNTEREXAMPLE: The following is a valid, required output state:
  Evidence gap steps: none
  Aggregate evidence tier: T1
This state means every step in the pathway has supporting evidence, and that evidence is
anecdotal-grade. The Evidence gap steps field still appears; it carries the value "none."
The Aggregate evidence tier field still appears; it carries the value T1. A response that
omits Aggregate evidence tier because all steps are covered is making the category error
that these fields guard against -- it is conflating "no missing steps" with "no tier to
report." The null-gap state proves the fields are independent: gap answers which steps are
missing (here: none); tier answers what quality the present evidence has (here: T1). Both
are always required. Both always carry a value, even when gap is none.

PROPAGATION REQUIREMENT: The Evidence gap steps field does not stay in Phase 4. It must
also appear as a standalone named entry in Phase 6 AMEND, separately from the Aggregate
evidence tier field. Having evidence gap output here in Phase 4 does not substitute for
having it in Phase 6 AMEND -- the gap must propagate from the source section to the
synthesis point. A response where Evidence gap steps appears in Phase 4 but is absent from
Phase 6 AMEND as a named standalone entry does not pass.

Do not substitute general research for team-specific evidence. Note external evidence
separately if useful, but do not include it in the tier accounting.

=== PHASE 5: CONFOUNDER CHECK ===

This phase asks a DIFFERENT question from Phase 0.

Phase 0 asked: does the status quo trend toward Y over time, without intervention?
This phase asks: what else, operating RIGHT NOW alongside X, could independently produce Y?

The inertia case (Phase 0) is EXCLUDED from this analysis. It does not count as a
confounder -- it was answered in its own phase with its own verdict.

What you are looking for -- simultaneously-operating causes, not counterfactuals:
  - Competing initiatives active during the same deployment window
  - Confounding variables that correlate with X adoption and independently predict Y
  - Selection effects: the population using X differs from those who do not
  - Environmental or seasonal effects coinciding with X's deployment period

Name at least one alternative explanation for Y that:
  (a) does not involve X as a cause, AND
  (b) is not the inertia/status-quo case already addressed in Phase 0.

Explicitly acknowledge the exclusion: "The inertia case (Phase 0 verdict: [verdict]) is
not included here -- it was handled separately in Phase 0."

If no independently-operating cause can be identified, explain why the mechanism is
insulated from this type of confounding for this outcome type. Silence is not acceptable.

=== PHASE 6: AMEND ===

Produce a narrowed version of the hypothesis that integrates all prior analytical phases.
This section has required named inputs from each phase. Omitting any of them does not pass.

Required structure:
  Original: {hypothesis}
  Inertia verdict: {from Phase 0 -- Competing / Not competing / Unclear}
  Mechanism completeness: {complete / incomplete at Step N / partial -- from Phase 1;
    this is a standalone named field; a mechanism qualifier embedded within the Amended
    clause text ("X causes Y when the mechanism is fully traceable") does not satisfy this
    field; the completeness status must appear here as a named entry separate from the
    amended clause; write "complete" if Phase 1 found no gaps; write "incomplete at Step N"
    if PATHWAY INCOMPLETE was declared; write "partial" if some steps are [UNCERTAIN]}
  Evidence tier: {aggregate tier from Phase 4 -- T1/T2/T3/none}
  Evidence gap: {step labels lacking support from Phase 4 -- or "none"; this is a separate
    field from Evidence tier -- having one does not satisfy the other; a pathway with no
    gap steps still requires this field, carrying the value "none"}
  Confounder finding: {from Phase 5 -- name the alternative cause identified, or
    "none identified -- [reason why mechanism is insulated]"}
  Active pathway: {primary / secondary / both / singular}
  Falsification: {Step N -- Name -- break condition, or BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR if incomplete;
    for incomplete pathways, this field must carry the Phase 1 PRELIMINARY ANCHOR, updated
    for any additional steps traced in Phase 2; a Falsification field that first names the
    anchor here without a corresponding Phase 1 PRELIMINARY ANCHOR does not pass C-26}
  Amended: {narrower claim -- must include:
    (a) mechanism qualifier (what must be true in the causal chain for X to cause Y),
    (b) scope condition (population, context, or timeframe),
    (c) inertia incorporation -- required regardless of verdict value; no verdict makes
        inertia incorporation optional; use the form appropriate to the verdict:
          Competing: scope to contexts where the status quo does not already produce Y via
            [the competing mechanism]; or declare the feature causally redundant where the
            status quo already delivers Y
          Not competing: confirm explicitly that X is the causal driver and that the status
            quo does not independently produce Y -- this is a positive bounding condition
            that must appear in the amended claim, not be silently assumed
          Unclear: qualify the causal scope with the condition that status-quo independence
            has not been established -- the claim holds only if inertia can be ruled out for
            this context and population
    (d) confounder note if Phase 5 named a plausible alternative cause that bounds where
        the claim holds -- e.g., "provided [confounder] is not the active driver"}

Integration rules:
  - Evidence tier and Evidence gap are separate AMEND fields -- merging them or omitting
    either does not pass.
  - Mechanism completeness is a standalone named AMEND field -- embedding it within the
    amended clause text does not satisfy this field requirement.
  - A narrowed claim that ignores the inertia verdict does not pass -- no verdict value
    makes inertia incorporation optional.
  - Conditioning inertia incorporation on the verdict being Competing or Unclear does not
    pass -- all three verdict values require explicit reference in the amended claim. The
    Not competing case must shape the amended claim text; acknowledging it and then treating
    it as carrying no bounding force is the conditional form that fails.
  - Declaring incompleteness and deferring or omitting step-level falsification does not
    pass -- incompleteness changes the confidence annotation, not the structural requirement
    to name a step-level anchor; a PATHWAY INCOMPLETE response still carries a Falsification:
    field with a BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR value, not a deferral statement.
  - For incomplete pathways, the Falsification field must carry an anchor that was first
    produced in Phase 1 -- not first introduced here. A response where Phase 1 contains no
    PRELIMINARY ANCHOR and Phase 6 Falsification carries the first anchor does not pass
    C-26 -- the anchor appeared at the synthesis point, not at the declaration point.
  - For incomplete pathways where Phase 3 updated the preliminary anchor to a higher-
    confidence step, the Falsification field here must carry the updated step -- not the
    Phase 1 preliminary anchor verbatim. The field reflects the best anchor on record after
    all tracing, not the first anchor recorded. A response that carries the Phase 1
    preliminary anchor unchanged when Phase 3 identified and recorded a higher-confidence
    step does not pass -- Phase 3 updating the anchor is part of its confirmatory function;
    Phase 6 must reflect that update. If Phase 3 confirmed the Phase 1 anchor without
    updating (no higher-confidence step was found), Phase 6 carries the Phase 1 anchor as
    confirmed -- carrying the Phase 1 anchor verbatim is correct in that case and passes.
  - Evidence gap appearing only in Phase 4 (CONTEXT EVIDENCE) does not satisfy the Evidence
    gap AMEND field -- the gap must propagate from Phase 4 to Phase 6 as a standalone named
    entry; leaving it in Phase 4 does not pass. Just as Mechanism completeness must appear
    as a named AMEND field and not only in Phase 1, Evidence gap must appear as a named
    AMEND field and not only in Phase 4.
  - A narrowed claim that ignores mechanism incompleteness does not pass.
  - A narrowed claim that omits the confounder finding (when one was identified) does not
    pass. Partial synthesis is not synthesis -- all fields must be reflected.
  - Restating the original hypothesis does not pass. Broadening it does not pass.
