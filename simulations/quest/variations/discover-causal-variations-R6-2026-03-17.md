R6 variations written. Here's the summary:

| # | Label | Axis | Target | Expected Score |
|---|-------|------|--------|----------------|
| V-01 | Named prohibition of falsification deferral form | Phrasing register | C-24 only | ~170/175 |
| V-02 | Evidence gap propagation requirement | Lifecycle emphasis | C-25 only | ~170/175 |
| V-03 | Incompleteness-anchored falsification (co-located) | Role sequence | C-24 via Phase 1 | ~170/175 |
| V-04 | Named prohibition + propagation, single-site each | Phrasing register + lifecycle emphasis | C-24 + C-25 | ~175/175 |
| V-05 | Full v6 aspirational stack | Combination | C-24 + C-25 dual-site | 175/175 |

**Design rationale:**

- R5 V-05 scores **165/175 under the v6 rubric** — it passes all R5 criteria but fails both C-24 and C-25
- **C-24 gap:** Phase 3 CONDITIONAL BRANCH lists specific prohibited phrases (`"Cannot falsify until..."`) but never says *"Declaring incompleteness and deferring step-level falsification does not pass"* — the same named-failure-mode gap C-22 was designed to close for inertia
- **C-25 gap:** Evidence gap is a named AMEND field in R5 V-05 (satisfying C-19) but there is no rule prohibiting the escape hatch of leaving it only in Phase 4 — the propagation requirement mirrors C-23's mechanism completeness pattern exactly

**V-03 tests a structural alternative to V-01:** co-locating the anchor requirement with the incompleteness declaration in Phase 1 (so Phase 3 becomes a confirmation rather than a fresh request). If the scorecard shows V-03 passes C-24 and V-01 also passes C-24, this reveals whether co-location or explicit prohibition language is the load-bearing mechanism.
ual-site pattern. C-25 intentionally absent.

**V-02 → C-25:** R5 V-05 passes C-19 (Evidence gap and Evidence tier are separate named AMEND fields) and passes C-21 (NULL-GAP COUNTEREXAMPLE block). The gap C-25 closes is orthogonal: even when Evidence gap is in AMEND, there is no explicit rule prohibiting the escape hatch where Evidence gap appears only in Phase 4 and is absent from AMEND. A model can produce evidence gap output in Phase 4 and then omit it from Phase 6 -- reasoning that Phase 4 already captured the information, or that the Evidence tier AMEND field covers it. C-25 requires naming this as a failure mode at the source (Phase 4, PROPAGATION REQUIREMENT block) and at the synthesis point (Phase 6 integration rules), parallel to how C-23 requires mechanism completeness to appear as a named AMEND field rather than only in Phase 1. C-24 intentionally absent.

**V-03 → C-24 via role sequence:** R5 V-05 places the deferral prohibition downstream in Phase 3. A model declaring incompleteness in Phase 1 has no anchor requirement until Phase 3 -- the phase separation creates a deferral window. V-03 closes this window structurally by co-locating the falsification anchor requirement with the incompleteness declaration in Phase 1 itself: PATHWAY INCOMPLETE must be followed immediately by a PRELIMINARY ANCHOR in the same section, with the "does not pass" language at the point of incompleteness declaration. Phase 3 CONDITIONAL BRANCH becomes a confirmation and extension step -- it cannot introduce a fresh deferral because Phase 1 already required and produced the anchor. The hypothesis is that co-location at the incompleteness production point closes the deferral window that downstream placement leaves open. C-25 intentionally absent.

## V-01: Named prohibition of falsification deferral form (phrasing register axis)

**Axis:** Phrasing register -- Phase 3 CONDITIONAL BRANCH gains an explicit PROHIBITED FORM statement naming the deferral form as a failure mode; the prohibition is repeated in Phase 6 integration rules following the C-22 dual-site pattern

**Hypothesis:** C-24 fails when Phase 3 structurally prevents deferral (listing specific prohibited phrases, requiring BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR format) without naming the deferral pattern itself as a failure mode. A model constructing the CONDITIONAL BRANCH believes structural compliance is sufficient -- it has avoided the prohibited phrases and provided the required format -- but has not internalized "declaring incompleteness and deferring step-level falsification does not pass" as a named criterion. The prohibited form exists in the model's output space and structural constraint alone does not close it. Adding the PROHIBITED FORM block names the escape hatch by form, parallel to how C-22 names the conditional-inertia form. Dual-site placement (Phase 3 + Phase 6) follows the C-22 pattern: a model that forgets the Phase 3 prohibition while writing Phase 6 still sees it at Phase 6; a model reading only Phase 6 for synthesis guidance sees it there. Base: R5 V-05 (165/165 under v5 rubric). C-25 gap (no evidence gap propagation rule) intentionally preserved for single-axis isolation.

You are running /discover-causal for topic: {topic}.

Hypothesis under review: {hypothesis}
(Claim: X causes Y. Test whether the mechanism is sound and whether the cause is the right one.)

=== PHASE 0: INERTIA GATE ===

Answer this before any mechanism work: does the status quo already produce Y?

Assess whether existing behaviors, market forces, platform trends, or workarounds
independently trend toward outcome Y -- without any new feature.

INERTIA VERDICT: [Competing / Not competing / Unclear]
Basis: [one sentence -- specific observation about the current state of the domain, not
assertion]

If Competing: the mechanism analysis in Phase 2 must explain what X produces that the
status quo does not. A mechanism that merely also produces Y alongside the status quo is
not a causal claim for X.

PROHIBITED FORM: Conditioning inertia incorporation on the verdict being Competing or
Unclear does not pass. All three verdict values -- Competing, Not competing, and Unclear --
must explicitly shape the amended claim in Phase 6. The Not competing verdict is a positive
bounding condition, not a neutral finding. A response that incorporates the inertia verdict
only when it is Competing or Unclear, and drops it when Not competing, has failed the
unconditional requirement regardless of how correctly the Competing and Unclear cases are
handled. "Not competing -- no adjustment needed" is the conditional form that fails.

=== PHASE 1: MECHANISM READINESS ===

Before tracing, assess: can you name 3 or more observable intermediate steps between X
and Y, each with a named agent and observable indicator?

If yes: proceed.
If no: declare incompleteness now.
  Write: "PATHWAY INCOMPLETE: mechanism cannot be traced past [step]. Missing knowledge:
  [what evidence or domain knowledge is needed]."
  Then continue with what can be traced, marking unsubstantiated steps [UNCERTAIN].

Producing three thin or vague steps to clear this gate -- instead of declaring
incompleteness -- fails this phase. Accurate self-report is the required output.

=== PHASE 2: MECHANISM PATHWAY ===

Trace the causal pathway from X to Y.

STEP LABELING REQUIREMENT: Each step must carry a persistent formal label:
  Step N -- [Name]: What changes. Who acts. Observable indicator.

This is not a presentational preference -- it is a structural prerequisite. Phase 3
(falsification) and Phase 4 (evidence) reference steps by their formal label. A step listed
as a prose bullet or numbered without a persistent name has no stable referent for later
phases. Unlabeled steps make falsification anchoring and evidence gap enumeration fail
mechanically -- there is no name to anchor to. Use this format throughout. The same label
must appear identically in the pathway, in falsification, and in evidence gap sections.

If inertia status from Phase 0 is Competing: at least one step must describe what X
produces that the status quo does not.

Also: is there more than one plausible causal pathway from X to Y?
  - If yes: trace the primary pathway above and name the secondary pathway in one sentence.
    Note whether the two pathways are complementary, competing, or nested.
  - If no: note that the mechanism is singular.

=== PHASE 3: FALSIFICATION ===

Name the most likely mechanism break point. Reference the step by its Phase 2 label.

Required format:
"The mechanism fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not occur, observable as [indicator]."

Step number and name must match a labeled row in Phase 2 exactly. If a step is marked
[UNCERTAIN], it may still serve as a falsification anchor -- note the uncertainty in the
indicator description.

-- CONDITIONAL BRANCH: incomplete pathway --

If PATHWAY INCOMPLETE was declared in Phase 1, this branch applies.

Do NOT defer falsification. Do NOT write:
  - "Cannot falsify until the mechanism is better understood."
  - "Falsification depends on completing the pathway."
  - A metric threshold ("if Y does not improve").

PROHIBITED FORM: Declaring incompleteness and deferring or omitting step-level
falsification does not pass. A response that declares PATHWAY INCOMPLETE in Phase 1 and
then produces no step-level anchor -- writing deferral language or a metric threshold in
its place -- has not satisfied this section regardless of how accurately incompleteness was
declared. The incompleteness declaration removes the completeness requirement from the
anchor format; it does not remove the requirement to name an anchor. A pathway with one
traceable step produces one falsifiable break point.

Instead: identify the highest-confidence labeled step traced and anchor falsification there.

Required format:
"BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR: The mechanism fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not occur,
observable as [indicator]. Note: pathway incompleteness means the chain cannot be verified
beyond step [N]. Further falsification requires establishing [missing knowledge from
Phase 1]."

Incompleteness changes the confidence annotation -- not the structural requirement to name
a step-level anchor. A partial pathway still produces at least one falsifiable break point.

-- END CONDITIONAL BRANCH --

Do not state falsification as a metric threshold. A metric shortfall is an outcome check.
Name where the mechanism stops working.

=== PHASE 4: CONTEXT EVIDENCE ===

Assess evidence per pathway step using the formal labels from Phase 2.

For each step:
  Step N -- [Name]: [evidence name, artifact, or "no evidence"] -- [T1 / T2 / T3 / none]
    T1 = anecdotal / observational / team intuition
    T2 = correlation / A-B / usage analytics / survey
    T3 = controlled / causal-inference-grade experiment

Reference steps by their formal Phase 2 label -- not by position or paraphrase.

FIELD INDEPENDENCE NOTE: The following two outputs measure different things. Produce them
as two separate named entries. Do not merge them into a single entry. Do not omit either.

  Evidence gap steps: [list Step N -- [Name] labels with no supporting evidence; write
    "none" if every step has evidence -- the absence of a gap does not eliminate this
    field; this output answers: which steps lack supporting evidence?]

  Aggregate evidence tier: [highest tier available -- T1/T2/T3/none; this output answers:
    what is the quality of the evidence that exists? -- independent of which steps are
    missing; produce both fields in every output]

These fields are orthogonal: gap steps names which steps lack evidence; aggregate tier
rates the quality of the evidence that is present. One does not substitute for the other.

NULL-GAP COUNTEREXAMPLE: The following is a valid, required output state:
  Evidence gap steps: none
  Aggregate evidence tier: T1
This state means every step in the pathway has supporting evidence, and that evidence is
anecdotal-grade. The Evidence gap steps field still appears; it carries the value "none."
The Aggregate evidence tier field still appears; it carries the value T1. A response that
omits Aggregate evidence tier because all steps are covered is making the category error
that these fields guard against -- it is conflating "no missing steps" with "no tier to
report." The null-gap state proves the fields are independent: gap answers which steps are
missing (here: none); tier answers what quality the present evidence has (here: T1). Both
are always required. Both always carry a value, even when gap is none.

Do not substitute general research for team-specific evidence. Note external evidence
separately if useful, but do not include it in the tier accounting.

=== PHASE 5: CONFOUNDER CHECK ===

This phase asks a DIFFERENT question from Phase 0.

Phase 0 asked: does the status quo trend toward Y over time, without intervention?
This phase asks: what else, operating RIGHT NOW alongside X, could independently produce Y?

The inertia case (Phase 0) is EXCLUDED from this analysis. It does not count as a
confounder -- it was answered in its own phase with its own verdict.

What you are looking for -- simultaneously-operating causes, not counterfactuals:
  - Competing initiatives active during the same deployment window
  - Confounding variables that correlate with X adoption and independently predict Y
  - Selection effects: the population using X differs from those who do not
  - Environmental or seasonal effects coinciding with X's deployment period

Name at least one alternative explanation for Y that:
  (a) does not involve X as a cause, AND
  (b) is not the inertia/status-quo case already addressed in Phase 0.

Explicitly acknowledge the exclusion: "The inertia case (Phase 0 verdict: [verdict]) is
not included here -- it was handled separately in Phase 0."

If no independently-operating cause can be identified, explain why the mechanism is
insulated from this type of confounding for this outcome type. Silence is not acceptable.

=== PHASE 6: AMEND ===

Produce a narrowed version of the hypothesis that integrates all prior analytical phases.
This section has required named inputs from each phase. Omitting any of them does not pass.

Required structure:
  Original: {hypothesis}
  Inertia verdict: {from Phase 0 -- Competing / Not competing / Unclear}
  Mechanism completeness: {complete / incomplete at Step N / partial -- from Phase 1;
    this is a standalone named field; a mechanism qualifier embedded within the Amended
    clause text ("X causes Y when the mechanism is fully traceable") does not satisfy this
    field; the completeness status must appear here as a named entry separate from the
    amended clause; write "complete" if Phase 1 found no gaps; write "incomplete at Step N"
    if PATHWAY INCOMPLETE was declared; write "partial" if some steps are [UNCERTAIN]}
  Evidence tier: {aggregate tier from Phase 4 -- T1/T2/T3/none}
  Evidence gap: {step labels lacking support from Phase 4 -- or "none"; this is a separate
    field from Evidence tier -- having one does not satisfy the other; a pathway with no
    gap steps still requires this field, carrying the value "none"}
  Confounder finding: {from Phase 5 -- name the alternative cause identified, or
    "none identified -- [reason why mechanism is insulated]"}
  Active pathway: {primary / secondary / both / singular}
  Falsification: {Step N -- Name -- break condition, or BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR if incomplete}
  Amended: {narrower claim -- must include:
    (a) mechanism qualifier (what must be true in the causal chain for X to cause Y),
    (b) scope condition (population, context, or timeframe),
    (c) inertia incorporation -- required regardless of verdict value; no verdict makes
        inertia incorporation optional; use the form appropriate to the verdict:
          Competing: scope to contexts where the status quo does not already produce Y via
            [the competing mechanism]; or declare the feature causally redundant where the
            status quo already delivers Y
          Not competing: confirm explicitly that X is the causal driver and that the status
            quo does not independently produce Y -- this is a positive bounding condition
            that must appear in the amended claim, not be silently assumed
          Unclear: qualify the causal scope with the condition that status-quo independence
            has not been established -- the claim holds only if inertia can be ruled out for
            this context and population
    (d) confounder note if Phase 5 named a plausible alternative cause that bounds where
        the claim holds -- e.g., "provided [confounder] is not the active driver"}

Integration rules:
  - Evidence tier and Evidence gap are separate AMEND fields -- merging them or omitting
    either does not pass.
  - Mechanism completeness is a standalone named AMEND field -- embedding it within the
    amended clause text does not satisfy this field requirement.
  - A narrowed claim that ignores the inertia verdict does not pass -- no verdict value
    makes inertia incorporation optional.
  - Conditioning inertia incorporation on the verdict being Competing or Unclear does not
    pass -- all three verdict values require explicit reference in the amended claim. The
    Not competing case must shape the amended claim text; acknowledging it and then treating
    it as carrying no bounding force is the conditional form that fails.
  - Declaring incompleteness and deferring or omitting step-level falsification does not
    pass -- incompleteness changes the confidence annotation, not the structural requirement
    to name a step-level anchor; a PATHWAY INCOMPLETE response still carries a Falsification:
    field with a BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR value, not a deferral.
  - A narrowed claim that ignores mechanism incompleteness does not pass.
  - A narrowed claim that omits the confounder finding (when one was identified) does not
    pass. Partial synthesis is not synthesis -- all fields must be reflected.
  - Restating the original hypothesis does not pass. Broadening it does not pass.

## V-02: Evidence gap propagation requirement (lifecycle emphasis axis)

**Axis:** Lifecycle emphasis -- Phase 4 FIELD INDEPENDENCE NOTE gains an explicit PROPAGATION REQUIREMENT block stating that Evidence gap steps must propagate from Phase 4 to Phase 6 as a standalone named AMEND field; Phase 6 integration rules gain the parallel named prohibition

**Hypothesis:** C-25 fails when Evidence gap is produced in Phase 4 without an explicit rule stating that this field must also appear in Phase 6 AMEND. R5 V-05 passes C-19 (Evidence gap is a named AMEND field) but does not name the escape hatch: "evidence gap only in Phase 4, absent from AMEND." A model producing evidence gap output in Phase 4 can still omit it from AMEND -- reasoning that Phase 4 already captured the information, or that the Evidence tier AMEND field covers it. C-25 requires naming this as a failure mode at the source section (Phase 4 PROPAGATION REQUIREMENT) and at the synthesis point (Phase 6 integration rules), parallel to how C-23 requires mechanism completeness to appear as a named AMEND field rather than only embedded in Phase 1. Base: R5 V-05. C-24 gap (no named prohibition of deferral form) intentionally preserved for single-axis isolation.

    as a named AMEND field and not only in Phase 1, Evidence gap must appear as a named
    AMEND field and not only in Phase 4.

  - A narrowed claim that omits the confounder finding (when one was identified) does not

## V-03: Incompleteness-anchored falsification (role sequence axis)

**Axis:** Role sequence -- Phase 1 (MECHANISM READINESS) is restructured to include an IMMEDIATE ANCHOR requirement when PATHWAY INCOMPLETE is declared; the "does not pass" language appears at the point of incompleteness declaration; Phase 3 CONDITIONAL BRANCH becomes a confirmation and extension step

**Hypothesis:** R5 V-05 places the deferral prohibition in Phase 3, downstream from Phase 1 where incompleteness is declared. The phase separation creates a window: a model declares PATHWAY INCOMPLETE in Phase 1, continues tracing in Phase 2, and reaches Phase 3 where it faces the anchor requirement for the first time. V-03 closes this window by co-locating the anchor requirement with the incompleteness declaration in Phase 1 itself. When PATHWAY INCOMPLETE is declared, a PRELIMINARY ANCHOR must be produced immediately in Phase 1 -- before any further tracing. The "does not pass" language appears in Phase 1 at the incompleteness production point. Phase 3 CONDITIONAL BRANCH becomes a confirmation: it extends or updates the Phase 1 anchor rather than requesting a fresh one. A model cannot defer to Phase 3 what Phase 1 already required and produced. The hypothesis: co-location at the incompleteness production point closes the deferral window that downstream placement leaves open. C-25 gap intentionally preserved for single-axis isolation.

You are running /discover-causal for topic: {topic}.

Hypothesis under review: {hypothesis}
(Claim: X causes Y. Test whether the mechanism is sound and whether the cause is the right one.)

=== PHASE 0: INERTIA GATE ===

Answer this before any mechanism work: does the status quo already produce Y?

Assess whether existing behaviors, market forces, platform trends, or workarounds
independently trend toward outcome Y -- without any new feature.

INERTIA VERDICT: [Competing / Not competing / Unclear]
Basis: [one sentence -- specific observation about the current state of the domain, not
assertion]

If Competing: the mechanism analysis in Phase 2 must explain what X produces that the
status quo does not. A mechanism that merely also produces Y alongside the status quo is
not a causal claim for X.

PROHIBITED FORM: Conditioning inertia incorporation on the verdict being Competing or
Unclear does not pass. All three verdict values -- Competing, Not competing, and Unclear --
must explicitly shape the amended claim in Phase 6. The Not competing verdict is a positive
bounding condition, not a neutral finding. "Not competing -- no adjustment needed" is the
conditional form that fails.

=== PHASE 1: MECHANISM READINESS + PRELIMINARY ANCHOR ===

Before tracing, assess: can you name 3 or more observable intermediate steps between X
and Y, each with a named agent and observable indicator?

If yes: proceed to Phase 2.

If no: complete both sub-steps below before proceeding.

  SUB-STEP 1 -- Incompleteness declaration:
  Write: "PATHWAY INCOMPLETE: mechanism cannot be traced past [step]. Missing knowledge:
  [what evidence or domain knowledge is needed]."
  Then continue tracing what can be traced in Phase 2, marking unsubstantiated steps
  [UNCERTAIN].

  SUB-STEP 2 -- Preliminary anchor (required immediately after the declaration above):
  Name the highest-confidence step you can trace -- even if only one step -- as a
  preliminary falsification anchor. Produce it now, before Phase 2 tracing continues.

  Required format:
  "PRELIMINARY ANCHOR: The mechanism most likely fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not
  occur, observable as [indicator]. Chain traceability ends here. Further falsification
  requires establishing [missing knowledge from SUB-STEP 1]."

  Declaring incompleteness and deferring or omitting this preliminary anchor does not pass.
  The anchor must appear in Phase 1 immediately after the incompleteness declaration.
  Incompleteness changes the confidence annotation; it does not remove the requirement to
  name an anchor. A pathway with one traceable step produces one falsifiable break point.

Producing three thin or vague steps to clear the readiness gate -- instead of declaring
incompleteness -- fails this phase. Accurate self-report is the required output.

=== PHASE 2: MECHANISM PATHWAY ===

Trace the causal pathway from X to Y.

STEP LABELING REQUIREMENT: Each step must carry a persistent formal label:
  Step N -- [Name]: What changes. Who acts. Observable indicator.

This is not a presentational preference -- it is a structural prerequisite. Phase 3
(falsification) and Phase 4 (evidence) reference steps by their formal label. Unlabeled
steps make falsification anchoring and evidence gap enumeration fail mechanically. Use this
format throughout. The same label must appear identically in the pathway, in falsification,
and in evidence gap sections.

If inertia status from Phase 0 is Competing: at least one step must describe what X
produces that the status quo does not.

Also: is there more than one plausible causal pathway from X to Y?
  - If yes: trace the primary pathway above and name the secondary pathway in one sentence.
    Note whether the two pathways are complementary, competing, or nested.
  - If no: note that the mechanism is singular.

=== PHASE 3: FALSIFICATION ===

Name the most likely mechanism break point. Reference the step by its Phase 2 label.

Required format:
"The mechanism fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not occur, observable as [indicator]."

Step number and name must match a labeled row in Phase 2 exactly. If a step is marked
[UNCERTAIN], it may still serve as a falsification anchor -- note the uncertainty in the
indicator description.

-- CONDITIONAL BRANCH: incomplete pathway --

If PATHWAY INCOMPLETE was declared in Phase 1, a PRELIMINARY ANCHOR is on record from
Phase 1. Confirm and extend it here.

Required format:
"BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR: [Confirm the Phase 1 anchor. If Phase 2 tracing revealed
additional high-confidence labeled steps, update the anchor to the highest-confidence
step now on record. Format: The mechanism fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not occur,
observable as [indicator]. Note: pathway incompleteness means the chain cannot be verified
beyond step [N]. Further falsification requires establishing [missing knowledge from
Phase 1].]"

Phase 3 confirms and extends the Phase 1 anchor. It does not introduce fresh deferral.
A response that re-defers here -- writing "cannot falsify until..." or offering a metric
threshold -- has not satisfied this section; the Phase 1 anchor is already on record.

-- END CONDITIONAL BRANCH --

Do not state falsification as a metric threshold. Name where the mechanism stops working.

=== PHASE 4: CONTEXT EVIDENCE ===

Assess evidence per pathway step using the formal labels from Phase 2.

For each step:
  Step N -- [Name]: [evidence name, artifact, or "no evidence"] -- [T1 / T2 / T3 / none]
    T1 = anecdotal / observational / team intuition
    T2 = correlation / A-B / usage analytics / survey
    T3 = controlled / causal-inference-grade experiment

Reference steps by their formal Phase 2 label -- not by position or paraphrase.

FIELD INDEPENDENCE NOTE: The following two outputs measure different things. Produce them
as two separate named entries. Do not merge them into a single entry. Do not omit either.

  Evidence gap steps: [list Step N -- [Name] labels with no supporting evidence; write
    "none" if every step has evidence -- the absence of a gap does not eliminate this
    field; this output answers: which steps lack supporting evidence?]

  Aggregate evidence tier: [highest tier available -- T1/T2/T3/none; this output answers:
    what is the quality of the evidence that exists? -- independent of which steps are
    missing; produce both fields in every output]

These fields are orthogonal. One does not substitute for the other.

NULL-GAP COUNTEREXAMPLE: The following is a valid, required output state:
  Evidence gap steps: none
  Aggregate evidence tier: T1
This state means every step in the pathway has supporting evidence, and that evidence is
anecdotal-grade. Both fields are always required. Both always carry a value, even when
gap is none. A response that omits Aggregate evidence tier because all steps are covered
is conflating "no missing steps" with "no tier to report."

Do not substitute general research for team-specific evidence. Note external evidence
separately if useful, but do not include it in the tier accounting.

=== PHASE 5: CONFOUNDER CHECK ===

This phase asks a DIFFERENT question from Phase 0.

Phase 0 asked: does the status quo trend toward Y over time, without intervention?
This phase asks: what else, operating RIGHT NOW alongside X, could independently produce Y?

The inertia case (Phase 0) is EXCLUDED from this analysis. It does not count as a
confounder -- it was answered in its own phase with its own verdict.

What you are looking for -- simultaneously-operating causes, not counterfactuals:
  - Competing initiatives active during the same deployment window
  - Confounding variables that correlate with X adoption and independently predict Y
  - Selection effects: the population using X differs from those who do not
  - Environmental or seasonal effects coinciding with X's deployment period

Name at least one alternative explanation for Y that:
  (a) does not involve X as a cause, AND
  (b) is not the inertia/status-quo case already addressed in Phase 0.

Explicitly acknowledge the exclusion: "The inertia case (Phase 0 verdict: [verdict]) is
not included here -- it was handled separately in Phase 0."

If no independently-operating cause can be identified, explain why the mechanism is
insulated from this type of confounding for this outcome type. Silence is not acceptable.

=== PHASE 6: AMEND ===

Produce a narrowed version of the hypothesis that integrates all prior analytical phases.
This section has required named inputs from each phase. Omitting any of them does not pass.

Required structure:
  Original: {hypothesis}
  Inertia verdict: {from Phase 0 -- Competing / Not competing / Unclear}
  Mechanism completeness: {complete / incomplete at Step N / partial -- from Phase 1;
    this is a standalone named field; embedding it in the amended clause text does not
    satisfy this field; write "complete" if Phase 1 found no gaps; write "incomplete at
    Step N" if PATHWAY INCOMPLETE was declared; write "partial" if some steps are
    [UNCERTAIN]}
  Evidence tier: {aggregate tier from Phase 4 -- T1/T2/T3/none}
  Evidence gap: {step labels lacking support from Phase 4 -- or "none"; this is a separate
    field from Evidence tier -- having one does not satisfy the other; a pathway with no
    gap steps still requires this field, carrying the value "none"}
  Confounder finding: {from Phase 5 -- name the alternative cause identified, or
    "none identified -- [reason why mechanism is insulated]"}
  Active pathway: {primary / secondary / both / singular}
  Falsification: {Step N -- Name -- break condition, or BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR if incomplete;
    for incomplete pathways, confirm the Phase 1 PRELIMINARY ANCHOR here, updated for any
    additional steps traced in Phase 2}
  Amended: {narrower claim -- must include:
    (a) mechanism qualifier (what must be true in the causal chain for X to cause Y),
    (b) scope condition (population, context, or timeframe),
    (c) inertia incorporation -- required regardless of verdict value; no verdict makes
        inertia incorporation optional; use the form appropriate to the verdict:
          Competing: scope to contexts where the status quo does not already produce Y via
            [the competing mechanism]; or declare the feature causally redundant where the
            status quo already delivers Y
          Not competing: confirm explicitly that X is the causal driver and that the status
            quo does not independently produce Y -- this is a positive bounding condition
            that must appear in the amended claim, not be silently assumed
          Unclear: qualify the causal scope with the condition that status-quo independence
            has not been established -- the claim holds only if inertia can be ruled out for
            this context and population
    (d) confounder note if Phase 5 named a plausible alternative cause that bounds where
        the claim holds}

Integration rules:
  - Evidence tier and Evidence gap are separate AMEND fields -- merging them or omitting
    either does not pass.
  - Mechanism completeness is a standalone named AMEND field -- embedding it within the
    amended clause text does not satisfy this field requirement.
  - A narrowed claim that ignores the inertia verdict does not pass -- no verdict value
    makes inertia incorporation optional.
  - Conditioning inertia incorporation on the verdict being Competing or Unclear does not
    pass -- all three verdict values require explicit reference in the amended claim.
  - A narrowed claim that ignores mechanism incompleteness does not pass.
  - A narrowed claim that omits the confounder finding (when one was identified) does not
    pass. Partial synthesis is not synthesis -- all fields must be reflected.
  - Restating the original hypothesis does not pass. Broadening it does not pass.

## V-04: Named prohibition + evidence gap propagation, single-site each (phrasing register + lifecycle emphasis)

**Axes:** Phrasing register (C-24 PROHIBITED FORM in Phase 3 only) + lifecycle emphasis (C-25 PROPAGATION REQUIREMENT in Phase 4 only) -- both new v6 criteria addressed simultaneously with single-site placement; Phase 6 integration rules do not add C-24 or C-25 prohibitions

**Hypothesis:** C-24 and C-25 are independent structural gaps that can be addressed simultaneously without conflicting. C-24 is closed by adding the PROHIBITED FORM block to Phase 3 CONDITIONAL BRANCH: "Declaring incompleteness and deferring or omitting step-level falsification does not pass." C-25 is closed by adding the PROPAGATION REQUIREMENT block to Phase 4: "Having evidence gap output in Phase 4 does not substitute for having it in Phase 6 AMEND." Both fixes are compatible with the R5 V-05 phase structure. V-04 tests single-site placement for both: each prohibition appears once, at the analytical production point, without repetition at Phase 6. The question is whether single-site is sufficient to satisfy the criteria or whether dual-site placement (V-05) is required. Base: R5 V-05 (165/175 under v6 rubric).

(Claim: X causes Y. Test whether the mechanism is sound and whether the cause is the right one.)

=== PHASE 0: INERTIA GATE ===

Answer this before any mechanism work: does the status quo already produce Y?

INERTIA VERDICT: [Competing / Not competing / Unclear]
Basis: [one sentence -- specific observation about the current state of the domain, not
assertion]

If Competing: the mechanism analysis in Phase 2 must explain what X produces that the
status quo does not. A mechanism that merely also produces Y alongside the status quo is
not a causal claim for X.

PROHIBITED FORM: Conditioning inertia incorporation on the verdict being Competing or
Unclear does not pass. All three verdict values -- Competing, Not competing, and Unclear --
must explicitly shape the amended claim in Phase 6. The Not competing verdict is a positive
bounding condition, not a neutral finding. A response that incorporates the inertia verdict
only when it is Competing or Unclear, and drops it when Not competing, has failed the
unconditional requirement. "Not competing -- no adjustment needed" is the conditional form
that fails.

=== PHASE 1: MECHANISM READINESS ===

Before tracing, assess: can you name 3 or more observable intermediate steps between X
and Y, each with a named agent and observable indicator?

If yes: proceed.
If no: declare incompleteness now.
  Write: "PATHWAY INCOMPLETE: mechanism cannot be traced past [step]. Missing knowledge:
  [what evidence or domain knowledge is needed]."
  Then continue with what can be traced, marking unsubstantiated steps [UNCERTAIN].

Producing three thin or vague steps to clear this gate -- instead of declaring
incompleteness -- fails this phase. Accurate self-report is the required output.

=== PHASE 2: MECHANISM PATHWAY ===

Trace the causal pathway from X to Y.

STEP LABELING REQUIREMENT: Each step must carry a persistent formal label:
  Step N -- [Name]: What changes. Who acts. Observable indicator.

This is not a presentational preference -- it is a structural prerequisite. Phase 3
(falsification) and Phase 4 (evidence) reference steps by their formal label. Unlabeled
steps make falsification anchoring and evidence gap enumeration fail mechanically. Use this
format throughout. The same label must appear identically in the pathway, in falsification,
and in evidence gap sections.

If inertia status from Phase 0 is Competing: at least one step must describe what X
produces that the status quo does not.

Also: is there more than one plausible causal pathway from X to Y?
  - If yes: trace the primary pathway above and name the secondary pathway in one sentence.
    Note whether the two pathways are complementary, competing, or nested.
  - If no: note that the mechanism is singular.

=== PHASE 3: FALSIFICATION ===

Name the most likely mechanism break point. Reference the step by its Phase 2 label.

Required format:
"The mechanism fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not occur, observable as [indicator]."

Step number and name must match a labeled row in Phase 2 exactly. If a step is marked
[UNCERTAIN], it may still serve as a falsification anchor -- note the uncertainty in the
indicator description.

-- CONDITIONAL BRANCH: incomplete pathway --

If PATHWAY INCOMPLETE was declared in Phase 1, this branch applies.

Do NOT defer falsification. Do NOT write:
  - "Cannot falsify until the mechanism is better understood."
  - "Falsification depends on completing the pathway."
  - A metric threshold ("if Y does not improve").

PROHIBITED FORM: Declaring incompleteness and deferring or omitting step-level
falsification does not pass. A response that declares PATHWAY INCOMPLETE in Phase 1 and
then produces no step-level anchor -- writing deferral language or a metric threshold in
its place -- has not satisfied this section regardless of how accurately incompleteness was
declared. The incompleteness declaration removes the completeness requirement from the
anchor format; it does not remove the requirement to name an anchor. A pathway with one
traceable step produces one falsifiable break point.

Instead: identify the highest-confidence labeled step traced and anchor falsification there.

Required format:
"BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR: The mechanism fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not occur,
observable as [indicator]. Note: pathway incompleteness means the chain cannot be verified
beyond step [N]. Further falsification requires establishing [missing knowledge from
Phase 1]."

Incompleteness changes the confidence annotation -- not the structural requirement to name
a step-level anchor. A partial pathway still produces at least one falsifiable break point.

-- END CONDITIONAL BRANCH --

Do not state falsification as a metric threshold. Name where the mechanism stops working.

=== PHASE 4: CONTEXT EVIDENCE ===

Assess evidence per pathway step using the formal labels from Phase 2.

For each step:
  Step N -- [Name]: [evidence name, artifact, or "no evidence"] -- [T1 / T2 / T3 / none]
    T1 = anecdotal / observational / team intuition
    T2 = correlation / A-B / usage analytics / survey
    T3 = controlled / causal-inference-grade experiment

Reference steps by their formal Phase 2 label -- not by position or paraphrase.

FIELD INDEPENDENCE NOTE: The following two outputs measure different things. Produce them
as two separate named entries. Do not merge them into a single entry. Do not omit either.

  Evidence gap steps: [list Step N -- [Name] labels with no supporting evidence; write
    "none" if every step has evidence -- the absence of a gap does not eliminate this
    field; this output answers: which steps lack supporting evidence?]

  Aggregate evidence tier: [highest tier available -- T1/T2/T3/none; this output answers:
    what is the quality of the evidence that exists? -- independent of which steps are
    missing; produce both fields in every output]

These fields are orthogonal: gap steps names which steps lack evidence; aggregate tier
rates the quality of the evidence that is present. One does not substitute for the other.

NULL-GAP COUNTEREXAMPLE: The following is a valid, required output state:
  Evidence gap steps: none
  Aggregate evidence tier: T1
This state means every step in the pathway has supporting evidence, and that evidence is
anecdotal-grade. The Evidence gap steps field still appears; it carries the value "none."
The Aggregate evidence tier field still appears; it carries the value T1. A response that
omits Aggregate evidence tier because all steps are covered is making the category error
that these fields guard against -- conflating "no missing steps" with "no tier to report."
Both are always required. Both always carry a value, even when gap is none.

PROPAGATION REQUIREMENT: The Evidence gap steps field does not stay in Phase 4. It must
also appear as a standalone named entry in Phase 6 AMEND, separately from the Aggregate
evidence tier field. Having evidence gap output here in Phase 4 does not substitute for
having it in Phase 6 AMEND -- the gap must propagate from the source section to the
synthesis point. A response where Evidence gap steps appears in Phase 4 but is absent from
Phase 6 AMEND as a named standalone entry does not pass.

Do not substitute general research for team-specific evidence. Note external evidence
separately if useful, but do not include it in the tier accounting.

=== PHASE 5: CONFOUNDER CHECK ===

This phase asks a DIFFERENT question from Phase 0.

Phase 0 asked: does the status quo trend toward Y over time, without intervention?
This phase asks: what else, operating RIGHT NOW alongside X, could independently produce Y?

The inertia case (Phase 0) is EXCLUDED from this analysis. It does not count as a

    (d) confounder note if Phase 5 named a plausible alternative cause that bounds where

    Not competing case must shape the amended claim text; acknowledging it and then treating
    it as carrying no bounding force is the conditional form that fails.
  - A narrowed claim that ignores mechanism incompleteness does not pass.
  - A narrowed claim that omits the confounder finding (when one was identified) does not
    pass. Partial synthesis is not synthesis -- all fields must be reflected.

## V-05: Full v6 aspirational stack (combination)

**Axes:** All v6 axes combined -- C-24 PROHIBITED FORM in Phase 3 (production point) and Phase 6 integration rules (synthesis point); C-25 PROPAGATION REQUIREMENT in Phase 4 (source section) and Phase 6 integration rules (synthesis point); all R5 V-05 structures preserved

**Hypothesis:** C-24 and C-25 can both be added to the R5 V-05 phase structure with four surgical changes that do not conflict with any prior phase structure:
(a) Phase 3 CONDITIONAL BRANCH gains a PROHIBITED FORM statement: "Declaring incompleteness and deferring or omitting step-level falsification does not pass" (C-24 -- production point);
(b) Phase 4 FIELD INDEPENDENCE NOTE gains a PROPAGATION REQUIREMENT block: "Having evidence gap output in Phase 4 does not substitute for having it in Phase 6 AMEND" (C-25 -- source section);
(c) Phase 6 integration rules gain the C-24 prohibition by name: "declaring incompleteness and deferring step-level falsification does not pass -- a PATHWAY INCOMPLETE response still carries a BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR" (C-24 -- synthesis point);
(d) Phase 6 integration rules gain the C-25 prohibition by name: "Evidence gap appearing only in Phase 4 does not satisfy the AMEND field -- the gap must propagate to Phase 6 as a standalone named entry" (C-25 -- synthesis point).
Dual-site placement follows the C-22 pattern: a model that forgets the production-point prohibition while writing Phase 6 still sees it at Phase 6; a model reading only Phase 6 for synthesis guidance sees both prohibitions there. Expected ceiling: 175/175.

handled. "Not competing -- no adjustment needed" is the conditional form that fails.

=== PHASE 1: MECHANISM READINESS ===

Before tracing, assess: can you name 3 or more observable intermediate steps between X
and Y, each with a named agent and observable indicator?

If yes: proceed.
If no: declare incompleteness now.
  Write: "PATHWAY INCOMPLETE: mechanism cannot be traced past [step]. Missing knowledge:
  [what evidence or domain knowledge is needed]."
  Then continue with what can be traced, marking unsubstantiated steps [UNCERTAIN].

Producing three thin or vague steps to clear this gate -- instead of declaring
incompleteness -- fails this phase. Accurate self-report is the required output.

=== PHASE 2: MECHANISM PATHWAY ===

Trace the causal pathway from X to Y.

STEP LABELING REQUIREMENT: Each step must carry a persistent formal label:
  Step N -- [Name]: What changes. Who acts. Observable indicator.

This is not a presentational preference -- it is a structural prerequisite. Phase 3
(falsification) and Phase 4 (evidence) reference steps by their formal label. A step listed
as a prose bullet or numbered without a persistent name has no stable referent for later
phases. Unlabeled steps make falsification anchoring and evidence gap enumeration fail
mechanically -- there is no name to anchor to. Use this format throughout. The same label
must appear identically in the pathway, in falsification, and in evidence gap sections.

If inertia status from Phase 0 is Competing: at least one step must describe what X
produces that the status quo does not.

Also: is there more than one plausible causal pathway from X to Y?
  - If yes: trace the primary pathway above and name the secondary pathway in one sentence.
    Note whether the two pathways are complementary, competing, or nested.
  - If no: note that the mechanism is singular.

=== PHASE 3: FALSIFICATION ===

Name the most likely mechanism break point. Reference the step by its Phase 2 label.

Required format:
"The mechanism fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not occur, observable as [indicator]."

Step number and name must match a labeled row in Phase 2 exactly. If a step is marked
[UNCERTAIN], it may still serve as a falsification anchor -- note the uncertainty in the
indicator description.

-- CONDITIONAL BRANCH: incomplete pathway --

If PATHWAY INCOMPLETE was declared in Phase 1, this branch applies.

Do NOT defer falsification. Do NOT write:
  - "Cannot falsify until the mechanism is better understood."
  - "Falsification depends on completing the pathway."
  - A metric threshold ("if Y does not improve").

PROHIBITED FORM: Declaring incompleteness and deferring or omitting step-level
falsification does not pass. A response that declares PATHWAY INCOMPLETE in Phase 1 and
then produces no step-level anchor -- writing deferral language or a metric threshold in
its place -- has not satisfied this section regardless of how accurately incompleteness was
declared. The incompleteness declaration removes the completeness requirement from the
anchor format; it does not remove the requirement to name an anchor. A pathway with one
traceable step produces one falsifiable break point. Incompleteness changes the confidence
annotation -- not the structural requirement to name a step-level anchor.

Instead: identify the highest-confidence labeled step traced and anchor falsification there.

Required format:
"BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR: The mechanism fails if Step [N] -- [Name] -- does not occur,
observable as [indicator]. Note: pathway incompleteness means the chain cannot be verified
beyond step [N]. Further falsification requires establishing [missing knowledge from
Phase 1]."

-- END CONDITIONAL BRANCH --

Do not state falsification as a metric threshold. A metric shortfall is an outcome check.
Name where the mechanism stops working.

=== PHASE 4: CONTEXT EVIDENCE ===

Assess evidence per pathway step using the formal labels from Phase 2.

For each step:
  Step N -- [Name]: [evidence name, artifact, or "no evidence"] -- [T1 / T2 / T3 / none]
    T1 = anecdotal / observational / team intuition
    T2 = correlation / A-B / usage analytics / survey
    T3 = controlled / causal-inference-grade experiment

Reference steps by their formal Phase 2 label -- not by position or paraphrase.

FIELD INDEPENDENCE NOTE: The following two outputs measure different things. Produce them
as two separate named entries. Do not merge them into a single entry. Do not omit either.

  Evidence gap steps: [list Step N -- [Name] labels with no supporting evidence; write
    "none" if every step has evidence -- the absence of a gap does not eliminate this
    field; this output answers: which steps lack supporting evidence?]

  Aggregate evidence tier: [highest tier available -- T1/T2/T3/none; this output answers:
    what is the quality of the evidence that exists? -- independent of which steps are
    missing; produce both fields in every output]

These fields are orthogonal: gap steps names which steps lack evidence; aggregate tier
rates the quality of the evidence that is present. One does not substitute for the other.

NULL-GAP COUNTEREXAMPLE: The following is a valid, required output state:
  Evidence gap steps: none
  Aggregate evidence tier: T1
This state means every step in the pathway has supporting evidence, and that evidence is
anecdotal-grade. The Evidence gap steps field still appears; it carries the value "none."
The Aggregate evidence tier field still appears; it carries the value T1. A response that
omits Aggregate evidence tier because all steps are covered is making the category error
that these fields guard against -- it is conflating "no missing steps" with "no tier to
report." The null-gap state proves the fields are independent: gap answers which steps are
missing (here: none); tier answers what quality the present evidence has (here: T1). Both
are always required. Both always carry a value, even when gap is none.

PROPAGATION REQUIREMENT: The Evidence gap steps field does not stay in Phase 4. It must
also appear as a standalone named entry in Phase 6 AMEND, separately from the Aggregate
evidence tier field. Having evidence gap output here in Phase 4 does not substitute for
having it in Phase 6 AMEND -- the gap must propagate from the source section to the
synthesis point. A response where Evidence gap steps appears in Phase 4 but is absent from
Phase 6 AMEND as a named standalone entry does not pass.

Do not substitute general research for team-specific evidence. Note external evidence
separately if useful, but do not include it in the tier accounting.

=== PHASE 5: CONFOUNDER CHECK ===

This phase asks a DIFFERENT question from Phase 0.

Phase 0 asked: does the status quo trend toward Y over time, without intervention?
This phase asks: what else, operating RIGHT NOW alongside X, could independently produce Y?

The inertia case (Phase 0) is EXCLUDED from this analysis. It does not count as a
confounder -- it was answered in its own phase with its own verdict.

What you are looking for -- simultaneously-operating causes, not counterfactuals:
  - Competing initiatives active during the same deployment window
  - Confounding variables that correlate with X adoption and independently predict Y
  - Selection effects: the population using X differs from those who do not
  - Environmental or seasonal effects coinciding with X's deployment period

Name at least one alternative explanation for Y that:
  (a) does not involve X as a cause, AND
  (b) is not the inertia/status-quo case already addressed in Phase 0.

Explicitly acknowledge the exclusion: "The inertia case (Phase 0 verdict: [verdict]) is
not included here -- it was handled separately in Phase 0."

If no independently-operating cause can be identified, explain why the mechanism is
insulated from this type of confounding for this outcome type. Silence is not acceptable.

=== PHASE 6: AMEND ===

Produce a narrowed version of the hypothesis that integrates all prior analytical phases.
This section has required named inputs from each phase. Omitting any of them does not pass.

Required structure:
  Original: {hypothesis}
  Inertia verdict: {from Phase 0 -- Competing / Not competing / Unclear}
  Mechanism completeness: {complete / incomplete at Step N / partial -- from Phase 1;
    this is a standalone named field; a mechanism qualifier embedded within the Amended
    clause text ("X causes Y when the mechanism is fully traceable") does not satisfy this
    field; the completeness status must appear here as a named entry separate from the
    amended clause; write "complete" if Phase 1 found no gaps; write "incomplete at Step N"
    if PATHWAY INCOMPLETE was declared; write "partial" if some steps are [UNCERTAIN]}
  Evidence tier: {aggregate tier from Phase 4 -- T1/T2/T3/none}
  Evidence gap: {step labels lacking support from Phase 4 -- or "none"; this is a separate
    field from Evidence tier -- having one does not satisfy the other; a pathway with no
    gap steps still requires this field, carrying the value "none"}
  Confounder finding: {from Phase 5 -- name the alternative cause identified, or
    "none identified -- [reason why mechanism is insulated]"}
  Active pathway: {primary / secondary / both / singular}
  Falsification: {Step N -- Name -- break condition, or BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR if incomplete}
  Amended: {narrower claim -- must include:
    (a) mechanism qualifier (what must be true in the causal chain for X to cause Y),
    (b) scope condition (population, context, or timeframe),
    (c) inertia incorporation -- required regardless of verdict value; no verdict makes
        inertia incorporation optional; use the form appropriate to the verdict:
          Competing: scope to contexts where the status quo does not already produce Y via
            [the competing mechanism]; or declare the feature causally redundant where the
            status quo already delivers Y
          Not competing: confirm explicitly that X is the causal driver and that the status
            quo does not independently produce Y -- this is a positive bounding condition
            that must appear in the amended claim, not be silently assumed
          Unclear: qualify the causal scope with the condition that status-quo independence
            has not been established -- the claim holds only if inertia can be ruled out for
            this context and population
    (d) confounder note if Phase 5 named a plausible alternative cause that bounds where
        the claim holds -- e.g., "provided [confounder] is not the active driver"}

Integration rules:
  - Evidence tier and Evidence gap are separate AMEND fields -- merging them or omitting
    either does not pass.
  - Mechanism completeness is a standalone named AMEND field -- embedding it within the
    amended clause text does not satisfy this field requirement.
  - A narrowed claim that ignores the inertia verdict does not pass -- no verdict value
    makes inertia incorporation optional.
  - Conditioning inertia incorporation on the verdict being Competing or Unclear does not
    pass -- all three verdict values require explicit reference in the amended claim. The
    Not competing case must shape the amended claim text; acknowledging it and then treating
    it as carrying no bounding force is the conditional form that fails.
  - Declaring incompleteness and deferring or omitting step-level falsification does not
    pass -- incompleteness changes the confidence annotation, not the structural requirement
    to name a step-level anchor; a PATHWAY INCOMPLETE response still carries a Falsification:
    field with a BEST-TRACEABLE ANCHOR value, not a deferral statement.
  - Evidence gap appearing only in Phase 4 (CONTEXT EVIDENCE) does not satisfy the Evidence
    gap AMEND field -- the gap must propagate from Phase 4 to Phase 6 as a standalone named
    entry; leaving it in Phase 4 does not pass. Just as Mechanism completeness must appear
    as a named AMEND field and not only in Phase 1, Evidence gap must appear as a named
    AMEND field and not only in Phase 4.
  - A narrowed claim that ignores mechanism incompleteness does not pass.
  - A narrowed claim that omits the confounder finding (when one was identified) does not
    pass. Partial synthesis is not synthesis -- all fields must be reflected.
  - Restating the original hypothesis does not pass. Broadening it does not pass.
