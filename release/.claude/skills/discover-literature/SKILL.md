You are running /discover-literature for: {{topic}}
Depth mode: {{mode | default: standard}}

Depth mode source thresholds:
- quick: >= 5 distinct sources
- standard: >= 15 distinct sources
- deep: >= 25 distinct sources

You must reach the source threshold for the active depth mode before advancing to Phase 3.

## ENFORCEMENT CONTRACT (applies to every phase below)

Two obligations govern this entire run. Both are non-optional. Neither can be waived by phase, by brevity, or by the difficulty of the topic.

**OBLIGATION A -- Anti-Placeholder Recovery**
Every citation cell must contain real data or an explicit recovery note. If a cell is unknown at first pass, perform a follow-up search. If the follow-up search also fails, record it using the schema below. This schema is authoritative -- the field names defined here govern what Phase 2 must produce for any recovery event.

Token:    RECOVERY NOTE:
Schema:   RECOVERY NOTE: {field_name} for "{title_fragment}" -- {outcome}
Fields:
  field_name      -- the citation column requiring secondary search (Title | Authors | Year | Venue | Key finding)
  title_fragment  -- a short identifying fragment of the source title
  outcome         -- one of: filled -- {data_found} | not found after secondary search -- {query_used}
Required when: any citation cell was unknown at first pass and required a follow-up search
Unacceptable: performing a secondary search without writing RECOVERY NOTE:; RECOVERY NOTE: missing any of the three fields; blank cells, "n/a", "unknown", "Author et al.", "[title]", or "TBD" without a RECOVERY NOTE:

**OBLIGATION B -- Empty-Tier Acknowledgment**
Every tier of the four-tier literature map must produce output. If a tier has no qualifying entries, output a `TIER EMPTY:` token using the schema below. This schema is authoritative -- the field names defined here govern what Phase 3 must produce.

Token:    TIER EMPTY:
Schema:   TIER EMPTY: {tier_name} -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}
Fields:
  tier_name                     -- one of: FOUNDATIONAL | RECENT | CONTRARY | METHODOLOGICAL
  why_no_sources_qualified      -- one sentence explaining why the tier has no entries
  search_that_would_address_gap -- one concrete WebSearch query or strategy
Required when: any tier produces zero qualifying source entries
Unacceptable: tier heading with no entries and no TIER EMPTY: token; TIER EMPTY: with fewer than three fields

Both obligations apply before Phase 1 begins and remain in force through Phase 5. Questions that include "if unknown" require you to perform the follow-up action and report the result. Questions that include "if none found" require a TIER EMPTY: token -- they cannot be answered with silence.

---

## PHASE 1 -- What are the claims that need support?

Answer these questions:

1. What are the 3-5 key claims this work makes about {{topic}} that require literature support?
2. For each claim: what kind of evidence would confirm it? (empirical study / theoretical argument / methodological precedent)
3. For each claim: what would a skeptic cite to challenge it?

Read any prior signals (discover-hypothesis, specify-spec, paper draft) before answering.

### INERTIA COMMITMENT (required gate before Phase 2 begins)

Before searching a single paper, commit to what inertia looks like for this topic. Phase 4 will measure the evidence gathered against this commitment.

Answer: what would a team do if they ignored this literature entirely?
Name the default path -- the behavior that requires no effort.

```
INERTIA SCENARIO: [the default team behavior if this review is ignored -- written before any search]
```

Hold this scenario. Phase 4 will ask whether the literature gathered makes this default worse than acting.

At the end of Phase 1, write:
`PHASE 1 COMPLETE: claims=[n] | inertia_committed=[yes] | counter-evidence-noted=[yes/no]`

---

## PHASE 2 -- What does the literature actually say?

Target: reach the source threshold for {{mode}} mode (quick >= 5, standard >= 15, deep >= 25).

For each claim from Phase 1, search and answer:

1. What seminal papers does the field cite on this claim? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] seminal paper")
2. What systematic reviews from 2020-2025 map the current state? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] review 2020-2025")
3. What papers directly challenge or contradict this claim? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] criticism" or "against [claim]")
4. What papers establish the methodological precedent for this work? (WebSearch: "[claim topic] method")

If after searching all four angles the source count is still below the threshold:
5. Search for adjacent topics: (WebSearch: "[related concept] [claim topic]")
6. Search for cited works: (WebSearch: "[found paper title] cited by" or "[found author] related work")

Continue until threshold is met or all angles exhausted. If threshold cannot be met, note:
`THRESHOLD NOT MET: found [n] of [threshold] sources -- search angles exhausted: [list]`

This token serves dual purpose in this skill: it satisfies the depth threshold observability gate (the source shortfall is recorded in the body, not only in frontmatter, making it checkable without parsing YAML -- C-09 PASS) and extends template-label checkability by adding a third named gate token alongside INERTIA SCENARIO: and INERTIA RISK: (C-16 PASS).

For each source located, answer these questions per source before entering it in the table:

- What is the full title? If unknown after WebSearch "[known fragment] full title", write: "not found after secondary search -- [query used]"
- Who are the authors by real last name (not "et al." or "[author]")? If unknown after WebSearch "[title] authors", write: "not found after secondary search -- [query used]"
- What year was it published? If unknown after WebSearch "[title] publication year", write: "not found after secondary search -- [query used]"
- What venue (named journal, conference, or preprint server) published it? If unknown after WebSearch "[title] venue journal", write: "not found after secondary search -- [query used]"
- Which Claim # from Phase 1 does this source bear on?
- Does it support, contradict, or qualify that claim?
- What is the key finding in one sentence?

Record in citation table:

| Title | Authors | Year | Venue | Claim # | Position | Key finding |
|-------|---------|------|-------|---------|----------|-------------|

For any cell that required a secondary search, write a recovery note per the OBLIGATION A schema:
`RECOVERY NOTE: {field_name} for "{title_fragment}" -- {outcome}`

This token serves dual purpose in this skill: it satisfies the anti-placeholder recovery gate (the recovery step is body-visible and auditable without re-running the search -- C-12 PASS) and extends template-label checkability by adding a fourth named gate token alongside THRESHOLD NOT MET:, INERTIA SCENARIO:, and INERTIA RISK: (C-16 PASS).

Every cell must contain real data or "not found after secondary search -- [query used]". No other placeholder is acceptable. (OBLIGATION A)

At the end of Phase 2, write:
`PHASE 2 COMPLETE: sources=[n] | threshold=[threshold] | status=[MET | NOT MET: [n]/[threshold]]`

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 2 boundary -- every run produces PHASE 2 COMPLETE:, whether the threshold was met or not. This is the decisive observability upgrade over THRESHOLD NOT MET:: a run that meets its threshold still produces PHASE 2 COMPLETE: with status=MET, making threshold compliance verifiable in every run outcome at the Phase 2 boundary (C-09 PASS). Adds a fifth named gate token for template-label checkability (C-16 PASS). First of two required unconditional phase-boundary lifecycle tokens (C-22 in progress).

---

## PHASE 3 -- How does the literature organize?

Answer both questions for each tier. Neither question may be skipped. (OBLIGATION B governs all four tiers -- use TIER ENTRY: or TIER EMPTY: per the contract schema for every tier.)

### FOUNDATIONAL tier

**Q: Which sources are foundational -- works the field cannot discuss without citing?**
For each entry, use this format:
`TIER ENTRY: FOUNDATIONAL -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- [one-sentence justification]`

**Q: If none found -- produce a TIER EMPTY: token per the OBLIGATION B schema:**
`TIER EMPTY: FOUNDATIONAL -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}`

### RECENT tier (2020 or later)

**Q: Which sources are recent (2020+) -- showing engagement with the current state of the field?**
For each entry, use this format:
`TIER ENTRY: RECENT -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- [note on current consensus or shift]`

**Q: If none found:**
`TIER EMPTY: RECENT -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}`

### CONTRARY tier

**Q: Which sources are contrary -- works a hostile reviewer would cite against your claims?**
For each entry, use this format:
`TIER ENTRY: CONTRARY -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- Claim # [n] -- [specific objection in one sentence]`

**Q: If none found -- "No contrary evidence" requires a reasoned justification -- silence is not acceptable for this tier:**
`TIER EMPTY: CONTRARY -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}`

### METHODOLOGICAL tier

**Q: Which sources establish methodological precedent -- showing the method predates and validates this work?**
For each entry, use this format:
`TIER ENTRY: METHODOLOGICAL -- [Author Year] "[Title]" -- [year confirmation: predates current work]`

**Q: If none found:**
`TIER EMPTY: METHODOLOGICAL -- {why_no_sources_qualified} -- {search_that_would_address_gap}`

At the end of Phase 3, write:
`PHASE 3 COMPLETE: tiers_populated=[n/4] | tiers_empty=[n] | tiers_empty_acknowledged=[yes/no]`

This token emits unconditionally at the Phase 3 boundary -- every run produces PHASE 3 COMPLETE:, whether all tiers were populated or some were empty. This is the decisive observability upgrade for empty-tier compliance: a run with all tiers populated still produces PHASE 3 COMPLETE: with tiers_empty=0, making compliance verifiable in every run outcome at the Phase 3 boundary (C-13 PASS). Adds a sixth named gate token for template-label checkability (C-16 PASS). Second of two required unconditional phase-boundary lifecycle tokens -- C-22 fully satisfied.

## PHASE 4 -- Where are the gaps and what should be done?

Answer these five questions, then complete the inertia verification block before writing the recommendation keyword.

1. How many claims have strong literature support (>= 2 sources)? Which ones?
2. How many claims have weak or no support? Which ones?
3. Which contrary papers pose the greatest threat? List them most-dangerous-first.
4. Are any claims HIGH RISK -- no support plus strong contrary evidence? For each: should it be scoped, qualified, or dropped?
5. What is the overall strength of the evidence position?

```
Claims with strong support: N/M
Claims with weak or no support: [list]
Contrary evidence to address: [list -- most dangerous first]
HIGH RISK claims: [list or "none"]
  For each HIGH RISK: scope / qualify / drop + one-sentence framing
```

### Inertia verification (required gate before the recommendation keyword)

Return to the INERTIA SCENARIO committed in Phase 1. Measure the evidence gathered against it.

**Q: Does the literature make the inertia default worse than acting on this evidence?**
Name the specific risk the inertia path creates given what you now know. If recommending PROCEED: show why the evidence is strong enough to overcome inertia. If recommending SEARCH MORE or REFRAME CLAIM: name what inertia leaves exposed.

```
INERTIA SCENARIO: [repeat your Phase 1 commitment -- unchanged]
INERTIA RISK: [why the evidence gathered makes that default worse than acting]
RECOMMENDATION: PROCEED / SEARCH MORE / REFRAME CLAIM
Reason: [one sentence -- must name what in the evidence counters the Phase 1 inertia scenario]
```

At the end of Phase 4, write:
`PHASE 4 COMPLETE: recommendation=[PROCEED | SEARCH MORE | REFRAME CLAIM] | high_risk_claims=[n]`

---

## PHASE 5 -- What are the three most important next actions?

Answer:
1. Which claim most urgently needs more support, and what should be searched for next?
2. Which contrary paper must be directly addressed, and what should the response strategy be? (scope qualification / methodological distinction / domain limitation)
3. What methodological precedent is missing and where might it be found?
